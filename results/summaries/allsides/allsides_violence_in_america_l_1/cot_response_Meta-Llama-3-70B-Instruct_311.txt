SUMMARY:
A fatal shooting occurred in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire on a crowd in a parking lot, resulting in the death of one man. The incident followed a night of destructive protests over the fatal police shootings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. According to authorities, someone in the crowd fired at the officers, prompting them to return fire. The shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice in the death of the unarmed 26-year-old Taylor, who was killed in her apartment when police broke down her door to serve a warrant. The incident highlights the serious issue of mistrust between the police and the community, which will need to be addressed in the long run. The police are investigating the incident and have pledged to release video footage to the public soon. END OF SUMMARY.
