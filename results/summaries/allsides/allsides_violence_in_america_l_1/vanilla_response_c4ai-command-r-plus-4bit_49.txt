SUMMARY: One man was killed in Louisville early Monday when the National Guard and police returned fire after someone in a crowd shot at them, authorities said. The incident took place around 12:15 a.m. in a parking lot where a large crowd had gathered. It was not clear if the crowd was related to the protests over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said the Kentucky National Guard and Louisville police were trying to disperse the crowd when they were shot at. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the fatal shooting. Conrad said the police are interviewing witnesses and collecting video footage, which will be released to the public soon. The shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American woman who was fatally shot by police in March.
END OF SUMMARY.
