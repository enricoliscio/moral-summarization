SUMMARY:
In the early morning hours of Monday, a man was fatally shot by the National Guard and Louisville police in a parking lot. The incident occurred amid ongoing destructive protests demanding justice for the recent deaths of two unarmed African Americans at the hands of police: Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The governor has authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting. 

The police chief, Steve Conrad, acknowledged the underlying issue of distrust towards law enforcement in the community, especially given the assault on officers that took place during the incident. Conrad emphasized the challenge of rebuilding trust between citizens and the police, a process he admits will take a long time. The identity of the deceased man has not been released, and it is unclear if the crowd in the parking lot was directly related to the protests. 

This tragic shooting is likely to exacerbate tensions in Louisville, where residents are still reeling from the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed 26-year-old EMT who was fatally shot by police in March. Taylor's death, which occurred as police broke down her door to serve a warrant, has sparked widespread outrage and calls for justice. 

END OF SUMMARY.
