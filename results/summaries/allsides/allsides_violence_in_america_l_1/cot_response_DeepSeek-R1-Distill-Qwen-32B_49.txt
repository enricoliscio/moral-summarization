Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context and identify the morally charged words. The article talks about a fatal shooting involving police and the National Guard during a protest. There are terms like "violent confrontation," "destructive protests," "fatal shooting," "trusting the police," and "justice." These words carry moral implications, so I need to include them in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main points: the shooting incident, the involvement of authorities, the context of previous protests over Breonna Taylor's death, and the resulting tension. I should make sure the summary flows logically and includes all key details without exceeding 200 words. I also need to maintain the moral perspective, highlighting the lack of trust in police and the ongoing demand for justice. 

I'll start by mentioning the shooting, then the governor's investigation, followed by the police chief's statement about the confrontation and the crowd's actions. I'll note the impact on tensions in Louisville and the background of Breonna Taylor's case. Finally, I'll conclude with the police's efforts to investigate and the implications for trust in law enforcement.

**SUMMARY:**  
A man was shot and killed in Louisville after police and the National Guard opened fire during a violent confrontation with a crowd. The incident occurred as law enforcement tried to disperse a large gathering at Dino’s Food Mart following nights of destructive protests over the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor and the death of George Floyd. Someone in the crowd fired at officers, leading to a return of fire, which resulted in the man’s death. Police Chief Steve Conrad emphasized that officers were working hard to keep people safe and protect property but acknowledged that many do not trust the police, a issue that will require long-term resolution. The shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT killed during a police raid. The investigation into the fatal shooting is ongoing, with authorities collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses. END OF SUMMARY.
