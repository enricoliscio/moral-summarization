Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a conflict in Georgia involving voter registration and fraud allegations. 

Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor, is criticizing Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, for investigating voter registration efforts by the New Georgia Project. Warnock accused Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which is a strong statement. Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false info, which are felonies in Georgia. 

The context is the Senate race where Democrat Michelle Nunn is trailing Republican David Perdue. The New Georgia Project, led by Stacey Abrams, aims to register minority voters, which could impact the election. Kemp's investigation is seen as politically motivated, especially since it's an election year. Abrams and the project deny any wrongdoing and call the subpoena excessive. Kemp defends his actions, saying it's his duty to investigate fraud reports from counties. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Warnock's accusation, Kemp's investigation, the 28 fraud cases, the political stakes, and the双方的立场。确保涵盖所有关键信息，同时保持简洁。
