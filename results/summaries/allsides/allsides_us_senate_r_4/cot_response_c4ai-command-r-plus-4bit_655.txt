SUMMARY: 
In Georgia, a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive has sparked accusations of voter suppression. The New Georgia Project, associated with Rev. Raphael Warnock and Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, has been subpoenaed by Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp as part of an investigation into alleged fraud and forgery in voter registration applications. Warnock denounces the probe as voter suppression, equating it to the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp defends his actions, citing confirmed cases of fraud and suspicious activity, and emphasizing the seriousness of falsifying voter registration, a felony in Georgia. The situation is politically charged due to the tight race to replace a US Senate seat. Abrams calls the subpoena a "witch hunt" and a "fishing expedition," claiming it is an abuse of power that takes time away from their nonpartisan voter registration efforts. The group accuses Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation, while he maintains his duty to investigate reported fraud. Warnock demands an end to the "smear campaign," and Kemp asserts that he is doing his job amidst the "silly season" of politics. The moral framing of the article centers around allegations of fraud, suppression, and wrongdoing, with both sides presenting strong moral arguments.
