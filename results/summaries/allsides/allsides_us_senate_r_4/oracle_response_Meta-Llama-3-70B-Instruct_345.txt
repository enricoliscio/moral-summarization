SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation is a form of voter suppression, reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan's tactics. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, for fraud and forgery. The probe has found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information. Warnock and the project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, deny any wrongdoing and claim the investigation is a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power." They argue that the probe's focus on fraud and forgery has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts. Kemp insists that his office is simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. The issue has become highly politicized, with Warnock demanding that Kemp "stop this dog and pony show" and focus on registering eligible voters.
