SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression after Kemp's office launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. Warnock claimed that Kemp's actions were reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan's tactics. The investigation, led by Kemp's investigator Chris Harvey, found 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties, including forged signatures and false information. Kemp defended the probe, saying it was his duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams, was subpoenaed for documents related to the voter registration drive. Abrams claimed the subpoena was "overly burdensome" and an "abuse of power." The issue is sensitive due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss.

END OF SUMMARY.
