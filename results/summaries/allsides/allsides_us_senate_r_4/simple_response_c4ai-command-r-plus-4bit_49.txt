SUMMARY: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has launched an investigation into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for alleged fraud. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has strongly criticized the probe, accusing Kemp of voter suppression and comparing it to the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp maintains that the investigation is necessary due to confirmed cases of fraud and suspicious activity. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, has denied any wrongdoing and accused Kemp of abusing his power and engaging in a witch hunt. The group claims that Kemp's actions are suppressing minority voter registration and that his accusations are politically motivated due to the narrow margins in the upcoming Senate race. Kemp insists that he is simply doing his job and denies any allegations of racism or voter suppression. The investigation and its implications have sparked a heated debate, with Warnock demanding an end to the probe and Kemp defending it as a necessary step to ensure the integrity of the voting process.
END OF SUMMARY.
