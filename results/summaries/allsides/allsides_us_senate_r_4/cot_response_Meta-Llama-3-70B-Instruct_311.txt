SUMMARY:
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation was a "witch hunt" and a "fishing expedition" aimed at intimidating minority voters. Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases, which Warnock dismissed as a "dog and pony show." The probe has become politicized, with Warnock accusing Kemp of trying to disenfranchise minority voters. Kemp denied the allegations, saying his office was simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. The issue has taken on added significance due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. END OF SUMMARY.
