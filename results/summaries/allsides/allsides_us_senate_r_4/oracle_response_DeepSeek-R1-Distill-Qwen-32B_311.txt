Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor, criticizing Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp for a fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project, which is a voter registration drive aimed at minorities. Warnock accuses Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan to emphasize the moral issue. Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, and has subpoenaed the project. The project's leaders, including Stacey Abrams, argue that the investigation is an abuse of power and a witch hunt, hindering their efforts to register minority voters. The context is a tight Senate race, where getting more minorities to register could affect the outcome.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: suppression, wrong, figure, stop, charges, fraud, applications, forged, falsifying, felony, forgery, burdensome, abuse, hunt, subpoenas, accusations, campaign.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Warnock and Kemp, the accusations of fraud, the moral implications of voter suppression, and the political stakes involved. I'll need to mention the specific numbers, like the 28 cases of fraud, and the 85,000 new voters. Also, include the terms like subpoena, witch hunt, abuse of power, and felony.

I should start by introducing the main figures and their accusations, then explain the context of the voter registration drive and its political significance. I'll make sure to use the listed moral terms to frame the summary appropriately.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during a fraud probe into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive. Warnock linked Kemp's investigation to Georgia's history of racial discrimination, calling it "voter suppression" without needing to "wear a hood." Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, and issued subpoenas to the project. The New Georgia Project, led by Stacey Abrams, denied any wrongdoing, labeling the investigation a "witch hunt" and "abuse of power." Abrams and Warnock argued that the subpoenas were "overly burdensome," chilling efforts to register 85,000 new voters. Kemp defended his actions, stating it was his duty to investigate fraud and ensure fair elections. The dispute is politically charged, with the Senate race between Democrats and Republicans hinging on minority voter turnout. Kemp denied racism, while Warnock accused him of a "smear campaign." The conflict highlights tensions over voter registration and election integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
