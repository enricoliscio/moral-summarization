SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, denounced a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock stated, "You don't have to wear a hood... to be engaged in voter suppression. We know voter suppression when we see it." Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, for fraud and forgery. Kemp claims 28 cases of fraud have been confirmed, with falsified signatures and false information. Warnock and the NGP maintain their innocence, calling the subpoena "overly burdensome" and an "abuse of power." They accuse Kemp of a "witch hunt" and "fishing expedition" to intimidate and suppress minority voters. Kemp insists he is simply doing his job, investigating reports of fraud brought to his attention by several counties. The issue is critical, as the outcome of the Senate race between Michelle Nunn and David Perdue hangs in the balance.
