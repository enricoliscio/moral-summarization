Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, speaking out against a fraud probe into a voter registration drive. He's accusing Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, of voter suppression, even comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan. That's a strong statement, so I should note that.

Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project, which Warnock is associated with. The project aims to register over 100,000 minority voters. Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false info, which are felonies in Georgia. He's also subpoenaed the project for documents, which they're calling an abuse of power.

The context is the U.S. Senate race in Georgia, where Democrat Michelle Nunn is trailing Republican David Perdue. The project, founded by Stacey Abrams, who advises Nunn, is trying to register unregistered minorities. They argue that Kemp's actions are intimidating and politically motivated, especially since the election is close.

Kemp defends his investigation, saying it's his duty and that any valid registrations will be processed. The article ends by noting that the issue is highly politicized, especially with the upcoming election.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key players, their accusations, the investigation details, and the political context. I should make sure to mention the fraud cases, the subpoena, the accusations of voter suppression, and the implications for the election.
