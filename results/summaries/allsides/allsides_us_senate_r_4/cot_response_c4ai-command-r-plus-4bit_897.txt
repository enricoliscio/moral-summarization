SUMMARY: 
Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, has launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive led by the New Georgia Project, founded by Rev. Raphael Warnock. Warnock decried the investigation as voter suppression, harkening back to a dark period in the South's history. Kemp's office has confirmed cases of fraud and forgery in voter registration applications and canvassing sheets, with some cases still suspicious. The New Georgia Project, advising Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn, proclaims its innocence and accuses Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation. Kemp denies these claims, stating he is doing his job and investigating reports of fraud. With narrow margins in the race to replace a US Senator, the issue has become politicized. The NGP complains that the subpoena is burdensome and an abuse of power, taking time away from their drive. The moral framing of this article centers around fraud, suppression, and abuse of power.
END OF SUMMARY.
