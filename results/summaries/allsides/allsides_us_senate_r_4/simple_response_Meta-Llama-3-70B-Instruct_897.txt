SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, comparing him to the Ku Klux Klan, after Kemp's office launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. The investigation found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases, with some having forged signatures or false information. Kemp denied accusations of racism and voter suppression, stating his duty is to investigate reports of fraud. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, is accused of fraud and has been subpoenaed, with Abrams claiming the subpoena is "overly burdensome" and a "witch hunt." Warnock and Abrams argue that Kemp's actions are intimidating and suppressing minority voters, while Kemp insists he is simply doing his job. The issue is particularly sensitive due to the close race for U.S. Senate in Georgia.
