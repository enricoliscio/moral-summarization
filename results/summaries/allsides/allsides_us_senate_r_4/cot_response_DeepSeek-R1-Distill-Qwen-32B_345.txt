Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Rev. Warnock criticizing a fraud probe into a voter registration drive, which he links to voter suppression and the Ku Klux Klan. There's tension between Warnock's group, the New Georgia Project, and Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is investigating potential fraud. The article also mentions the political stakes in the Senate race.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. These are words that carry a strong moral connotation, like "fraud," "suppression," "wrong," "felony," "abuse," "witch hunt," "racist," "smear," "chilling," "false," "unfortunate," and "politicized." Each of these words is used in a way that conveys a moral judgment or implication.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll need to structure it to highlight the conflict between Warnock and Kemp, the accusations of fraud and voter suppression, and the political implications. I should mention the investigation, the subpoenas, the claims of witch hunts, and the impact on voter registration efforts.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll start by introducing Warnock's criticism, then Kemp's response, the details of the investigation, the political context, and the accusations from both sides. I'll make sure to include the key morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's concise, within the word limit, and that all the important points are covered without losing the moral nuances.

**STEP 1:**  
* Fraud  
* Suppression  
* Wrong  
* Felony  
* Abuse  
* Witch hunt  
* Racist  
* Smear  
* Chilling  
* False  
* Unfortunate  
* Politicized  

**SUMMARY:**  
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during a fraud probe into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive. Warnock linked Kemp's actions to Georgia's dark history of racial discrimination, charging that voter suppression doesn't require a "hood" or Ku Klux Klan membership. Kemp's office is investigating 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, and has issued a subpoena to the New Georgia Project. Kemp insists his investigation is necessary to prevent felony-level fraud and ensure fair elections. The New Georgia Project, led by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denies any wrongdoing, calling the subpoena an "abuse of power" and a "witch hunt." Warnock and Abrams accused Kemp of intimidating minority voters and conducting a "smear campaign," while Kemp denied the accusations, stating he is not a racist and is merely fulfilling his duty. The political stakes are high, as the registration drive could influence the outcome of Georgia's closely contested Senate race. Kemp maintains that valid registrations will be processed, but the investigation has sparked accusations of politicization and a "chilling effect" on voter registration efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
