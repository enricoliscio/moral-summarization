Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a conflict in Georgia involving voter registration. Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor, is criticizing a fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project, which he's associated with. The project aims to register minority voters. Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, a Republican, is leading the investigation, claiming there are 28 cases of fraud. Warnock and the project deny any wrongdoing and accuse Kemp of voter suppression.

The context is the upcoming Senate election, where Democrat Michelle Nunn is trailing Republican David Perdue. The New Georgia Project, founded by Stacey Abrams, a Democratic leader, is trying to register unregistered minorities to potentially swing the election. Kemp's investigation is seen as targeting this effort, with both sides accusing each other of overreach and abuse of power.

I should highlight the main points: the investigation, the accusations of voter suppression, the political stakes, and the claims of fraud. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key players, their accusations, and the implications for the election.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Rev. Warnock's comments, Kemp's investigation, the fraud claims, the project's response, and the political context. I'll make sure to mention the Senate race and the potential impact on voter registration efforts.

SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, linking the current fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project to the state's history of racial discrimination. Kemp's office is probing the project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, citing 28 confirmed cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information. Warnock and the project deny any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "witch hunt" and an abuse of power. The issue is politically charged, as the narrow Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue hinges on minority voter registration. Kemp insists his investigation is lawful and necessary, dismissing claims of racism. The conflict highlights tensions over voter registration efforts and political influence in Georgia's election process. END OF SUMMARY.
