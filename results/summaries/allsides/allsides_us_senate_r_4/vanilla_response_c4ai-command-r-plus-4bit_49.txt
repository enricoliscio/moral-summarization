SUMMARY: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project for alleged fraud in its minority voter registration drive. The group, associated with Rev. Raphael Warnock and Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams, aims to register 100,000 minority voters before the October 6 deadline. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in 14 counties. Warnock and Abrams have criticized the investigation as voter suppression and a witch hunt, while Kemp maintains that he is following up on reports of fraud and forgery. The issue has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss. Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn believes that registering more minority voters could help her defeat Republican David Perdue. The New Georgia Project has denied any wrongdoing and accused Kemp of voter suppression. Kemp insists that he is not blocking minority voter registration and is simply doing his job. The group claims that the investigation has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts.
