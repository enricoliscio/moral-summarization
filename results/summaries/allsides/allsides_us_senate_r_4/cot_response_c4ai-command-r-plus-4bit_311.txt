SUMMARY: 
The state of Georgia has launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive led by the New Georgia Project, headed by Rev. Raphael Warnock. Warnock has decried the investigation as voter suppression, harkening back to the dark history of the Ku Klux Klan in the South. The probe was initiated by Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, who claims there is evidence of fraud and forgery in the voter registration forms. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, is a nonpartisan effort to register more than 100,000 minority voters before the deadline. Abrams, who advises Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, maintains a clear separation between her work with the campaign and the voter drive. Kemp has subpoenaed the New Georgia Project, demanding documents and communications related to the drive. The group has fired back, accusing Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation, and stating that his use of words like "fraud," "forgery," and "felony" has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts. Warnock and Abrams have called the investigation a "witch hunt" and a "smear campaign," while Kemp defends his actions as part of his job to investigate reports of fraud. The case has become politicized, with narrow margins in the race to replace a retiring U.S. senator from Georgia.
