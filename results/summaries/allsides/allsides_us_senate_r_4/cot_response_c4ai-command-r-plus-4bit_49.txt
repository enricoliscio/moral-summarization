SUMMARY: 
The state of Georgia has launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive led by the New Georgia Project, headed by Rev. Raphael Warnock and Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams. Warnock decried the probe as voter suppression, harkening back to the dark history of the Ku Klux Klan in the South. Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating claims of fraud, with 28 confirmed cases of fraudulent voter registration applications and three fraudulent canvassing sheets in 14 counties. Kemp has subpoenaed the New Georgia Project, demanding all documents and communications related to the drive. The group has fired back, proclaiming its innocence and accusing Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression, intimidation, and a smear campaign. Abrams maintains a wall of separation between her work with the Democratic campaign and the nonpartisan effort to increase minority voter turnout. Kemp insists he is doing his duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery, which were brought to his attention by several counties. The issue has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace a retiring U.S. senator.
