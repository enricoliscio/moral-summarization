SUMMARY: Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp has launched a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive led by the New Georgia Project, sparking accusations of voter suppression and racism. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, compared Kemp's actions to the Ku Klux Klan, stating that voter suppression is still prevalent regardless of whether one wears a hood. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in the New Georgia Project's voter registration drive. In response, the New Georgia Project has proclaimed its innocence and accused Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation, claiming that his actions are hindering their efforts to register new voters. Kemp maintains that he is simply performing his duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery and that his office is not blocking the registration of minority voters. The investigation has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace a Republican U.S. Senator from Georgia, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn narrowly trailing her Republican opponent. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, a Nunn adviser, has called the subpoena demanding documents and communications related to the voter registration drive "an abuse of power." Kemp, who denies being a racist, insists that he is carrying out his job and investigating reports of fraud.
END OF SUMMARY.
