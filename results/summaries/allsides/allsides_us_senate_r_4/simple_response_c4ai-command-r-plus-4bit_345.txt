SUMMARY: Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp has launched an investigation into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive associated with Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. Kemp's office has received reports of fraud and forgery in voter registration applications and canvassing sheets from multiple counties. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, has been accused of committing fraud in its drive to register more than 100,000 minority voters. Kemp has issued a subpoena for all documents and communications related to the voter registration drive, while the New Georgia Project has proclaimed its innocence and accused Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation. Warnock and Abrams have strongly criticized Kemp's investigation, with Warnock comparing it to the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp maintains that he is simply doing his job and investigating reports of fraud, and that any valid voter registration forms will be processed. The investigation has sparked moral outrage, with critics arguing that the use of the words fraud, forgery, and felony creates a chilling effect on minority voter registration efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
