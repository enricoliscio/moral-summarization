SUMMARY: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project for possible voter registration fraud. The group, associated with Rev. Raphael Warnock, has registered over 100,000 minority voters ahead of the October 6 deadline. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in 14 counties. The New Georgia Project maintains its innocence and accuses Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation, claiming that he is blocking the registration of minority voters. Kemp denies these claims and asserts that his job is to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. With a close Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, the issue has become highly politicized. Warnock and the New Georgia Project demand that Kemp stop his investigation, which they call a "witch hunt," while Kemp maintains that he is simply doing his job and ensuring fair elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
