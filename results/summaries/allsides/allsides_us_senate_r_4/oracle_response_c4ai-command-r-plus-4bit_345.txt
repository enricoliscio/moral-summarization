SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, likening his actions to those of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a group associated with Warnock, for alleged fraud in its minority voter registration drive. Kemp's investigator confirmed cases of fraud and forgery in voter registration applications, while the New Georgia Project denies any wrongdoing and accuses Kemp of a witch hunt and voter suppression. The group claims that Kemp's use of words like "fraud," "forgery," and "felony" is intimidating and has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts. Kemp maintains that he is simply doing his job by investigating reports of fraud and that he is not blocking the registration of minority voters. The issue has become highly politicized due to the tight race to replace a US Senate seat in Georgia.

END OF SUMMARY.
