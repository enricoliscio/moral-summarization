SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, likening his actions to those of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for fraud. Warnock claims Kemp is trying to intimidate and suppress minority voters, while Kemp insists he is simply doing his job by investigating reports of fraud and forgery. The New Georgia Project has registered over 85,000 new voters, but only 51,000 have been processed. Kemp's investigation has sparked accusations of racism and voter suppression, with Warnock demanding that Kemp stop the "dog and pony show" and do his job. The issue is particularly contentious in the closely contested Senate race, where Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn is relying on minority voter turnout to win.
