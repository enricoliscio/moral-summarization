Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock and the New Georgia Project being investigated for voter registration fraud by Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp. 

First, I should identify the key points: Warnock accuses Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which ties it to a dark past. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which is trying to register minority voters. They found some cases of fraud, but the project claims it's following the law and that the investigation is a witch hunt. 

I need to maintain the moral tone, so I'll highlight the accusations of voter suppression and the potential impact on the election. Also, the political stakes are high because of the close race for the Senate seat. 

I should structure the summary to include Warnock's accusation, Kemp's response, the details of the investigation, the project's defense, and the broader implications for the election. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but cover all necessary points.

Let me make sure to include that the investigation could affect the registration process and the election outcome. Also, mention that Kemp denies the accusations and is just doing his job. 

I should end by noting that the issue is highly politicized, which ties back to the moral framing of voter suppression versus fraud prevention.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during a fraud probe into the New Georgia Project, a voter registration drive targeting minority voters. Warnock linked Kemp's actions to the Ku Klux Klan, referencing a dark chapter in Southern history. Kemp's office is investigating 28 cases of alleged fraud, including forged signatures and false information, in voter registration applications. The New Georgia Project, led by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "witch hunt" and "abuse of power." Kemp defended his actions, stating it was his duty to investigate fraud reports from multiple counties. The issue is politically charged, as the upcoming Senate race in Georgia is tight, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn narrowly trailing Republican David Perdue. Warnock and Abrams argue that Kemp's investigation is intimidating and chilling efforts to register minority voters. Kemp insists he is not suppressing voters and is merely fulfilling his legal obligation. The dispute highlights tensions between fraud prevention and voter access, with both sides accusing the other of overreach.
