Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, up to 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rev. Warnock accusing Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, of voter suppression through a fraud investigation targeting the New Georgia Project, which is trying to register minority voters. Kemp's office found some fraudulent applications and is investigating. The article mentions the political stakes, as there's a close Senate race, and the project is linked to a Democratic candidate.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words used by the author: suppression, wrong, figure, stop, charges, fraud, applications, forged, falsifying, felony, forgery, burdensome, abuse, hunt, subpoenas, accusations, campaign.

I should make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll start by stating the accusation of voter suppression, mention the fraud investigation, the findings of forged applications, and the felony charges. Then, I'll note the political context and the claims of abuse of power and witch hunt. Finally, I'll include Kemp's defense and the ongoing tension.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing words. I'll structure it to show the conflict between Warnock and Kemp, the accusations, and the implications for the election.

SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, linking the current fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project to a history of racial discrimination. Kemp's office is probing the project, which aims to register minority voters, after finding 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information. Warnock and project leader Stacey Abrams allege Kemp is engaged in a "witch hunt" and "abuse of power," claiming the subpoena demanding documents is overly burdensome. Kemp insists his investigation is necessary to stop fraud and ensure fair elections, dismissing accusations of racism. The political stakes are high, with a tight Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue. The dispute highlights tensions over voter registration efforts and allegations of suppression, with both sides framing the issue as a moral and legal battle. END OF SUMMARY.
