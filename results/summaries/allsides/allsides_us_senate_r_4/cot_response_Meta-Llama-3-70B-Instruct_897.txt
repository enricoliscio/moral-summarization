SUMMARY:
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, denounced a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation was a "witch hunt" and a "fishing expedition" aimed at intimidating minority voters. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties, including forged signatures and false information. The issue is critical in the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Warnock and the New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, maintain that Kemp's actions are a form of voter suppression, while Kemp insists he is simply doing his job to prevent fraud. The dispute has become highly politicized, with both sides accusing each other of wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
