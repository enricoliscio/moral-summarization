Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor in Atlanta, speaking out against a fraud investigation by Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp into a voter registration drive by the New Georgia Project. Warnock is associated with this project, which aims to register minority voters. 

Kemp's office is investigating whether there's fraud in the registration process, claiming they've found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information. Warnock accused Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which is a strong statement. Kemp denied the accusations, saying he's just doing his job to prevent fraud.

The article also mentions the context of the upcoming Senate race in Georgia, where the margins are tight. The New Georgia Project, led by Stacey Abrams, a Democratic strategist, is trying to register minority voters, which could impact the election. Kemp's investigation is seen as politically motivated by the project, which accuses him of abusing power and intimidating voters.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Warnock's accusation, Kemp's investigation, the context of the election, and the political implications. I should make sure to include both sides' perspectives and the impact on the voter registration efforts.
