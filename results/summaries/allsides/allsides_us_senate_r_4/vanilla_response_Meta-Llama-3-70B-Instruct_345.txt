SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, denounced a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, after finding 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases. Warnock claimed that Kemp's actions are reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan's voter suppression tactics. Kemp denied the allegations, stating that his office is simply investigating reports of fraud and forgery. The issue is sensitive due to the close race for U.S. Senate, where Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn is narrowly trailing Republican David Perdue. The New Georgia Project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claims the subpoena is "overly burdensome" and an "abuse of power." The controversy has become politicized, with both sides accusing each other of wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
