SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of engaging in voter suppression by launching a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. Warnock likened Kemp's actions to those of the Ku Klux Klan, saying "you don't have to wear a hood" to suppress voters. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, for alleged fraud. The probe has found 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties, including forged signatures and false information. Warnock and the project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claim the investigation is a "witch hunt" and an abuse of power, aimed at intimidating minority voters. Kemp denies the allegations, saying his office is simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud. The issue has become highly politicized, with the outcome potentially affecting the tight Senate race in Georgia. END OF SUMMARY.
