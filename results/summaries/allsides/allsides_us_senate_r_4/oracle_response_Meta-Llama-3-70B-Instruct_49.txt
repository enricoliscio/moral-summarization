SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of engaging in "voter suppression" by launching a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. Warnock condemned the investigation, saying "you don't have to wear a hood... to be engaged in voter suppression. We know voter suppression when we see it." Kemp's office claims to have found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, which is a felony in Georgia. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denies any wrongdoing and calls the subpoena "overly burdensome and an abuse of power." Warnock demands that Kemp "stop this dog and pony show" and do his job, while Kemp insists he is simply investigating reports of fraud and forgery. The controversy has become politicized, with Warnock accusing Kemp of a "witch hunt" and Kemp denying any racist motives. END OF SUMMARY.
