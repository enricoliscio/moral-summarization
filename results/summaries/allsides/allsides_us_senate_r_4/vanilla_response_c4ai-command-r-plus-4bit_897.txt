SUMMARY: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for possible fraud. The group's leaders, including Rev. Raphael Warnock and Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams, have denied any wrongdoing and accused Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases out of over 100,000 registrations. The investigation has sparked controversy due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss and the potential impact of minority voters. Abrams maintains that the New Georgia Project is nonpartisan, while Kemp defends his investigation as a response to reports of fraud and forgery. The group has accused Kemp of a smear campaign and demanded he stop the investigation. Kemp maintains that he is doing his job and that valid voter registrations will be processed. The case has become highly politicized ahead of the November elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
