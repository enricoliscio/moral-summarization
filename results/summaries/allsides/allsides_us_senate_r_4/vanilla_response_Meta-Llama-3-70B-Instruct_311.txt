SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression over a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. Warnock's group, the New Georgia Project, aims to register over 100,000 minority voters before the October 6 deadline. Kemp's office is investigating 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, which is a felony in Georgia. Warnock and the project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claim the probe is a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power" aimed at suppressing minority votes. Kemp denies the allegations, saying his office is simply investigating reports of fraud brought to his attention by several counties. The issue is critical in the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, where Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn is narrowly trailing Republican David Perdue.

END OF SUMMARY.
