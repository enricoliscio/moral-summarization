Okay, so the user has given me a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They've also provided a list of morally framed words to include. First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about Rev. Raphael Warnock accusing Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, of voter suppression through a fraud investigation targeting the New Georgia Project, which aims to register minority voters.

I should identify the key elements: the accusation of voter suppression, the fraud investigation, the mention of the Ku Klux Klan, the specific cases of fraud, and the political implications with the Senate race. Also, the moral words like suppression, fraud, felony, abuse, etc., need to be included.

I need to structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Warnock and Kemp, the investigation details, and the political context. I should make sure to use as many of the provided moral terms as possible without making the summary too lengthy. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise.

I'll start by introducing Warnock's accusation, mention the fraud cases, Kemp's response, the subpoenas, and the political stakes. I'll also include the New Georgia Project's defense and the broader implications of voter suppression and fraud in the context of the election.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well, using the moral terms appropriately to convey the author's framing without adding any personal bias. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and direct.

SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the state's investigation into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive. Warnock linked the probe to Georgia's history of racial discrimination, asserting that voter suppression doesn't require Klan membership. Kemp's office has identified 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, and has issued a subpoena to the New Georgia Project, demanding documents. Warnock and the project deny any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power." Kemp insists his actions are lawful and necessary to prevent fraud, emphasizing that falsifying voter registration forms is a felony. The issue is politically charged, as the registration drive could impact the tight U.S. Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue. Warnock and the project argue that Kemp's actions chill voter registration efforts, while Kemp maintains he is fulfilling his duty to ensure election integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
