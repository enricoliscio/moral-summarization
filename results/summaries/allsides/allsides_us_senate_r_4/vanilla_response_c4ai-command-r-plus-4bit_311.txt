SUMMARY: Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for alleged fraud. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has criticized the probe as voter suppression, comparing it to the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases out of over 100,000 registrations, with some cases involving forged signatures and false information. The New Georgia Project maintains its innocence and accuses Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation. The group claims that Kemp's subpoena is burdensome and takes time away from their registration drive. Kemp denies blocking minority voter registration and asserts that any valid forms will be processed by county officials. The issue has become politicized due to the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn believes registering more minority voters could help her defeat Republican David Perdue.
END OF SUMMARY.
