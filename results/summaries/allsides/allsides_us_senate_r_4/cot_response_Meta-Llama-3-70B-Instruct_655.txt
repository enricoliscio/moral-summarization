SUMMARY:
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation was a "dark" attempt to disenfranchise minority voters, saying "you don't have to wear a hood to be engaged in voter suppression." Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, which is a felony in Georgia. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denies any wrongdoing and claims the subpoena is an "abuse of power" and a "witch hunt." The controversy has become politicized, with Warnock demanding that Kemp "stop this dog and pony show" and focus on registering voters. END OF SUMMARY.
