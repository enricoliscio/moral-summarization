SUMMARY: Reverend Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of engaging in voter suppression by investigating fraud allegations against the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive. Warnock's comments alluded to the Ku Klux Klan, sparking controversy. Kemp's office found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in 14 counties, with some forged signatures and false information. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, has been subpoenaed by Kemp, demanding documents related to the voter registration drive. Abrams claims the subpoena is burdensome and an abuse of power, taking time away from their voter registration efforts. She maintains a clear separation between her work with the Nunn campaign and the nonpartisan effort to increase minority voter turnout. Kemp defends his actions, stating he is simply investigating reports of fraud and forgery brought to his attention by counties. With a tight Senate race in Georgia, the issue has become highly politicized. Warnock demands Kemp stop the investigation, while Kemp insists he is doing his job. The moral framing in this article revolves around the concepts of voter suppression, fraud, abuse of power, and wrongful accusations.
