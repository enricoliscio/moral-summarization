SUMMARY:
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's office is engaged in a "witch hunt" and a "smear campaign" to discredit the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan effort to register minority voters. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases, which Warnock dismissed as a "dog and pony show." The investigation has sparked accusations of racism and voter intimidation, with Warnock stating that "you don't have to wear a hood" to be engaged in voter suppression. The issue is particularly contentious due to the narrow margins in the Senate race, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn hoping to make inroads with minority voters. END OF SUMMARY.
