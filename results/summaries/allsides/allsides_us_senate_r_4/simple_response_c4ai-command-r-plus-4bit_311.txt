SUMMARY: Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp has launched an investigation into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for alleged fraud. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has strongly criticized the probe, accusing Kemp of voter suppression and harkening back to the dark history of racism in the South. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases out of over 100,000 registrations, with some cases involving forged signatures and false information. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, maintains its innocence and accuses Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation. Abrams, who advises Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, claims the subpoena demanding documents and communications related to the drive is an abuse of power. Kemp, who denies being a racist, asserts that he is simply performing his duty to investigate reports of fraud. The issue has become highly politicized, with narrow margins expected in the race to replace retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss.
END OF SUMMARY.
