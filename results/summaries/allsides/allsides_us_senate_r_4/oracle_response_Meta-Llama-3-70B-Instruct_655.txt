SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock stated, "You don't have to wear a hood... to be engaged in voter suppression. We know voter suppression when we see it." Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, for fraud and forgery. Kemp claims there are 28 confirmed cases of fraud, with falsified signatures and false information. Warnock and the NGP deny any wrongdoing, calling the probe a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power." They argue that the investigation is a form of voter intimidation, aimed at stopping minority voters from registering. The NGP claims that 51,000 of the 85,000 new voters they've signed up have not yet been registered, while Kemp insists that any valid forms will be processed. The dispute has become highly politicized, with both sides accusing each other of wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
