SUMMARY: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for alleged fraud. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Kemp of voter suppression, drawing comparisons to the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in 14 counties, with some cases involving forged signatures and false information. The New Georgia Project maintains its innocence and accuses Kemp of voter suppression, claiming that he is blocking the registration of minority voters. Kemp denies these claims and asserts that he is investigating reports of fraud and forgery. The investigation has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss. Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn believes that registering more minority voters could help her defeat Republican David Perdue. The New Georgia Project claims that Kemp's subpoena is burdensome and an abuse of power, taking time away from their registration drive. Kemp insists that he is fulfilling his duty to investigate fraud and that any valid voter registration forms will be processed. The controversy highlights the ongoing tensions between efforts to increase minority voter participation and allegations of voter suppression in Georgia.
