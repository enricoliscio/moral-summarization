SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, drawing a comparison to the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive associated with Warnock, for alleged fraud. Kemp's investigator confirmed 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in 14 counties. The New Georgia Project denies any wrongdoing and accuses Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation, claiming that his use of words like "fraud," "forgery," and "felony" has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts. Kemp maintains that he is simply doing his job and investigating reports of fraud. The issue has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace a U.S. Senator from Georgia.

END OF SUMMARY.
