Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor, and his criticism of Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp regarding a voter registration drive. 

First, I should identify the key points. Warnock is criticizing Kemp for launching a fraud probe against the New Georgia Project, which is trying to register minority voters. Warnock accuses Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which is a strong moral statement against racism and suppression. Kemp, on the other hand, is investigating the project for possible fraud, citing 28 cases, which he says is serious. 

The moral framing here is about voter suppression versus preventing fraud. Warnock is highlighting the historical context of racism in voting, while Kemp is focusing on the legal aspect of stopping fraud. The summary needs to capture both perspectives and the underlying moral arguments.

I should mention the main actors: Warnock, Kemp, the New Georgia Project, and the context of the election race. Also, note the accusations and the counter-accusations, like the subpoena and the claims of witch hunt. The stakes are high because the election is close, so the moral implications are significant for both sides.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too bogged down in details. The moral aspect is crucial, so I'll emphasize Warnock's accusation of voter suppression and Kemp's stance on preventing fraud, showing the tension between these two moral perspectives.

I should structure it by starting with Warnock's accusation, then Kemp's response, the investigation details, the political context, and the opposing viewpoints on the subpoena and fraud. Conclude by noting the high stakes and the ongoing conflict.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each moral point is clear and the summary flows logically.
