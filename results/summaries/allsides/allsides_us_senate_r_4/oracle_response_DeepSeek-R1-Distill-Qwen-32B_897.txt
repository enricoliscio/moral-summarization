Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor, criticizing Georgia's Secretary of State Brian Kemp for investigating voter registration fraud. Warnock accuses Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which is a strong moral statement. Kemp's office is looking into the New Georgia Project, which Warnock is associated with, and they found some fraudulent applications. Kemp says he's just doing his job, but Warnock and the project claim it's a witch hunt and an abuse of power. The project's leader, Stacey Abrams, says they're nonpartisan and following the law, but Kemp insists he's acting on reports from counties.

I need to include the morally charged words like suppression, fraud, forged, felony, abuse, witch hunt, etc. I should make sure the summary reflects the conflict between Warnock's accusations and Kemp's defense. Also, mention the political stakes with the Senate race, as that's a key context.

Let me structure the summary: start with Warnock's accusation, Kemp's response, the findings, the project's defense, and the political implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many moral terms as possible.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during a fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project, a voter registration drive. Warnock linked Kemp's actions to historical voter suppression, though Kemp denied racism, stating his office was investigating 28 confirmed cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information. Kemp emphasized his duty to stop fraud and bring charges, while Warnock and the project's founder, Stacey Abrams, accused Kemp of a witch hunt and abuse of power. Abrams called the subpoena "overly burdensome" and claimed the project was nonpartisan. Kemp insisted he was acting on county reports, but the project argued his actions chilled voter registration efforts. The political stakes are high, with a tight Senate race, and Kemp acknowledged the issue's politicization. END OF SUMMARY.
