SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, denounced a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of "voter suppression." Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation is a form of intimidation, saying "you don't have to wear a hood... to be engaged in voter suppression." Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, for fraud and forgery. The probe has confirmed 28 cases of fraud and labeled 26 others as suspicious. Warnock and the project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claim the investigation is a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power" aimed at suppressing minority votes. Kemp insists his office is simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. The issue has become highly politicized, with Warnock demanding that Kemp "stop this dog and pony show" and focus on registering valid voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
