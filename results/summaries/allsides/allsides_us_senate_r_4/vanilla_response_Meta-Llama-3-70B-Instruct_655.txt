SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, comparing him to the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive associated with Warnock, for fraud. The probe has found 28 confirmed cases of fraud in 14 counties, including forged signatures and false information. Kemp insists his office is not blocking minority voter registration and is simply investigating reports of fraud brought to his attention by several counties. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, claims innocence and says the subpoena is an "overly burdensome" abuse of power. The issue is sensitive due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn hoping to make inroads with minority voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
