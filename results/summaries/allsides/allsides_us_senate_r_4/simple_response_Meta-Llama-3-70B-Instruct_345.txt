SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, condemned a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock likened Kemp's actions to those of the Ku Klux Klan, saying "you don't have to wear a hood" to engage in voter suppression. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, after finding 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases. Kemp denies allegations of voter suppression, saying his duty is to investigate fraud. The issue is critical in the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, where Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn hopes to make inroads with minority voters. The New Georgia Project and its founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claim innocence and accuse Kemp of a "witch hunt" and "abuse of power."

END OF SUMMARY.
