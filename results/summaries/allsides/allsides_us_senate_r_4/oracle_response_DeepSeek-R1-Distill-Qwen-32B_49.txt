Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock accusing Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, of voter suppression through a fraud investigation into the New Georgia Project. Warnock uses strong moral language, comparing the situation to the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp is investigating voter registration efforts, claiming fraud, which is a felony. The project, led by Stacey Abrams, denies the allegations and accuses Kemp of abuse of power and a witch hunt.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key moral terms like suppression, fraud, forged, felony, abuse, witch hunt, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the accusations from both sides, and the implications for the election.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Warnock's accusations, Kemp's investigation, the claims of fraud, the response from the New Georgia Project, and the political stakes involved. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to frame the summary as the author intended.

Let me draft this, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included concisely.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during a fraud probe into the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive. Warnock linked Kemp's actions to a "dark period" in Southern history, charging that voter suppression doesn't require "a hood" or Ku Klux Klan membership. Kemp's office is investigating 28 confirmed cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, in 14 counties, with another 26 labeled suspicious. Falsifying voter registration forms is a felony in Georgia. Kemp insists his investigation is necessary to "stop" wrongdoing and prevent "charges" against those involved. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denies any wrongdoing, calling the subpoena "overly burdensome" and an "abuse of power." Abrams accused Kemp of a "witch hunt" and "fishing expedition," while Warnock demanded Kemp stop the "dog and pony show" of subpoenas and false accusations. Kemp maintains his duty is to investigate fraud reports from counties, though Warnock and Abrams claim his actions chill voter registration efforts. The politically charged issue looms over Georgia's tight Senate race, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn hoping to capitalize on minority voter turnout. END OF SUMMARY.
