SUMMARY: In Georgia, a fraud investigation has been launched into a minority voter registration drive led by the New Georgia Project, with Secretary of State Brian Kemp alleging instances of fraud and forgery in voter registration applications and canvassing sheets. This has sparked accusations of voter suppression and intimidation by Rev. Raphael Warnock and others, who argue that the investigation is an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters. Kemp denies these claims, stating that his office is simply fulfilling its duty to investigate reported instances of fraud. The issue has become highly politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace a Republican US Senator from Georgia, with Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn narrowly trailing her Republican opponent. The New Georgia Project maintains its innocence and accuses Kemp of abusing his power, while Kemp insists that he is committed to ensuring fair and accessible elections for all Georgians. The group is facing a subpoena for documents and communications related to the voter registration drive, with a deadline of next Friday. Warnock and others demand that Kemp stop the investigation, which they characterize as a "witch hunt" and a "smear campaign."
END OF SUMMARY.
