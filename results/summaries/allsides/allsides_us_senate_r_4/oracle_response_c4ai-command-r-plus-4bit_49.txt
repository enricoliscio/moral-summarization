SUMMARY: In Georgia, a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive has sparked accusations of voter suppression and racism against Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, strongly criticized Kemp's investigation of the New Georgia Project, accusing him of engaging in voter suppression tactics reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases in the Project's voter registration applications, with some bearing forged signatures and false information. Falsifying voter registration forms is a felony in Georgia, and Kemp maintains that his job is to investigate reports of fraud. The New Georgia Project, founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, has fired back at Kemp, denying any wrongdoing and accusing him of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation. They claim that his accusations are burdensome and an abuse of power, taking away valuable time from their voter registration drive. Kemp, who is investigating the group at the request of several counties, denies blocking the registration of minority voters and refutes the allegations of racism. The Project's supporters argue that Kemp's use of words like "fraud," "forgery," and "felony" has a chilling effect on organizations trying to register new voters. The dispute has become highly politicized due to the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss.
