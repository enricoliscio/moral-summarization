SUMMARY: 
In Georgia, a fraud probe has sparked moral outrage, with Rev. Raphael Warnock comparing it to the dark history of voter suppression in the South. The probe targets the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive associated with Warnock. Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, is investigating alleged fraud in the drive, with 28 confirmed cases of fraudulent applications and three false canvassing sheets. The group denies any wrongdoing and accuses Kemp of voter suppression and intimidation, claiming his actions have a chilling effect on minority voter registration. Kemp denies the accusations, stating his duty is to investigate reports of fraud, which he says have been brought to his attention by counties. The probe has political implications, with the race to replace a US Senator narrowly trailing and the Democratic candidate, Michelle Nunn, believing that registering more minority voters could win her the seat. The moral framing of the issue highlights the serious accusations of fraud, abuse of power, and racial injustice, with Warnock demanding an end to the "smear campaign." Kemp defends his actions as necessary to ensure fair elections during this "silly season" of politicization.
