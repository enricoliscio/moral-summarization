SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, likening his actions to those of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a minority voter registration drive, for fraud, citing 28 confirmed cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases. Warnock and the project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, claim the investigation is a "witch hunt" and an abuse of power, aimed at intimidating minority voters. Kemp denies the allegations, stating that his office is simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery. The issue is critical in the tight Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, where minority voter turnout could be decisive. Warnock and Abrams argue that Kemp's actions will have a chilling effect on voter registration drives, while Kemp insists he is ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.

END OF SUMMARY.
