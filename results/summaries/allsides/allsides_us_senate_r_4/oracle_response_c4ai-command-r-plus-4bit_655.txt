SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression, drawing a comparison to the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, a group associated with Warnock, for alleged fraud in its drive to register minority voters. Kemp's investigator confirmed cases of fraud and forgery in voter registration applications, with some cases labeled as suspicious. The New Georgia Project has denied any wrongdoing and accused Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation, claiming that his use of words like "fraud" and "forgery" has a chilling effect on voter registration efforts. Kemp maintains that he is simply doing his job and investigating reports of fraud, and that any valid voter registration forms will be processed. The issue has become politicized due to the narrow margins in the race to replace a US Senate seat in Georgia. The group has called the investigation a "witch hunt" and an "abuse of power."

END OF SUMMARY.
