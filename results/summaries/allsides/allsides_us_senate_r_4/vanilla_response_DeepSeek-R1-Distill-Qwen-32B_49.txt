Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor in Atlanta, who is criticizing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brian Kemp. Warnock is associated with the New Georgia Project, which is involved in voter registration. Kemp's office is investigating whether there was fraud in their efforts to register minority voters.

Warnock accused Kemp of voter suppression, referencing the Ku Klux Klan, which is a strong statement. Kemp, on the other hand, says they're investigating because there are clear wrongdoings, like forged signatures and false information in registration forms. He mentioned 28 confirmed cases of fraud and 26 suspicious ones.

The context is the upcoming Senate race in Georgia, where the margins are tight. The New Georgia Project is trying to register many minority voters, which could impact the election. Kemp's investigation is seen as a political move, especially since the project is linked to the Democratic candidate, Michelle Nunn.

The article also mentions that the New Georgia Project fired back, calling the subpoena from Kemp's office overly burdensome and an abuse of power. They denied any wrongdoing and accused Kemp of voter suppression tactics.

So, the key points are: Warnock's accusation of voter suppression, Kemp's investigation into fraud, the political stakes in the Senate race, and the tension between the two sides.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by introducing the main figures and their conflict. Then, mention the investigation details, the political context, and the accusations from both sides. I should keep it concise and make sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Introduce Warnock and Kemp's conflict, explain the investigation, the fraud cases, the political implications, and the opposing viewpoints. Make sure to include that the New Georgia Project is nonpartisan and the accusations of witch hunts.

I think that covers all the essential elements without going into too much detail. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression during an investigation into the New Georgia Project, a voter registration drive linked to Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn. Kemp's office is probing 28 confirmed cases of fraud, including forged signatures and false information, and 26 suspicious cases. Warnock likened the investigation to voter suppression tactics reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp defended the probe as necessary to prevent electoral fraud, emphasizing his commitment to upholding Georgia's election integrity. The New Georgia Project, led by Rep. Stacey Abrams, denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a "witch hunt" and "abuse of power." The political stakes are high as the Senate race between Nunn and Republican David Perdue is tight, with the project aiming to register 100,000 minority voters. Kemp insists his office is not blocking registrations and is fulfilling its duty to investigate fraud reports. The situation highlights the politicized nature of election integrity in Georgia. END OF SUMMARY.
