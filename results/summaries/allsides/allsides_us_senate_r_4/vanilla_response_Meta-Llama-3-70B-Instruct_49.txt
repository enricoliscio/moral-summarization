SUMMARY:

Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression over a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation is a form of voter suppression, evoking the Ku Klux Klan. Kemp's office is investigating the New Georgia Project, which aims to register over 100,000 minority voters, after finding 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases. The project's founder, Rep. Stacey Abrams, denies any wrongdoing and claims the subpoena is an abuse of power. The issue is critical in the tight race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, where Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn is narrowly trailing Republican David Perdue. Kemp insists his office is simply doing its duty to investigate reports of fraud and forgery.

END OF SUMMARY.
