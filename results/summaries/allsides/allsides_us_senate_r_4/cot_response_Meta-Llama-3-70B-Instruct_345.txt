SUMMARY:
Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, denounced a fraud probe into a minority voter registration drive, accusing Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression. Warnock claimed that Kemp's investigation was a form of intimidation, reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan's dark past. Kemp's office has found 28 cases of fraud and 26 suspicious cases, with some applications bearing forged signatures or false information. The New Georgia Project, founded by Rep. Stacey Abrams, maintains its innocence and claims the subpoena is an "overly burdensome and abusive" fishing expedition. The group accuses Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation, while Kemp insists he is simply doing his job. The controversy has become politicized, with both sides trading accusations of wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
