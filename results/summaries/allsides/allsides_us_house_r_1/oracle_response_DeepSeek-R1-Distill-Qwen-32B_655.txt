Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against Trump. Key points include Trump using his office for private gain, the Ukraine investigation, the quid pro quo, military aid withholding, and the moral arguments from both sides.

I need to make sure to include the words: use, gain, put, sham, corruption, subscribes. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, like Trump putting himself before the country and the Democrats' argument against his actions.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too bogged down in specifics. I'll start with Nadler's statement, then outline the charges, mention the Republicans' defense, and conclude with the ongoing process.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring the moral terms are included and the framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to make sure it's concise. Once done, I'll present it as per the user's instructions, using the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump used his public office for private gain, arguing that no public official, especially the president, should prioritize personal interests over the nation. Nadler described the impeachment process as a "solemn and serious undertaking" to address threats to American institutions, such as free and fair elections. He criticized Republicans for failing to see the case clearly, urging them to remove "their blinders." Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the impeachment effort a partisan "sham." The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross into criminality and defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine's natural gas company, Burisma. The case centers on a July 25 phone call where Trump pressed Ukraine President Zelensky for investigations, with a whistleblower accusing Trump of withholding military aid as leverage. Democrats argue this constitutes a quid pro quo, while Republicans contest the evidence. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that Trump denied any quid pro quo, though he presumed it was Trump's intent. The delay in military aid coincided with the whistleblower complaint, and Trump has acknowledged wanting to investigate Biden's alleged corruption. Republicans highlight Biden's own actions in Ukraine, including forcing the removal of a prosecutor linked to Burisma. Trump also sought to investigate a missing DNC server tied to Russian hacking, subscribing to the theory that it ended up in Ukraine. END OF SUMMARY.
