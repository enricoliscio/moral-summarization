SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler has argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, a serious threat to America's institutions and free and fair elections. Nadler stated that no public official should use their position for personal gain and that the president should put the country first. The impeachment case against Trump stems from his request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, with Democrats arguing that Trump engaged in bribery or extortion by withholding military aid as leverage. While Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment drive a "sham," Republicans have defended the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's lucrative role in a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father oversaw US policy in the country. The most powerful testimony in the impeachment inquiry came from Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Ukraine's president in exchange for investigations. Trump has acknowledged his desire for an investigation into alleged corruption involving the Bidens, with the elder Biden even boasting about forcing Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor, who was also looking into corruption allegations against a Ukrainian oligarch. The impeachment process is a solemn undertaking to address threats to America's institutions and uphold the Constitution.
