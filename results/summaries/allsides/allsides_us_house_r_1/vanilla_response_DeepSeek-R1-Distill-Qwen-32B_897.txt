Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it needs to be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Nadler, making the case for impeachment. They're arguing that Trump put himself before the country by using his office for personal gain, specifically in the Ukraine case.

The key elements here are the charges: abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress. These stem from Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The military aid being withheld as leverage is a critical point. The article mentions a whistleblower, a transcript, and the role of Giuliani. Also, Sondland's testimony is important, as he offered a quid pro quo but Trump denied it.

I should also note that Republicans argue Trump's actions weren't criminal, and they support the investigation into Hunter Biden's job. The article goes into some background about Biden's influence in Ukraine and the missing DNC server, but those might be secondary points.

I need to condense all this into a summary that includes the main charges, the context of the Ukraine call, the role of the whistleblower and Sondland, and the Republican response. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise and avoid too much detail.

Let me structure it: start with Nadler's statement, outline the charges, mention the Ukraine call and military aid, the whistleblower and Sondland's testimony, the Republican counterarguments, and the broader context of Biden's influence and the server. Make sure to highlight the quid pro quo as the crux of the case.

I'll also need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the committee's action, the evidence presented, the key testimonies, and the opposing viewpoints. Keeping each sentence focused on the main points without getting bogged down in specifics.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump prioritized personal gain over the nation, calling his actions a threat to U.S. institutions. Democrats accuse Trump of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump withheld $391 million in military aid as leverage, according to a whistleblower. A rough transcript did not show a direct quid pro quo, but Democrats argue the pressure campaign was implicit. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he offered a White House visit as leverage for the investigation, though Trump denied any quid pro quo. Republicans argue Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal, supporting the investigation into Hunter Biden's job at Burisma. The case also involves Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate a missing DNC server hacked by Russia. Trump faces charges based on the evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee and Judiciary Committee, with the impeachment process set to proceed. END OF SUMMARY.
