SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions constitute a serious threat to America's institutions, particularly free and fair elections. Nadler argued that Trump put his own interests before the country's, using his public office for private gain. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, citing abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter is at the heart of the impeachment case. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Nadler stressed that the Constitution and Trump's oath of office require the president to put the country first. The impeachment inquiry has revealed a pattern of abuse of power and pressure on Ukraine, with Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, conducting a "shadow" foreign policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
