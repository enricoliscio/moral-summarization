Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against President Trump. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article begins with Jerrold Nadler, the chairman, stating that Trump put himself before the country. He mentions that no public official, especially the president, should use their office for private gain. The committee is proceeding to write articles of impeachment, focusing on charges like abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. These charges stem from Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

The article then goes into details about the July 25 phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine's president for an investigation. A whistleblower accused Trump of withholding military aid as leverage. The White House released a transcript that didn't show a direct quid pro quo, but Democrats argue the pressure was implicit. Republicans defend Trump's actions as unconventional but not criminal, and they support investigating Hunter Biden's job at Burisma.

Gordon Sondland's testimony is highlighted, where he mentioned offering a White House visit as a quid pro quo, though Trump later denied it. The military aid was delayed for about two months, resuming after the whistleblower complaint was reported. Trump acknowledges wanting the investigation but denies wrongdoing, calling the impeachment a partisan effort.

Additionally, the article touches on Biden's role in Ukraine, including pressuring the prosecutor, and Trump's interest in the DNC server. Republicans argue that the server's disappearance is a mystery, supporting Trump's claims.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Nadler's statement, the charges, the phone call, the whistleblower, the quid pro quo, Sondland's testimony, the military aid delay, Biden's actions, and the DNC server. I'll make sure to include both Democratic and Republican perspectives.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce the House Judiciary Committee's action.
2. Mention Nadler's comments on Trump's self-interest.
3. Outline the charges and their basis in Trump's request to Ukraine.
4. Describe the July 25 phone call and the whistleblower's accusation.
5. Note the released transcript and the Democrats' argument about implicit pressure.
6. Highlight Sondland's testimony and Trump's denial.
7. Discuss the military aid delay and its resumption after the complaint.
8. Mention Biden's role in Ukraine and Trump's server investigation request.
9. Conclude with the partisan divide and the ongoing inquiry.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covers all key points, and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid getting bogged down in too many details, focusing on the essentials that explain the impeachment case against Trump.

SUMMARY: The House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerrold Nadler, has advanced the impeachment case against President Trump, accusing him of prioritizing personal gain over the nation. The charges include abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. A July 25 phone call revealed Trump's pressure on Ukraine's president for an investigation, with a whistleblower alleging Trump withheld military aid as leverage. Though a released transcript didn't show a direct quid pro quo, Democrats argue implicit pressure existed. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified about offering a White House visit as leverage, but Trump denied any such deal. The military aid was delayed until after the whistleblower complaint was reported. Trump acknowledges seeking the investigation but denies wrongdoing, calling the impeachment a partisan effort. Republicans argue Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal, supporting the investigation into Hunter Biden's job at Burisma. The case also involves Trump's request to investigate a DNC server hacked by Russia. The inquiry highlights a partisan divide, with Democrats emphasizing threats to democratic institutions and Republicans defending Trump's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
