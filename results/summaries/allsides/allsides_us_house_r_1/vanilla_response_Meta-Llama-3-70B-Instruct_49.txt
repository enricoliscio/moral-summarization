SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has summarized the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president put his own interests above the country's. Nadler stated that no public official, including the president, should use their office for personal gain. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, which are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans claim that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality.

END OF SUMMARY.
