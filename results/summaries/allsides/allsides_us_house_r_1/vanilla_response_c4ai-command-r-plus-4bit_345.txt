SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler presented the Democrat's impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the President put his personal interests before the country. Nadler stated that Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and withheld military aid as leverage. The case centers around a phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump requested a "favor." While no quid pro quo was explicitly mentioned in the call transcript, Democrats argue that the threat was understood. The key witness, Gordon Sondland, testified that he offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Zelensky in exchange for the investigations. Republicans defend Trump's actions as unconventional but not criminal and justify the investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. The impeachment articles are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. 

END OF SUMMARY.
