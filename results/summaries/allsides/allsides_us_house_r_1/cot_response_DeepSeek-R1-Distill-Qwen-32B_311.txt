Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article about the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. 

First, I should identify the morally charged words. Words like "abuse," "bribery," "obstructing," "favor," "abusing," "withholding," "quid pro quo," "extortion," "corruption," "fraud," "dishonesty," "undermining," "betrayal," "self-interest," "dishonest," "unethical," "unconstitutional," "betrayal," "dishonesty," "fraudulent," "corrupt," "dishonest," "unethical," "unconstitutional," and "betrayal" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary. I'll start by outlining the key points: the House Judiciary Committee's role, Nadler's arguments, the charges, Trump's denial, the Ukraine investigation, the withheld military aid, the whistleblower's complaint, the quid pro quo, testimonies, and the context of Biden's involvement.

I should ensure that the summary includes as many of the identified morally framed words as possible without making it too verbose. I'll structure it to highlight the main accusations and the opposing viewpoints, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll make sure to mention the charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing, Trump's denial, the Ukraine context, the military aid withholding, the whistleblower's role, the quid pro quo, and the testimonies. I'll also touch on the Biden's involvement to provide context.

Finally, I'll conclude by noting the ongoing nature of the impeachment inquiry and the moral implications, ensuring the summary reflects the ethical concerns presented in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerrold Nadler, is advancing impeachment charges against President Trump, accusing him of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress. Nadler emphasized that no president should prioritize self-interest over the nation, citing Trump's alleged quid pro quo scheme involving Ukraine. Trump requested an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, while withholding military aid from Ukraine. A whistleblower accused Trump of using his office for personal gain. Key testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland suggested a potential quid pro quo, though Trump denied any such arrangement. Republicans argue Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal, while Democrats maintain they undermine democratic institutions. The case hinges on whether Trump's actions constitute corruption or fraud. The inquiry continues as both sides clash over the morality and legality of Trump's conduct. END OF SUMMARY.
