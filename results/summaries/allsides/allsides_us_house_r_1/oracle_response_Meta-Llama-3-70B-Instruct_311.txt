SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler emphasized that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler argued that this is a serious threat to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections. He called the impeachment process a "solemn and serious undertaking" that Congress must engage in to address this corruption. Trump has denied wrongdoing, denouncing the impeachment drive as a partisan "sham." The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe, all stemming from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue that Trump's action, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment, using his power for personal gain and putting himself before the country.
