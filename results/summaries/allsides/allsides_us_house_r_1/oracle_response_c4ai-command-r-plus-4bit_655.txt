SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, specifically in his dealings with Ukraine. Nadler stated that Trump's actions posed a serious threat to America's institutions and free and fair elections. The impeachment case centers around Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joseph R. Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, despite Trump's denial of any wrongdoing. The case also involves Trump's alleged abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of the congressional probe. The Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo scheme, offering a White House visit in exchange for investigations. Although no witnesses directly linked the holdup of military assistance to the investigations, the delay in aid was noted. Trump has subscribed to unsubstantiated theories and continues to face scrutiny for his actions. Nadler emphasized the importance of putting the country first and upholding the Constitution and the oath of office.
