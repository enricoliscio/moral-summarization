SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler emphasized that no public official, especially the President, should prioritize personal interests over the nation's well-being. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, citing serious threats to America's institutions, including free and fair elections.

Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the impeachment drive a partisan "sham." However, Democrats argue that Trump's actions, including asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph Biden and his son Hunter, constitute abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality.

The impeachment case centers on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he pressed for a "favor" in investigating the Bidens and Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats contend that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans argue that the threat was not explicit.

END OF SUMMARY.
