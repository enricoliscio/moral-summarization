SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, a serious threat to America's institutions. Nadler emphasized that no public official should use their position for personal benefit and that the president should always put the country first. The impeachment case against Trump stems from his request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, during a phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, offering a "quid pro quo" transaction where military aid was withheld as leverage. Although Trump denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment drive a "sham," evidence suggests that Trump may have abused his power for personal gain. The case also involves the investigation of Hunter Biden's role at a Ukraine natural gas company, where he earned a high-paying job while his father oversaw US policy in Ukraine. The article also mentions Trump's interest in a missing DNC server, which he believes ended up in Ukraine, as part of his "shadow" foreign policy agenda.
END OF SUMMARY.
