Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the impeachment case against Trump, but they also want me to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without adding my own bias. 

First, I should read through the article carefully. It's about the House Judiciary Committee's move to draft impeachment articles against Trump, focusing on his actions regarding Ukraine. The key points are Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, withholding military aid, and the whistleblower's complaint. The Democrats argue this is abuse of power, while Republicans defend Trump's actions as not crossing into criminality.

I need to structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, like Trump putting himself before the country and the potential threat to democratic institutions. Also, mention the charges like abuse of power and bribery. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but comprehensive.

Wait, the user mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, I should ensure the summary reflects the moral implications without being too biased. I'll need to balance both sides: Democrats' arguments and Republicans' defenses.

Let me start by outlining the main points: Nadler's statement, the charges, the phone call, military aid, the quid pro quo, the whistleblower, and the Republican response. I should weave these into a coherent summary, emphasizing the moral framing around public office use and national interest.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details, but include enough to show the context. Also, mention the ongoing nature of the process and the implications for democracy. 

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to be concise, so every sentence should add value. Make sure to include key terms like "quid pro quo," "abuse of power," "bribery," and "obstruction." Also, note that Republicans argue Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal.

Finally, I'll structure it to flow logically: introduction of the case, the specific charges, the evidence presented, and the opposing viewpoints. That should cover the necessary points while preserving the moral angle.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions, including seeking a political favor from Ukraine in exchange for military aid, constitute a breach of public trust and prioritize personal gain over national interest. Nadler accused Trump of using his office for private benefit, violating his constitutional duty to serve the country first. The committee is preparing articles of impeachment, focusing on charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of Congress. Democrats argue Trump's actions threaten democratic institutions, while Republicans defend his conduct as non-criminal. Key evidence includes a phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine's president for investigations into Biden and his son, Hunter, and the withholding of military aid as leverage. Witnesses like Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified about Trump's indirect pressure, though no direct link between the aid delay and investigations was proven. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the process a partisan "sham." The case highlights a moral conflict over whether Trump's actions undermine democratic integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
