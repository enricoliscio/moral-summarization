SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has presented the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president prioritized his personal interests over the country's. Nadler stated that no public official, including the president, should use their office for personal gain. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, which are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, in which he asked for an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans claim that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality.

END OF SUMMARY.
