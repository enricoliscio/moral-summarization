Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the ethical implications and the arguments presented by both sides.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the House Judiciary Committee's move to draft articles of impeachment against Trump, with Democrats accusing him of putting himself before the country. They mention charges like abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, all linked to the Ukraine investigation involving Hunter Biden.

I need to highlight the moral arguments. Democrats argue that Trump prioritized his personal interests over the country, which is a significant ethical concern. They emphasize the importance of a president acting in the national interest, not for private gain. On the other hand, Republicans counter that Trump's actions, while unconventional, weren't criminal and that investigating Hunter Biden was legitimate.

I should also include key details like the phone call with Zelensky, the withheld military aid, and the whistleblower's complaint. These points support the Democrats' case of quid pro quo and potential bribery.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the Democrats' case, then the Republicans' defense, and mention the evidence and testimonies involved. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, showing both sides' ethical arguments.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the main accusation, then outline the charges, the Republican response, and the evidence presented. Finally, I'll conclude with the ongoing process and the moral implications.

SUMMARY:  
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has emphasized that President Trump's actions, including pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, constitute a moral failing, as Trump allegedly prioritized personal gain over the national interest. Democrats argue that Trump's conduct, including withholding military aid from Ukraine as leverage, violates the Constitution and his oath to serve the country first. Republicans counter that Trump's actions, while unconventional, do not meet the threshold for impeachment, and that investigating Hunter Biden was legitimate. Key evidence includes a phone call where Trump pressed Ukraine's president for an investigation, a whistleblower complaint alleging abuse of power, and testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who claimed Trump wanted a "quid pro quo" but later denied it. The case hinges on whether Trump's actions constitute bribery or extortion, with Democrats framing it as a threat to democratic institutions. Republicans maintain that Trump's actions were not criminal and that Democrats are pursuing a partisan agenda. The committee is expected to draft articles of impeachment, focusing on abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of Congress.
