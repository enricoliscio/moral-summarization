SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, as the committee prepares to write articles of impeachment. Nadler stated that the impeachment process is a serious undertaking to address threats to America's institutions. The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. The case stems from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as Ukraine's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. The key evidence is a phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump asked for a "favor." Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans deny any criminality and defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. The most significant testimony came from Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Ukraine's president in exchange for investigations. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment process as a partisan "sham."
END OF SUMMARY.
