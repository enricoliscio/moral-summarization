SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler emphasized that the Constitution and Trump's oath of office require the president to put the country first. The impeachment case against Trump stems from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he asked for an investigation into political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue that Trump's actions constitute abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Republicans claim that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. Nadler called the impeachment process a "solemn and serious undertaking" to address threats to America's institutions, such as "free and fair elections." The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump.
