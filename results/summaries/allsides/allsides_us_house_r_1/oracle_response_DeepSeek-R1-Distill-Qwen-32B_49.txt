Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided specific morally framed words: use, gain, put, sham, corruption, subscribes. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against Trump. Nadler is emphasizing that Trump put himself before the country, using his office for private gain. The key charges are abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, all tied to Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. So, I'll mention how Trump "put himself before the country" and "used his public office for private gain." The term "sham" is used by Trump to describe the impeachment process, so I'll include that. The article talks about corruption in Ukraine, especially regarding Hunter Biden's job and the Bidens' influence, so I'll mention "corruption." Lastly, Trump "subscribes" to the theory about the server ending up in Ukraine.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main charge, then explain the context with the phone call and military aid. I'll mention the Democrats' arguments and the Republicans' counterpoints, including the use of morally framed words. I'll conclude with Trump's denials and the theory about the server.

Let me put this together, ensuring each morally framed word is included and the summary flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing as requested.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler emphasized that President Trump "put himself before the country" by "using his public office for private gain," a central moral argument in the impeachment case. The charges include abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue Trump engaged in a "quid pro quo" scheme, withholding military aid as leverage, while Republicans claim his actions were unconventional but not criminal. The evidence includes a whistleblower complaint and testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who offered a "quid pro quo" for a White House visit. Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the impeachment process a "sham." The case highlights "corruption" allegations involving Hunter Biden's role at Burisma and the elder Biden's influence in Ukraine. Trump also sought an investigation into a hacked DNC server, subscribing to the theory that it ended up in Ukraine. The committee will proceed to draft articles of impeachment, framing the process as a "solemn and serious" duty to uphold democratic institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
