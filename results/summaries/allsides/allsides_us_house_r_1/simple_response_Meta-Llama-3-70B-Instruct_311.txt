SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler argued that President Trump prioritized his personal interests over the country's well-being, violating his oath of office. Nadler emphasized that no public official, especially the President, should use their position for private gain. The impeachment case against Trump stems from his request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, which Democrats see as an abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of the congressional probe. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross into criminality. However, Nadler stressed that the Constitution and Trump's oath of office require the President to put the country first. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, citing serious threats to America's institutions, including free and fair elections.
