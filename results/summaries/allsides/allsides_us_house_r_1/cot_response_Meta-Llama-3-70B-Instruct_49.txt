SUMMARY:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, violating his oath of office and promise to American citizens. Nadler called the impeachment process a "solemn and serious undertaking" to address "serious threats" to America's institutions, such as "free and fair elections." The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, including charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Republicans argue that Mr. Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Democrats believe that the president engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment. The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a "favor" in investigating the Bidens and Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election.
