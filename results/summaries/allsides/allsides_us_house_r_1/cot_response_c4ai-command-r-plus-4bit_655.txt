SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler described the impeachment process as a "solemn and serious" undertaking, addressing threats to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections. He asserted that no public official, especially the president, should use their position for personal benefit. Nadler accused Trump of putting himself before the country, contrary to the Constitution and his oath of office. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment drive a partisan "sham." The impeachment articles are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. Republicans defend Trump's actions as unconventional but not criminal, and they justify the investigation into Hunter Biden's lucrative role in a Ukrainian company. The case centers on Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Biden and alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. The "quid pro quo" allegation is key to the Democrats' bribery or extortion scheme argument. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the EU, testified about a presumed quid pro quo offer for a White House visit. Trump denied this, and no witness linked military aid to the investigations. Trump maintains his request was about addressing corruption, including Biden's role in forcing out a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board. Trump also wanted Ukraine to investigate an unsubstantiated theory about a missing DNC server. END OF SUMMARY.
