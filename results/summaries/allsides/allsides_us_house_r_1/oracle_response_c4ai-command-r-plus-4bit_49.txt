SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler has argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, specifically in his dealings with Ukraine. Nadler stated that Trump's actions pose a serious threat to America's institutions, including free and fair elections. The impeachment case centers around Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joseph R. Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine. Despite Trump's denial of any wrongdoing, Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme by withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage. The key witness, Gordon Sondland, testified that he offered a quid pro quo arrangement, although Trump denied any such deal. The investigation also revealed possible corruption involving Biden and his son, as well as Trump's unsubstantiated beliefs about a missing DNC server in Ukraine. Nadler emphasized the solemnity of the impeachment process, stating that no president should put himself before the country.
