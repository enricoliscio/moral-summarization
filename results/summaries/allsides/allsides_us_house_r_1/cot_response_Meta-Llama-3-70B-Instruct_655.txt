SUMMARY:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler called the impeachment process a "solemn and serious undertaking" to address threats to America's institutions, such as "free and fair elections." Trump has denied wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment drive as a partisan "sham." The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe, stemming from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue that Trump's action, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment. The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, including testimony from Gordon Sondland, who said he offered a quid pro quo of a prized White House visit for the investigations.
