Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against President Trump. The user has specified that the summary should be under 200 words and follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. It's about Chairman Nadler making arguments for impeachment, the charges related to Ukraine, Trump's denials, Republican arguments, and key evidence like the phone call and the quid pro quo issue. 

I should start by mentioning Nadler's stance and the charges. Then, outline the Democrats' case involving the July phone call and the military aid hold-up. Include the Republicans' counterarguments, such as the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden. Highlight the key witness, Gordon Sondland, and his testimony about the quid pro quo. Also, note that no witness linked the aid hold-up directly to the investigations. 

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the essential elements without getting bogged down in details. Make sure to mention Trump's denials and the expected charges. 

Now, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Nadler's statements, moving to the charges, the evidence, Republican arguments, and the ongoing process. 

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me draft it and then edit for brevity and clarity. Make sure to include all key points without exceeding the limit. 

Double-check that all important aspects are covered: impeachment process, charges, evidence, Republican counterpoints, and the current status of the investigation. 

Okay, I think I have a clear structure. Time to write the summary concisely.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions, including pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, constitute a breach of his constitutional duty to prioritize the country over personal gain. Democrats argue this amounts to abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of Congress, warranting impeachment. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the process a partisan "sham." Republicans counter that Trump's actions, though unconventional, do not cross into criminality and that investigating Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine's energy sector was legitimate. Key evidence includes a July phone call where Trump sought a "favor" from Ukraine's president, with a whistleblower accusing Trump of withholding military aid as leverage. A rough transcript did not show a direct quid pro quo, but Democrats argue the pressure campaign implied one. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that Trump denied any quid pro quo, though he offered a White House visit as an incentive. No witness linked the aid delay to the investigations. Trump has acknowledged wanting the Biden investigation but denies wrongdoing. The case hinges on whether Trump's actions meet the threshold for impeachment. END OF SUMMARY.
