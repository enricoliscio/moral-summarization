SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has outlined the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president prioritized his personal interests over the country's. Nadler stated that the committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment based on the evidence presented. The articles are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. The impeachment case centers around a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed for an investigation into the Bidens and Ukraine's meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans claim that the evidence does not support these claims.
