Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The key points are that the House Judiciary Committee is proceeding with impeachment articles, focusing on abuse of power and bribery, stemming from Trump's dealings with Ukraine. 

The user specifically mentioned that I need to preserve the moral framing from the article. They highlighted certain words like "use," "gain," "put," "sham," "corruption," and "subscribes." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Nadler's arguments, the charges against Trump, the Republican counterarguments, and the evidence presented, including the phone call and the testimony of Sondland. The moral framing here is about Trump putting himself before the country, using his office for personal gain, and the implications of corruption and obstruction of justice.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should start by identifying the key events and the moral implications. I'll mention Nadler's statements about the president putting himself first and using his office for private gain. Then, I'll outline the charges: abuse of power, bribery, obstruction. I should include the Republican arguments about the action being unconventional but not criminal, and the context of Hunter Biden's job. 

I also need to touch on the quid pro quo aspect, Sondland's testimony, and the delayed military aid. It's important to note the moral terms like "sham" and "corruption." I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from the committee's stance, moving to the charges, Republican counterpoints, and the evidence presented.

I'll make sure to include all the morally framed words: "use," "gain," "put," "sham," "corruption," and "subscribes." I'll structure the summary to highlight the ethical concerns, emphasizing Trump's actions as a threat to democratic institutions and the rule of law.

Finally, I'll keep the language concise and within the word limit, ensuring that each sentence contributes to the moral framing without unnecessary details. I'll avoid technical jargon to keep it accessible while maintaining the essential moral arguments from the article.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump’s actions, including using his office for private gain and putting himself before the country, justify impeachment. The committee is preparing articles of impeachment, alleging abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue Trump’s actions, though unconventional, do not cross into criminality, and they defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden’s ties to Ukraine’s energy sector. A whistleblower accused Trump of withholding military aid as leverage, but the White House denied a direct quid pro quo deal. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that Trump claimed there was no quid pro quo, though he presumed it was Trump’s intent. The delay in military aid coincided with the whistleblower complaint. Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the impeachment process a partisan "sham." The case highlights concerns about corruption, abuse of power, and threats to democratic institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
