SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, as the committee prepares to write articles of impeachment. Nadler stated that the impeachment process is a serious undertaking to address threats to America's institutions. The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Republicans have defended Trump's actions and argued for the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's involvement with a Ukrainian natural gas company. The impeachment case centers around a July 25 phone call where Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a "favor", with a whistleblower accusing Trump of abusing his power. Key witnesses, such as Gordon Sondland, have testified about a quid pro quo offer, although no direct evidence has been presented. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment process as a partisan "sham". The articles of impeachment will be based on evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee's inquiry and presented in public hearings.
END OF SUMMARY.
