SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain, as the committee prepares to write articles of impeachment. Nadler stated that the process is a serious undertaking to address threats to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections. The impeachment case stems from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter, as well as Ukraine's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. The case centers around a phone call in which Trump allegedly withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage for the investigations. The Democrats argue that this constitutes bribery or extortion and warrants impeachment. Republicans, however, deny any criminality and defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's involvement with a Ukrainian natural gas company. The most powerful testimony came from Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Ukraine's president in exchange for the investigations. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment drive as a partisan sham. 

END OF SUMMARY.
