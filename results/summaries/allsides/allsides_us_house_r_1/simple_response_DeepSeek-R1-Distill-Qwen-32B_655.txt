Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Chairman Nadler's statements, the charges against Trump, Republican arguments, and the evidence presented, including the phone call with Ukraine's president, the whistleblower, and the role of Giuliani. There's also mention of Hunter Biden's job and the server investigation.

I need to capture the moral aspects. Nadler emphasizes that Trump put himself before the country, which is a key moral point. The Democrats argue that Trump used his office for personal gain, which is a moral failing. On the other side, Republicans counter that Trump's actions, while unconventional, don't meet the threshold for criminality or impeachment.

I should structure the summary to include both perspectives but focus on the moral framing. I'll mention the charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. It's important to note the evidence, like the phone call and the whistleblower, as they highlight the moral issues. Also, the Republican arguments about the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden and the lack of direct evidence linking the military aid hold-up to the investigations should be included to present a balanced view.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start with Nadler's statement, outline the charges, mention the key evidence, and then present the Republican counterarguments. I'll end by noting that the committee is proceeding with drafting articles of impeachment.

Let me make sure I don't include unnecessary details. Focus on the moral implications: Trump's self-interest versus the national interest, the use of public office for private gain, and the threat to democratic institutions. Also, highlight the Republicans' defense that there's no clear evidence of criminality.

I should avoid taking sides but present both viewpoints as they're framed morally in the article. The summary should reflect that the Democrats see it as a moral failing, while Republicans argue it's not crossing the line into impeachment-worthy offenses.

I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions reflect a prioritization of self-interest over the nation, arguing that no public official, especially the president, should exploit their position for personal gain. The committee is preparing articles of impeachment, citing charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue Trump withheld military aid as leverage, constituting a quid pro quo scheme, while Republicans counter that his actions, though unconventional, do not meet the threshold for criminality. Key evidence includes a phone call where Trump pressed Ukraine's president for investigations, a whistleblower's accusation of abuse of power, and testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who claimed he offered a White House visit as leverage. Republicans also defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine's energy sector. Despite the release of military aid before the whistleblower complaint became public, Democrats maintain Trump's actions threaten democratic institutions. The committee proceeds with drafting impeachment articles, highlighting the moral imperative to uphold constitutional standards and prevent self-serving conduct in office. END OF SUMMARY.
