SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump prioritized his personal interests over the country's well-being, violating his oath of office. Nadler argued that the evidence presented demonstrates Trump's abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, with Trump withholding $391 million in military aid as leverage. Democrats argue that Trump's actions constitute a quid pro quo, while Republicans claim it did not cross the line into criminality. Nadler stressed that the Constitution requires the president to put the country first, and that Trump's actions pose a serious threat to America's institutions, including free and fair elections. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump.
