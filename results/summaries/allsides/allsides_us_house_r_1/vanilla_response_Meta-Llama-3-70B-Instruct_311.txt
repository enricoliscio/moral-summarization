SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has outlined the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump, arguing that the president prioritized his personal interests over the country's. Nadler stated that the evidence presented shows Trump abused his power, engaged in bribery, and obstructed the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call where Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue that Trump withheld $391 million in military aid as leverage, while Republicans claim Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee, including testimony from Gordon Sondland, who said he offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for the investigations. Trump has denied wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment drive as a partisan "sham."
