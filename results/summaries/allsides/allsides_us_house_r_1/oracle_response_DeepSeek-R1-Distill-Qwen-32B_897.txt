Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. The key terms to include are "use," "gain," "put," "sham," "corruption," and "subscribes." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against Trump, focusing on his actions regarding Ukraine. The key moral issues are Trump using his office for personal gain, putting himself before the country, and the corruption allegations tied to Hunter Biden.

I should structure the summary to highlight these moral points. Start by mentioning Nadler's argument that Trump used his office for private gain, emphasizing that the president should put the country first. Then, outline the charges: abuse of power, bribery, obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate Biden. 

Include the Republican perspective, arguing that Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal, and their stance on the legitimacy of the Biden investigation. Mention the whistleblower's complaint about withholding military aid as leverage, and the Democrats' argument about the quid pro quo, even though the transcript didn't show it explicitly.

Also, note the testimony from Ambassador Sondland about offering a White House visit in exchange for the investigation, but Trump denying any quid pro quo. Highlight the lack of direct link between aid delay and investigations, and the Democrats' focus on corruption and Trump's unsubstantiated server theory.

Finally, wrap it up by noting that Republicans see this as a partisan sham, while Democrats argue it's a threat to institutions. Make sure to use all the moral terms specified and keep the summary under 200 words.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump used his public office for private gain, arguing that no president should put themselves before the country. The committee is proceeding with articles of impeachment, including charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross into criminality and question the legitimacy of the impeachment process, calling it a partisan "sham." The case centers on a July phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine's president for investigations, with a whistleblower accusing him of withholding military aid as leverage. Democrats argue this constitutes a quid pro quo, while Republicans deny any wrongdoing. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified about offering a White House visit in exchange for the investigations, but Trump denied any quid pro quo. The delay in military aid was not directly linked to the investigations, and Democrats highlight corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden's role at Burisma and Trump's unsubstantiated claims about a missing DNC server. Republicans argue the case is politically motivated, while Democrats frame it as a threat to American institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
