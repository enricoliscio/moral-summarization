SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler has accused President Trump of putting himself before the country, arguing that the president used his public office for private gain. Nadler stated that the impeachment process is a serious undertaking to address threats to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections. The articles of impeachment are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. The case stems from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, with Democrats arguing that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme. Key testimony came from Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in exchange for investigations. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment process as a partisan sham. The impeachment case centers around a phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky for a favor, with a whistleblower accusing the president of abusing his power. The evidence review includes testimony from multiple witnesses and a rough transcript of the call. The case also involves Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate a missing DNC server. Nadler emphasized the moral obligation of the president to put the country first, highlighting the potential damage to America's democratic institutions.
END OF SUMMARY.
