Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words like "use," "gain," "put," "sham," "corruption," and "subscribes." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against Trump. The key issues are Trump using his office for private gain, putting himself before the country, and the charges of abuse of power and bribery.

I should start by mentioning Nadler's statement about the president putting himself before the country. That's a strong moral point. Then, I'll include the charges like abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. The Ukraine investigation involving Hunter Biden is crucial, so I'll note that as part of the evidence.

The article also talks about Republicans defending Trump's actions as unconventional but not criminal. I need to mention their stance. The quid pro quo aspect is central, so I'll explain that Trump withheld military aid as leverage, even though transcripts didn't show a direct deal.

Witnesses like Gordon Sondland are important. He offered a quid pro quo, but Trump denied it. I'll include that to show the conflicting testimonies. The delay in military aid until after the whistleblower complaint is another key point, highlighting the timing and possible motive.

Finally, I'll touch on Trump's unsubstantiated theory about the DNC server in Ukraine, which adds to the corruption narrative. I need to make sure all these points are concise, within 200 words, and include the specified moral words.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: starting with the charges, the Ukraine investigation, Republican arguments, the quid pro quo, witness testimonies, military aid delay, and the server theory. Keeping it clear and focused on the moral aspects without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions, including using his office for private gain, put himself before the country, violating his oath to prioritize the nation. The committee is proceeding with impeachment articles alleging abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue Trump's actions, though unconventional, do not constitute criminality. The case centers on a July phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine President Zelensky for investigations, with a whistleblower accusing Trump of withholding military aid as leverage. Democrats argue this constitutes a quid pro quo, while Republicans contest this narrative. Witnesses, including Ambassador Gordon Sondland, provided conflicting testimonies, with Sondland claiming Trump denied a quid pro quo. The delay in military aid until after the whistleblower complaint raised concerns. Trump has acknowledged seeking investigations into Biden and the DNC server, which Republicans defend as legitimate. The case highlights tensions over corruption, public office use, and the integrity of free elections. END OF SUMMARY.
