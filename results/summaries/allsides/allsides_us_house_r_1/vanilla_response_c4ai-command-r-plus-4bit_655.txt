SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler presented the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump, accusing him of putting himself before the country and using his office for personal gain. Nadler argued that Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and that this request constituted bribery and obstruction of Congress. The case stems from a phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a "favor," and a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump withheld military aid as leverage. While Trump denied wrongdoing, Democrats claim the threat was understood and part of a shadow foreign policy conducted by Trump's lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. The key witness, Gordon Sondland, testified about a quid pro quo offer of a White House visit in exchange for investigations, though Trump denied this. The impeachment inquiry also revealed Trump's interest in a missing DNC server, which he believes ended up in Ukraine. The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee to draft articles of impeachment.
END OF SUMMARY.
