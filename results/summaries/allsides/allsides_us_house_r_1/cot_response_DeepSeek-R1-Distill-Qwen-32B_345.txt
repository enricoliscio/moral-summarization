Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about the House Judiciary Committee and their impeachment case against Trump. Words like "impeachment," "abuse of power," "bribery," "obstructing," "private gain," "public office," "shadow foreign policy," "extortion," "quid pro quo," "corruption," "fraud," and "partisan" stand out as having moral connotations. These words are used to frame the actions of Trump and his associates in a negative light, emphasizing wrongdoing and ethical violations.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping these moral terms. The key points are Nadler's arguments, the charges against Trump, the Republican counterarguments, the evidence from the phone call and Sondland's testimony, and the context of Biden's involvement. I should make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

I'll start by stating the main action: Nadler leading the impeachment case. Then outline the charges: abuse of power, bribery, obstruction. Mention the evidence from the phone call and military aid withholding. Include Sondland's testimony and the lack of direct link from witnesses. Note the Republican defense and the context of Biden's job and Ukraine's corruption. Conclude with the ongoing process and Trump's denial.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covers all key points, and uses the identified moral terms. Let me piece it together, keeping an eye on the word count to stay under 200.

**SUMMARY:**  
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized the moral imperative of holding President Trump accountable, stating that no public official, especially the president, should use their office for private gain. The committee is proceeding with articles of impeachment, citing charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue Trump engaged in a "shadow" foreign policy, using quid pro quo deals, including withholding military aid, to pressure Ukraine. Republicans counter that Trump's actions, while unconventional, do not constitute criminality. Key evidence includes a phone call where Trump pressed Ukraine's president for investigations, and Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony about offering a White House visit as leverage. No witness directly linked the aid holdup to the investigations. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the impeachment a partisan "sham." The case also involves Hunter Biden's lucrative job at Burisma, a company under scrutiny for corruption, and Trump's unsubstantiated claims about a missing DNC server in Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry highlights concerns about threats to free and fair elections and the integrity of U.S. institutions.
