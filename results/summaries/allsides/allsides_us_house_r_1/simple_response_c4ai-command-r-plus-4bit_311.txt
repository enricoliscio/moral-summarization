SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler on Monday made a strong moral case for Democrats' impeachment of President Trump, arguing that the president put his personal interests ahead of the country's. Nadler asserted that no public official, especially the president, should use their office for private gain and that the president's oath of office requires him to put the country first. The impeachment case centers on Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter, despite no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. The Democrats argue that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme by withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage, which Republicans deny. The key witness, Gordon Sondland, testified that he offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Ukraine's president in exchange for investigations. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the impeachment process as a partisan "sham." The impeachment articles are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. Nadler emphasized the seriousness of the process, stating that it is necessary to address threats to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
