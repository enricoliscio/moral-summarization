SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler emphasized that no public official, especially the President, should prioritize personal interests over the country's well-being. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, citing abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Democrats contend that Trump's pressure campaign, including withholding $391 million in military aid, constitutes a quid pro quo deal that warrants impeachment. The inquiry has uncovered evidence of corruption, with Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, conducting a "shadow" foreign policy. Trump's actions have been denounced as a sham, and his refusal to prioritize the country's interests over his own is a serious threat to America's institutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
