Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The key points are that Democrats argue Trump put his interests before the country, using his office for private gain, specifically in the Ukraine investigation. They mention charges like abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress. Republicans counter that Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal. The summary should highlight the moral issues, such as Trump's self-interest and the constitutional duty to prioritize the country. I should include the main elements: the charges, the evidence from the phone call and Sondland's testimony, the withheld military aid, and the Republican arguments. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump's actions in seeking a political favor from Ukraine, including withholding military aid, constitute a breach of his constitutional duty to prioritize the country over personal interests. Democrats argue that Trump's conduct, involving the investigation of political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, amounts to abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction of Congress. Republicans counter that Trump's actions, though unconventional, do not meet the threshold for criminality. Key evidence includes a phone call where Trump pressed Ukraine's president for investigations, and testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo for a White House visit. Despite no direct link between the aid delay and investigations, Democrats maintain the case centers on Trump's misuse of power. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the impeachment process a partisan "sham." The moral framing underscores the conflict between Trump's self-interest and the constitutional requirement for a president to act in the country's best interest. END OF SUMMARY.
