SUMMARY:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country and used his public office for private gain. Nadler described the impeachment process as a "solemn and serious" undertaking, necessary to address threats to America's institutions, such as "free and fair elections." He accused Trump of removing his "blinders" and putting himself before the country, in violation of his oath of office and promise to American citizens. The impeachment case centers around Trump's phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested a "favor" to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had a lucrative role in a Ukrainian company. The Democrats argue that Trump engaged in bribery or extortion, with the "quid pro quo" of withholding military aid as leverage. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he offered a White House visit in exchange for investigations but that Trump denied any quid pro quo. The Republicans defend Trump's actions as unconventional but not criminal, emphasizing the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's role in Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry also includes Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate a missing DNC server, which he believes ended up in Ukraine. The case highlights Trump's alleged abuse of power and potential obstruction of the congressional probe. Nadler's committee will now write articles of impeachment, with charges expected to include abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction.
