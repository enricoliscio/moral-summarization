SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump prioritized personal gain over the country's interests, violating his oath of office. The committee will proceed with writing articles of impeachment against Trump, citing abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from Trump's request to Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, which Democrats argue is a quid pro quo deal. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Nadler stressed that the Constitution requires the president to put the country first, not personal interests. The committee is reviewing evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee, including testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who said he offered a quid pro quo deal for Ukraine investigations. The moral imperative is clear: no public official, especially the president, should use their office for personal gain.

END OF SUMMARY.
