SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has concluded that President Trump put his personal interests above the country's, arguing that no public official should use their office for private gain. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Trump, citing evidence of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. The impeachment case stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. Democrats claim that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme that warrants impeachment. The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence gathered by the Intelligence Committee, including testimony from EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who said he offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for the investigations.
