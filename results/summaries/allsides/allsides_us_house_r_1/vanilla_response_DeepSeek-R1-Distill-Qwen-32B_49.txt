Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment case against President Trump. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts with Jerrold Nadler, the chairman, stating that the president shouldn't use his office for personal gain. The committee is moving to draft articles of impeachment, which include abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress. These charges stem from Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

Republicans argue that Trump's actions, while unconventional, aren't criminal. They also defend the legitimacy of investigating Hunter Biden's job at Burisma. The key point is the July 25 phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine's president. A whistleblower accused Trump of withholding military aid as leverage, which is seen as a quid pro quo.

The article mentions that the released transcript didn't show a direct quid pro quo, but Democrats argue it was implied. Ambassador Sondland testified about offering a White House visit in exchange for investigations, but Trump denied it. No witness linked the aid holdup to the investigations, and the aid was released after the whistleblower complaint was made public.

Trump wanted an investigation into Biden and the DNC server, which disappeared before the FBI could examine it. Republicans support Trump, while Democrats push for impeachment.

So, the summary should include the main points: Nadler's statements, the charges, the Ukraine call, the whistleblower, quid pro quo, Sondland's testimony, the aid release, and the DNC server. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me structure it: start with Nadler's position, mention the charges, the Ukraine call and its implications, the quid pro quo issue, Sondland's testimony, the aid timeline, and the DNC server. Also, note the Republican and Democratic stances.

I should ensure clarity and avoid getting bogged down in too many details. Make sure each sentence covers a key point without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump prioritized personal gain over the nation, asserting that public officials, especially the president, must act in the country's best interest. The committee is preparing articles of impeachment, focusing on charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing Congress, stemming from Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue Trump's actions were unconventional but not criminal, defending the investigation into Hunter Biden's role at Burisma. The key issue centers on a July 25 phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine's president for investigations, with a whistleblower alleging Trump withheld military aid as leverage. While a transcript didn't show a direct quid pro quo, Democrats argue it was implied. Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified about offering a White House visit in exchange for investigations, but Trump denied any such arrangement. No witness directly linked the aid holdup to the investigations, which were eventually released after the whistleblower complaint was made public. Trump also sought an investigation into a missing DNC server hacked by Russia. Republicans support Trump, while Democrats push for impeachment. END OF SUMMARY.
