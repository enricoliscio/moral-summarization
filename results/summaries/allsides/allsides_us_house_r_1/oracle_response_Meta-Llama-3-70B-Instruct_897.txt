SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler argued that this is a serious threat to America's institutions, particularly free and fair elections. The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, citing evidence of abuse of power, bribery, and obstructing the congressional probe. Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. However, Democrats contend that Trump engaged in a bribery or extortion scheme, pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter. The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a "favor" in investigating the Bidens, withholding $391 million of U.S. military aid as leverage. Trump has denied wrongdoing, denouncing the House impeachment drive as a partisan "sham."

END OF SUMMARY.
