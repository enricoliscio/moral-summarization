SUMMARY:

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler emphasized that President Trump put himself before the country, using his public office for private gain. Nadler argued that the Constitution and the president's oath of office require the president to put the country first, not engage in a "sham" for personal benefit. The impeachment case stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he pressed for an investigation into political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, withholding $391 million in military aid as leverage. Democrats argue this constitutes a bribery or extortion scheme, while Republicans claim Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. The Judiciary Committee is reviewing evidence, including testimony from Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for the investigations. Trump has denied wrongdoing, but his actions are seen as a serious threat to America's institutions, including free and fair elections, and are tainted by corruption.
