SUMMARY:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler argued that President Trump put himself before the country, engaging in "wrongdoing" and "abuse of power" for "personal gain". Nadler stated that no public official, especially the President, should use their office for "private gain". The committee will proceed to write articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, citing charges of "bribery", "obstructing" the congressional probe, and "abuse of power". Republicans argue that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into "criminality". The impeachment case stems from a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for a "favor" in investigating the Bidens and Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election.
