SUMMARY:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that President Trump put himself before the country, violating his oath of office and promise to American citizens. Nadler argued that no public official, especially the president, should use their public office for personal gain, and that Trump's actions constitute a "solemn and serious" threat to America's institutions, including free and fair elections. The impeachment case against Trump stems from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed for a "favor" in investigating political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats argue that Trump's actions amount to abuse of power, bribery, and extortion, warranting impeachment. Republicans, however, claim that Trump's actions, though unconventional, did not cross the line into criminality. END OF SUMMARY.
