SUMMARY: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler accused President Trump of putting himself before the country in the Democrats' impeachment case, arguing that no public official should use their office for private gain. Nadler emphasized the seriousness of the impeachment process and appealed to Republicans to recognize the threat to America's institutions, such as free and fair elections. He asserted that Trump's actions, including asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter, put himself before the country's interests. The case centers on a phone call where Trump requested Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. A whistleblower accused Trump of abusing his power and withholding military aid as leverage. While Trump denied wrongdoing, Democrats argue that he engaged in bribery or extortion, with key testimony coming from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who offered a quid pro quo of a White House visit for Zelensky in exchange for investigations. The impeachment articles are expected to include charges of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction. Nadler's statement underscores the moral obligation of public officials to prioritize the country's interests over personal gain.
