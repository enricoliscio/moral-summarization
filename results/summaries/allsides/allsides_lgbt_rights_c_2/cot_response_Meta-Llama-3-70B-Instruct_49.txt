SUMMARY:
The Republican party has adopted a platform that is being called the most anti-LGBT in party history, despite having a candidate, Donald Trump, who claims to be a "friend of the gay community." Trump's speech at the GOP convention emphasized protecting LGBTQ citizens from "hateful foreign ideology," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, holds "extreme" views on LGBT rights, having spoken out against equal rights for LGBT people and calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Meanwhile, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the convention, saying he's "proud to be gay" and "proud to be a Republican," but criticized the debate over transgender bathroom rights as a "distraction" from real problems.
