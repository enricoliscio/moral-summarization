Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it again to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Republican Party adopting a very anti-LGBT platform, according to the Log Cabin Republicans. But some pro-LGBT Republicans see Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, gave a speech at the GOP convention. He said he's proud to be gay and a Republican, but didn't fully support the party's platform. He criticized the focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction.

Trump claims to be a friend of the gay community, but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, and mandates bathroom use based on birth certificates. Trump hasn't been clear on his stance, only mentioning support during the convention. He has gay friends like Elton John but supports the First Amendment Defense Act and opposes federal same-sex marriage support.

Mike Pence, Trump's VP pick, has extreme anti-LGBT views, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a sign of societal collapse.

So, the moral framing here is about the conflict between individual support for the LGBT community and the party's platform. It's about how some individuals in the GOP support LGBT rights, but the party's policies are against them. The summary should highlight this tension, Thiel's speech, Trump's ambiguous support, and Pence's extreme views.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral dilemma between personal support and party policy.

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, speaking at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican, while criticizing the party's focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction. Trump has claimed to be a "friend of the gay community," though his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and mandates transgender bathroom use based on birth certificates. Trump's support for LGBT rights remains unclear, with his only mention during the convention being a vague pledge to protect LGBTQ citizens. While he has gay friends, like Elton John, he supports the First Amendment Defense Act and opposes federal same-sex marriage support. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, has been criticized for his extreme anti-LGBT views, including opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a sign of societal collapse. The summary highlights the moral tension between individual support for LGBT rights and the GOP's anti-LGBT platform. END OF SUMMARY.
