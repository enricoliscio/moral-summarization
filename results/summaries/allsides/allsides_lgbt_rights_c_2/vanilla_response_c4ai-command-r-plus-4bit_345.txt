SUMMARY: While the 2016 Republican Party platform is considered the most anti-LGBT in history, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel's speech, however, downplayed the importance of LGBT rights debates, such as the transgender bathroom issue. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" and has many gay friends, but his stance on LGBT rights is unclear. He opposes federal support for same-sex marriage and has criticized transgender bathroom debates. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views, once calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Despite this, some LGBT Republicans feel represented by Thiel's presence at the convention and view Trump as a potential ally. 

END OF SUMMARY.
