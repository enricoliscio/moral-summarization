SUMMARY:
The Republican party has adopted its most anti-LGBT platform in history, sparking controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a proud gay man, spoke at the GOP convention, acknowledging the party's platform but calling the transgender bathroom debate a "distraction" from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy." Trump has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which would provide broad protection to individuals and businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, having opposed equal rights for LGBT people and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." END OF SUMMARY.
