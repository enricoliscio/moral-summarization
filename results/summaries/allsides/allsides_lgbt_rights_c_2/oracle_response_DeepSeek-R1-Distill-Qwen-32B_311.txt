Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article discusses the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, highlighting that the party has an anti-LGBT platform. Some pro-LGBT Republicans see Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, gave a speech at the GOP convention. He expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform, calling the transgender bathroom debate a distraction.

The Republican platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, and mandates transgender people use bathrooms based on birth certificates. Trump claims to be a friend of the LGBT community but hasn't been clear on his stance. He mentioned protecting LGBTQ citizens from violence and oppression but didn't address other issues during the convention. He supports letting states decide on same-sex marriage and the First Amendment Defense Act.

Mike Pence, Trump's VP pick, has extreme views against LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and supporting traditional marriage. The author uses words like "opposes," "supports," "protect," "violence," "oppression," etc., which I need to include in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflicting views within the GOP, Thiel's criticism, the platform's specifics, Trump's ambiguous support, and Pence's extreme stance. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party has adopted a platform that opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, while also mandating transgender individuals use bathrooms based on their birth certificates. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate in GOP history. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform, calling the transgender bathroom debate a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his support is unclear. He supports the First Amendment Defense Act and opposes federal support for same-sex marriage, advocating for states to decide. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been described as having "more extreme" views on LGBT rights than any modern VP nominee, opposing equal rights and supporting traditional marriage. The article highlights the tension between the party's anti-LGBT platform and Trump's claimed support, while emphasizing the moral framing of "opposing," "protecting," and "rights." END OF SUMMARY.
