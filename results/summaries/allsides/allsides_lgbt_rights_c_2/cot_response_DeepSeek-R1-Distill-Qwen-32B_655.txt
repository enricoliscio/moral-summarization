Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again to spot those.

The article talks about the Republican Party's anti-LGBT platform, which is a strong moral stance. Words like "anti-LGBT," "pro-LGBT," "opposes," "conversion therapy," "oppose," "protect," "oppress," "support," "friend," "protect," "oppose," "oppose," "extreme," "opposing," "societal collapse." These words carry moral weight because they relate to rights, discrimination, support, and opposition.

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, Thiel's mixed stance, Trump's unclear position, Pence's extreme views, and the overall tension between personal support and party policy.

I should start by mentioning the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, then Thiel's speech, Trump's support but conflicting party policies, Pence's extreme views, and end with the contrast between personal support and party stance.

Let me structure it step by step. First, introduce the platform. Then, mention Thiel's speech and his criticism. Next, Trump's statements and his unclear position. Then, Pence's extreme views. Finally, the contrast between individuals supporting the community and the party's policies.

I need to make sure to include all the identified moral words without making it too wordy. Let me piece it together.

**Summary:**

The Republican Party has adopted a platform criticized as the most anti-LGBT in history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and enforcing restrictive bathroom laws. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, while proud to be gay and a Republican, criticized the party's focus on transgender bathroom debates, calling it a distraction. Donald Trump claims to be a "friend of the gay community," yet his support is unclear, as he endorses state-level decisions on same-sex marriage and supports the First Amendment Defense Act. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been labeled as having "more extreme" views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and advocating for traditional marriage. Despite individual claims of support, the party's policies reflect a divide between personal acceptance and institutional opposition, highlighting the tension between progressive values and conservative platforms.
