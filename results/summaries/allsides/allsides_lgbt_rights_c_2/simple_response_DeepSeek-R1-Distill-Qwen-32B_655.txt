Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, with some pro-LGBT Republicans supporting Trump despite the party's platform.

First, I'll identify the key points: the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, Peter Thiel's speech at the convention, Trump's mixed signals on support, Pence's extreme views, and the broader debate on transgender rights and bathroom issues.

I should highlight the tension between individual support and party policy. Thiel's speech is important because he's a prominent figure, so I'll mention his pride in being gay and a Republican, but also note his criticism of the platform's focus on bathroom debates as a distraction.

Trump's statements are mixed. He claims to support the LGBTQ community but hasn't clearly backed same-sex marriage or opposed conversion therapy. His support for the First Amendment Defense Act and letting states decide on marriage is a point to include.

Pence's role as VP nominee is crucial because his anti-LGBT stance is more extreme, which contrasts with Trump's somewhat ambiguous position.

I'll structure the summary to show the conflict within the GOP: individuals like Thiel and Trump supporting LGBT rights, but the party's platform and Pence's policies opposing them. The moral framing is the tension between personal support and party policy, the distraction from real issues, and the broader societal debate on equality.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all these elements. Make sure to mention the specific policies like opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and bathroom laws.

Finally, I'll conclude with the ongoing debate and the impact of Pence's nomination on the party's stance.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party's 2016 platform has been criticized for being the most anti-LGBT in history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and backing laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as their most supportive GOP candidate. Thiel, in a convention speech, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction from real issues. Trump has claimed to be a "friend of the gay community," though his support is unclear. He opposes federal recognition of same-sex marriage and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects those opposing same-sex marriage. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been described as having "more extreme" anti-LGBT views than any modern VP nominee, opposing equal rights for LGBT individuals. The article highlights the tension between individual Republican support for LGBT rights and the party's broader anti-LGBT platform, as well as the ongoing debate over equality and discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
