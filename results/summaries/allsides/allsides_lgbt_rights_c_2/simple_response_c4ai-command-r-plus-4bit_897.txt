SUMMARY: While the Republican Party adopts an anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans see Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, saying it was a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" and has many gay friends, but his actions and his party's platform suggest otherwise. The Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and allows businesses and adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT couples. Trump has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports legislation that would protect individuals and businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. His vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views, once calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Despite this, some LGBT Republicans continue to support Trump, highlighting a complex moral dilemma within the party.
