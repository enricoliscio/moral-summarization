SUMMARY:
The Republican party has adopted its most anti-LGBT platform in history, sparking controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a proud gay Republican, spoke at the GOP convention, nodding to both sides. While he didn't agree with every plank in the party's platform, he portrayed the transgender rights debate as a distraction from real problems. Donald Trump, who calls himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy." Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights for LGBT people and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans see Trump as the most supportive candidate in GOP history. END OF SUMMARY.
