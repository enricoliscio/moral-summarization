SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted a platform that is being called the most anti-LGBT in party history, despite some pro-LGBT Republicans claiming Donald Trump is the most supportive candidate in GOP history. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, gave a speech at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay and Republican, but didn't address the party's anti-LGBT platform. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy." Trump's own stance on LGBT issues is unclear, but he has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people, calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite some attempts to appear supportive, the party's platform and Trump's actions suggest a lack of support for LGBT rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
