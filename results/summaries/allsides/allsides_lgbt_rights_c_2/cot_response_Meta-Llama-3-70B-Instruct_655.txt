SUMMARY:
The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, which has sparked controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, gave a speech at the GOP convention, proudly declaring himself gay and Republican, but also downplaying the importance of transgender rights, calling it a "distraction" from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance on LGBT issues, despite his party's platform opposing same-sex marriage and supporting "conversion therapy." Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, having opposed equal rights for LGBT people and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." The party's platform and Trump's ambiguous stance have raised concerns among LGBT advocates. END OF SUMMARY.
