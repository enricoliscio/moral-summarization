Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article discusses the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, highlighting their platform as the most anti-LGBT in history. It mentions Peter Thiel's speech at the GOP convention, where he expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform. Thiel's comments on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction suggest a moral stance against overemphasis on such issues while ignoring bigger problems.

Then, the article talks about Donald Trump's support for the LGBT community, despite the party's platform opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and restrictive bathroom laws. Trump's unclear position is noted, with him emphasizing state-level decisions and supporting the First Amendment Defense Act. His vice president, Mike Pence, is described as having extreme anti-LGBT views, which adds a moral critique of the administration's stance.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the tension between individual support from figures like Thiel and Trump versus the party's platform, which is morally opposed to LGBT rights. The moral framing here is about the conflict between personal support and policy, and the distraction from real issues versus the focus on restrictive laws.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, making sure to include Thiel's speech, Trump's ambiguous support, the party platform's specifics, and Pence's extreme views. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the most impactful details.

Finally, I'll present the summary in a clear, concise manner, ensuring that the moral nuances are preserved. The user wants the summary to reflect the author's original moral framing, so I need to maintain that perspective without adding my own bias.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party has adopted its most anti-LGBT platform in history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and backing laws restricting LGBT rights. Despite this, pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as the most supportive GOP candidate in history. Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform, calling transgender bathroom debates a distraction. Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been vague on his stance, supporting state-level decisions on same-sex marriage and the First Amendment Defense Act, which opposes federal recognition of same-sex unions. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been criticized for extreme anti-LGBT views, including opposing gay marriage and labeling it a sign of "societal collapse." The article highlights the tension between individual support for LGBT rights and the party's restrictive platform, emphasizing the moral conflict between personal pride and policy opposition.
