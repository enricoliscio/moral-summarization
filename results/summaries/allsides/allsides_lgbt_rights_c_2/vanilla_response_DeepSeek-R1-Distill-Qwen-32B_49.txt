Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues and how some pro-LGBT Republicans, including Peter Thiel and Donald Trump, are involved. The article mentions the party's platform opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and other anti-LGBT policies. Thiel's speech at the convention is highlighted, where he expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform. Trump claims to be a friend of the gay community but hasn't been clear on his stance, supporting state-level decisions on same-sex marriage and opposing federal support. His vice president pick, Mike Pence, is described as having extreme views against LGBT rights. I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to cover the key points without getting bogged down in details.
