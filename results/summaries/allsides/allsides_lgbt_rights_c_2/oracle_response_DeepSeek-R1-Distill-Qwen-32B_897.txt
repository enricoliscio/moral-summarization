Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. The article is about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, with some pro-LGBT Republicans supporting Trump despite the party's platform.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The GOP's platform is anti-LGBT, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting conversion therapy. Trump claims to be a friend of the gay community but hasn't been clear on his stance. Peter Thiel, a gay Republican, spoke at the convention, emphasizing American pride but downplaying the transgender bathroom debate as a distraction. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, is very against LGBT rights, which is a strong indicator of their position.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: friend, opposes, supports, refuse, protect, violence, oppression, opposing, rights, collapse. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, using "opposes" and "supports." Then, note Trump's claim as a "friend" but his unclear stance. Thiel's speech, using "proud" and "distraction," but also his acknowledgment of not agreeing with every plank. Trump's support for the First Amendment Defense Act and opposing federal same-sex marriage. Pence's extreme views, leading to societal collapse.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include all key points and the moral words without making it too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party has adopted a platform that opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as a friend of the gay community. Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party’s focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction. Trump has claimed to protect LGBTQ citizens from violence and oppression but has not clearly supported their rights. His stance on same-sex marriage is unclear, and he supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which opposes same-sex marriage. Trump’s vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been described as holding views on LGBT rights that are more extreme than any modern VP nominee, opposing equal rights and equating gay marriage to societal collapse. END OF SUMMARY.
