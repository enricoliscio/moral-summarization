SUMMARY: Despite the Republican Party's anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, stating that it is a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his stance on LGBT rights is unclear, with conflicting statements and actions. The Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and endorses laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals and couples. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views, considering gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse."

END OF SUMMARY.
