SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, claim Donald Trump is the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, said he's proud to be an American and doesn't agree with every plank in the party's platform. He portrayed the transgender rights debate as a distraction from real problems. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and refuses service to LGBT couples. Trump's words on LGBT support are few, and his actions, like supporting the First Amendment Defense Act, suggest otherwise. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." The party's platform and Trump's actions raise concerns about violence, oppression, and refusal to protect LGBT citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
