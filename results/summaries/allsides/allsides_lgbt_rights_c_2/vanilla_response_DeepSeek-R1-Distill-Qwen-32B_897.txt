Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues and Donald Trump's position. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the Republican Party has adopted a platform that the Log Cabin Republicans call the most anti-LGBT in history. However, some pro-LGBT Republicans see Trump as the most supportive candidate in the party's history. Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, gave a speech at the GOP convention where he expressed pride in being gay and a Republican. He criticized the party's platform but downplayed the transgender bathroom debate as a distraction.

Next, the article details the 2016 Republican Platform, which opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, and enforces bathroom laws based on birth certificates. Trump has been inconsistent, supporting LGBTQ citizens but not clearly backing same-sex marriage. He's mentioned the First Amendment Defense Act and letting states decide on marriage issues.

Mike Pence, Trump's VP pick, is strongly against LGBT rights, with Newsom calling his views extreme. The article contrasts Trump's personal friendliness with his party's policies and Pence's stance.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the conflicting positions within the GOP on LGBT issues. Mention Thiel's speech and his criticism of the platform. Highlight the key points of the platform, Trump's mixed signals, and Pence's extreme views. Conclude by noting the contrast between Trump's personal stance and the party's policies.

Let me structure this: introduce the divide, Thiel's speech, the platform details, Trump's support and contradictions, Pence's role, and the overall conflict. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear without getting too detailed.

I should avoid jargon and keep sentences straightforward. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically from one point to the next, ending with the main takeaway about the party's stance and Trump's position.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all key points without being too lengthy.
