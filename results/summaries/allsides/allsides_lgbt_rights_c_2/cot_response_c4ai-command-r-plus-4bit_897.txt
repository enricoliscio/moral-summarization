SUMMARY:
The Republican Party's platform has been labeled by the Log Cabin Republicans as the most anti-LGBT in history, with stances opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and endorsing discriminatory laws against LGBT couples and transgender individuals. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate ever. Peter Thiel, in his GOP convention speech, declared his pride in being gay and Republican but downplayed the importance of the transgender bathroom debate, calling it a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend" of the gay community and highlighted his gay acquaintances, yet his actions and words suggest ambiguity on LGBT issues. He has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports laws that go against federal support for same-sex marriage. The selection of Mike Pence as Trump's vice presidential pick further highlights the conflicting signals, as Pence has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people, deeming gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." The conflicting messages from the Republican Party and Trump's campaign leave questions about their true stance on LGBT rights.
