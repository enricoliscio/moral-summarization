SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted a platform that opposes LGBT rights, sparking controversy among its members. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a gay Republican, spoke at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay and American, but didn't address the party's anti-LGBT stance. Instead, he portrayed the transgender bathroom debate as a distraction from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, despite his party's platform opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and refusing service to LGBT couples. Trump has also criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which would protect individuals and businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." The party's platform and Trump's actions suggest a lack of commitment to protecting LGBT citizens from "violence and oppression."
