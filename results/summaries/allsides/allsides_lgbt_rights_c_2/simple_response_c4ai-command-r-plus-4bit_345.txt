SUMMARY: As the Republican Party adopts the most anti-LGBT platform in its history, some pro-LGBT Republicans are calling Donald Trump their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual identity and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, saying it was a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his actions and those of his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, suggest otherwise. The 2016 Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and endorses laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals and couples. Trump has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports legislation that would protect businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. Pence has a long history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people, once calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Despite this, some LGBT Republicans feel that Trump is their most supportive candidate yet, highlighting the complex interplay between personal beliefs, party politics, and support for marginalized communities in American politics.
