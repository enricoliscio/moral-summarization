Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, specifically their platform and some key figures like Peter Thiel and Donald Trump.

First, I need to identify the key points. The article mentions that the Republican platform is the most anti-LGBT in history, according to Log Cabin Republicans. However, some pro-LGBT Republicans see Trump as the most supportive candidate. Peter Thiel's speech at the GOP convention is highlightedâ€”he's proud to be gay and a Republican but doesn't agree with every party plank. He downplays the transgender bathroom debate as a distraction.

Then, the article details the GOP platform's opposition to same-sex marriage, support for conversion therapy, allowing businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, and requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on birth certificates. Trump's mixed signals: he claims to be a friend of the gay community but hasn't been clear on his stance. He supports letting states decide on same-sex marriage and the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects those opposing same-sex marriage.

Mike Pence's extreme views on LGBT rights are also mentioned, which could indicate Trump's position.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: friend, opposes, supports, refuse, protect, violence, oppression, opposing, rights, collapse. I need to make sure these words are included.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflicting stances within the GOP, Thiel's mixed message, Trump's unclear position, and Pence's extreme views. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included. I'll start by stating the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, mention Thiel's speech, outline the platform's specifics, Trump's mixed signals, and conclude with Pence's role. I'll make sure to use the required moral words naturally within the summary.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party's 2016 platform, criticized as the most anti-LGBT in history, opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Despite this, pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, in a GOP convention speech, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but distanced himself from the party's platform, calling transgender bathroom debates a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" but has not clearly supported LGBT rights, instead emphasizing state-level decisions on same-sex marriage and supporting the First Amendment Defense Act. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been labeled as having "more extreme" views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and describing gay marriage as a sign of "societal collapse." The party's stance on protecting LGBT citizens from violence and oppression remains unclear, with some accusing it of fostering hate through its policies. END OF SUMMARY.
