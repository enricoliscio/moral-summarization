Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the author's moral perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Republican Party's platform on LGBT issues, Peter Thiel's speech, and Donald Trump's stance. The author uses specific morally charged words like "friend," "opposes," "supports," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article contrasts pro-LGBT Republicans supporting Trump with the party's anti-LGBT platform. Thiel's speech is a key point where he acknowledges the platform's issues but downplays the importance of transgender bathroom debates. Trump's statements are mixedâ€”he claims to be a friend but supports policies that many see as anti-LGBT.

I should structure the summary to highlight these contrasts. Start with the party's platform, mention Thiel's speech, then Trump's words versus his policies, and end with Pence's extreme views. I'll use the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure each point is clear but brief. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party has adopted a platform that opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, while also supporting laws on transgender bathroom use. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, proudly identified as gay and a Republican, while acknowledging the party's platform doesn't align with his views. He criticized the focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction from real issues. Trump, who calls himself a "friend of the gay community," has been vague on his stance, supporting the First Amendment Defense Act and opposing federal support for same-sex marriage. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been criticized for extreme opposition to LGBT rights, including opposing gay marriage and labeling it a sign of "societal collapse." The party's platform and actions highlight a tension between rhetoric of "protecting" LGBT citizens and policies that may perpetuate "oppression" and "violence." END OF SUMMARY.
