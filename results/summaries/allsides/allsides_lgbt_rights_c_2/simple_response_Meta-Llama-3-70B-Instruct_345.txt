SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted a platform that is being called the most anti-LGBT in party history, despite some pro-LGBT Republicans, like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, calling Donald Trump the most supportive candidate in the GOP's history. Thiel's speech at the GOP convention nodded to both sides, declaring his pride in being gay and American, while also downplaying the importance of transgender rights. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform suggests otherwise, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting "conversion therapy." Trump's own stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds views on LGBT rights that are considered extreme. The party's platform and Trump's words and actions send a mixed message, leaving many to question his commitment to protecting LGBT citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
