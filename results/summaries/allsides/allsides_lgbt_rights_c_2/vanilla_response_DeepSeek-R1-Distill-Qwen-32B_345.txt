Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues and how some pro-LGBT Republicans are supporting Donald Trump. The article mentions Peter Thiel's speech at the GOP convention, where he talked about being proud to be gay and a Republican, but also criticized the party's platform on LGBT rights. The platform itself is quite anti-LGBT, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and having strict bathroom laws. Trump claims to support the LGBT community but his party's platform seems contradictory. The article also touches on Trump's past statements and his vice president Mike Pence's extreme views. 

I should start by highlighting the main points: the GOP's anti-LGBT platform, Thiel's mixed message, Trump's unclear stance, and Pence's extreme views. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by introducing the conflicting views within the GOP, Thiel's speech, the specifics of the platform, Trump's contradictory statements, and Pence's role. I'll also mention how the party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and the bathroom laws. Finally, I'll note that while Trump claims support, his actions and the platform suggest otherwise, and Pence's extreme views add to the confusion.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party has adopted a platform criticized as the most anti-LGBT in its history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and enforcing strict bathroom laws. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform, calling transgender bathroom debates a distraction. Trump has claimed to be a "friend of the gay community," but his support is unclear. He has criticized transgender bathroom issues and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, opposing federal same-sex marriage support. Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, has been called "more extreme" on LGBT issues, opposing equal rights and supporting traditional marriage. The party's platform and Trump's mixed signals leave LGBT support uncertain within the GOP. END OF SUMMARY.
