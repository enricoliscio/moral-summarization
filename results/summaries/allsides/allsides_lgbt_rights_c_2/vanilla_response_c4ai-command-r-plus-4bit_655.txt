SUMMARY: While the Republican Party's 2016 platform is considered the most anti-LGBT in history, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. At the GOP convention, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel declared his pride in being gay and Republican, but did not directly address the party's anti-LGBT stances. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his actions and words suggest a mixed record on LGBT rights. He opposes federal support for same-sex marriage and has criticized transgender bathroom debates, while also claiming to protect LGBTQ citizens. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, holds extremely conservative views on LGBT rights, once calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." The Republican Party's platform includes opposition to same-sex marriage, support for conversion therapy, and support for laws discriminating against LGBT individuals and couples. Despite this, some Republicans feel Trump is a step forward for LGBT acceptance within the party. 

END OF SUMMARY.
