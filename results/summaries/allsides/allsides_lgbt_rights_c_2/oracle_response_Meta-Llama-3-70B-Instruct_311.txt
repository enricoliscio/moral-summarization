SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, which has sparked controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder, delivered a speech at the GOP convention, proudly declaring his gay identity and Republican affiliation, but also acknowledging the party's stance on LGBT rights. Thiel criticized the transgender bathroom debate, calling it a "distraction" from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, with his party's platform opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and refusing service to LGBT couples. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite Trump's claims to "protect" LGBT citizens from "violence and oppression," his actions and words suggest otherwise.

END OF SUMMARY.
