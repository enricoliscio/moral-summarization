Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues, with some pro-LGBT members supporting Donald Trump. There's a mention of Peter Thiel's speech at the GOP convention, where he talked about being proud to be gay and a Republican, but also criticized the party's platform. 

Hmm, the Republican platform is pretty anti-LGBT, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and restrictive bathroom laws. Trump says he's a friend but his party's platform contradicts that. He mentioned protecting LGBTQ citizens but didn't elaborate much during the convention. 

I should note the contrast between Thiel's support and the party's platform. Also, Trump's unclear position and his VP pick, Mike Pence, who's strongly against LGBT rights. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I need to capture the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with the party's anti-LGBT platform, mention Thiel's speech, Trump's statements, and Pence's stance. Keep it clear and to the point.

Despite this, pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, speaking at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican, while acknowledging disagreements with the party’s platform. Thiel criticized the transgender bathroom debate as a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his support is unclear. He has criticized the bathroom debate and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, opposing federal same-sex marriage support.
