SUMMARY: Despite the Republican Party's adoption of an anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender bathroom rights, stating that it distracts from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his stance on LGBT issues is ambiguous. While he opposes federal support for same-sex marriage and supports laws that allow businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples, he has also spoken out against violence and oppression toward the LGBTQ community. The actions of Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, who has strongly opposed equal rights for LGBT people, may provide a clearer indication of Trump's stance on gay rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
