SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted a platform that is being called the most anti-LGBT in party history, despite some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, calling Donald Trump the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention and expressed pride in being gay and Republican, but also downplayed the importance of transgender rights, calling the debate a "distraction." Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Trump's own stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans are supporting Trump, citing his more accepting stance on gay issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
