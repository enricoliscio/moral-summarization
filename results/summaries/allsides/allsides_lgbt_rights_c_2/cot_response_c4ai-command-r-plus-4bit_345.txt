SUMMARY:
The Republican Party's 2016 platform is considered the most anti-LGBT in history, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting "conversion therapy" and discriminatory laws against LGBT couples and transgender individuals. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate ever. During the GOP convention, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, expressed pride in being a Republican and an American while downplaying LGBT rights debates as distractions. Trump has called himself a "friend" of the gay community and highlighted his gay acquaintances, yet his stance on LGBT issues is unclear. He criticized the transgender bathroom debate and supports laws that would allow discrimination against LGBT couples. Trump's VP pick, Mike Pence, holds extremely anti-LGBT views, considering gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." While Trump claims to protect LGBT citizens from oppression, his actions suggest a conflicting stance on LGBT rights, creating uncertainty about his true position.
