Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. The article discusses the Republican Party's platform, which is described as anti-LGBT. So "anti-LGBT" is a moral term. Then, "pro-LGBT" is another, showing support. The platform opposes same-sex marriage, so "opposes" is a moral action. It supports "conversion therapy," which is a controversial practice. It also supports laws that refuse service to LGBT couples, so "refuse" is a moral choice. Transgender rights are debated, so "transgender" is a group with moral implications. The platform requires using bathrooms based on birth certificates, so "requires" is a policy with moral overtones. Trump calls himself a "friend," which is a positive moral stance. He mentions protecting citizens from "violence" and "oppression," which are negative moral actions. The "hateful foreign ideology" is another negative moral term. The article mentions "conversion therapy" again, so that's another moral word. The First Amendment Defense Act is about "protection," which is a positive moral concept. Trump supports "traditional marriage," a moral value. Pence's views are "extreme," indicating a strong moral stance against LGBT rights. The article also mentions "opposing equal rights," which is a moral action.

Moving on to the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, including as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should highlight the conflict within the Republican Party, the platform's anti-LGBT policies, Thiel's speech, Trump's ambiguous support, Pence's extreme views, and the overall moral debate on LGBT rights.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the conflicting views within the GOP, then detail the platform's policies, mention Thiel's and Trump's statements, and conclude with the implications of Pence's stance. I'll make sure to include words like anti-LGBT, pro-LGBT, opposes, conversion therapy, refuse, transgender, requires, friend, violence, oppression, hateful, conversion therapy again, protection, traditional marriage, extreme, opposing equal rights.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point while preserving the moral framing. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just presenting the facts with the moral terms highlighted.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Republican Party’s 2016 platform has been criticized for being the most anti-LGBT in its history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and backing laws that allow discrimination against LGBT individuals. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, have expressed support for Donald Trump, calling him the most supportive GOP candidate on LGBT issues. Thiel’s speech at the GOP convention acknowledged the party’s platform but criticized the focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction. Trump, while claiming to be a “friend of the gay community,” has been vague on his stance, supporting state-level decisions on same-sex marriage and the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects those opposing same-sex marriage. Trump’s vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been described as holding views on LGBT rights that are more extreme than any modern nominee, having opposed equal rights for LGBT individuals in the past. The article highlights the moral and political conflict within the GOP over LGBT rights.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
