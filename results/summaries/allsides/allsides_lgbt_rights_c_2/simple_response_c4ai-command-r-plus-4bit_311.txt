SUMMARY: As the Republican Party adopts the most anti-LGBT platform in its history, some pro-LGBT Republicans are calling Donald Trump their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual identity and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, saying it was a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" and has many gay friends, but his actions and his party's platform suggest otherwise. The Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses and adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT couples. Trump has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports legislation that would protect businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. The views of his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, who has opposed equal rights for LGBT people, also raise concerns about Trump's commitment to LGBT rights. Despite this, some LGBT Republicans continue to support Trump, believing that he will protect them from "violence and oppression."
