SUMMARY:
The Republican party has adopted its most anti-LGBT platform in history, sparking controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a proud gay Republican, addressed the GOP convention, acknowledging the party's stance on LGBT rights while emphasizing his American pride. Thiel criticized the transgender bathroom debate as a "distraction" from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, despite his party's platform opposing same-sex marriage and supporting "conversion therapy." Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds "extreme" views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." The contradictions between Trump's words and actions have raised questions about his true stance on LGBT issues. END OF SUMMARY.
