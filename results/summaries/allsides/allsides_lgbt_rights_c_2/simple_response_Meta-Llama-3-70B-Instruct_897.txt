SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are supporting Donald Trump, calling him the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, gave a speech at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay and Republican, but didn't explicitly address the party's platform. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy." Trump's own stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views opposing equal rights for LGBT people. The party's platform and Trump's ambiguous stance on LGBT issues are a distraction from real problems, as Thiel put it, and undermine the rights and dignity of LGBT individuals.

END OF SUMMARY.
