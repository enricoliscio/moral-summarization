SUMMARY:
The Republican Party's 2016 platform is being labeled as the most anti-LGBT in history, with stances opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and allowing businesses and agencies to refuse service to LGBT couples. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate yet. During his speech at the GOP convention, Peter Thiel, a gay man himself, chose not to admonish the party on LGBT rights as expected, instead calling attention to his pride in being both gay and Republican, and referring to the debate over transgender rights as a distraction. Trump has labeled himself a "friend" of the gay community and has many gay friends, but his stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views. While Trump has criticized debates over transgender bathroom rights and supports legislation protecting those who oppose same-sex marriage, he also claims to want to protect LGBT citizens and has congratulated gay friends on their civil unions. Trump's stance on gay rights remains ambiguous, and his actions, such as the choice of Pence as his running mate, suggest a more conservative approach than his words indicate. END OF SUMMARY.
