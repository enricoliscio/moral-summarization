SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, which has sparked controversy among pro-LGBT Republicans. Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder, addressed the GOP convention, proudly declaring himself gay and Republican, but also acknowledged not agreeing with every plank in the party's platform. Thiel criticized the focus on transgender rights, calling it a distraction from real problems. Donald Trump, who has called himself a "friend of the gay community," has been unclear on his stance, despite his party's platform opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and allowing businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views opposing equal rights for LGBT people, which may speak louder than Trump's words. The party's platform and Pence's views suggest a lack of support for LGBT rights, contradicting Trump's claim to "protect" LGBT citizens from "violence and oppression."
