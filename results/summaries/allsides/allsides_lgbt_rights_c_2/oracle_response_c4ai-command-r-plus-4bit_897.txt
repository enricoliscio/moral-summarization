SUMMARY: While the Republican Party has adopted what is considered the most anti-LGBT platform in its history, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel's speech downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, referring to it as a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend" of the gay community and has emphasized his gay acquaintances, but his actions and his party's platform suggest a different story. The Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy," allowing businesses and adoption agencies to refuse service to LGBT couples, and requiring transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth certificates. Trump has criticized debates about transgender bathroom rights and supports legislation that would protect individuals and businesses opposing same-sex marriage. The views of his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, further highlight the administration's stance, with Pence having actively opposed equal rights for LGBT people, deeming gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Trump's mixed messages and the anti-LGBT platform of the Republican Party raise questions about their true stance on LGBT rights and protection from violence and oppression.
