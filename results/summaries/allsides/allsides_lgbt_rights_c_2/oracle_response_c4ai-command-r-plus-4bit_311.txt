SUMMARY: While the Republican Party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate yet. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, stating that it is a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend" of the gay community and has emphasized his support for gay rights, including protection from "violence and oppression." However, his actions and policies suggest otherwise. Trump opposes federal support for same-sex marriage and has criticized debates over transgender bathroom rights. His running mate, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views and has actively opposed equal rights for LGBT individuals. Despite this, some LGBT Republicans continue to support Trump, believing that he will protect their rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
