Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues and how some pro-LGBT Republicans are supporting Donald Trump despite the party's platform. 

The article mentions Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, speaking at the GOP convention. He's proud to be gay and a Republican but criticizes the party's platform, calling the bathroom debate a distraction. 

Then it talks about Trump, who claims to be a friend of the gay community but his party's platform is against same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and restrictive bathroom laws. Trump's support seems unclear; he mentioned protecting LGBTQ citizens but didn't elaborate much at the convention. 

The article also notes that Trump has gay friends like Elton John and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which opposes same-sex marriage. His VP pick, Mike Pence, has extreme anti-LGBT views, which might indicate Trump's stance. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the conflicting positions within the GOP, Thiel's speech, Trump's mixed signals, and Pence's role. I'll make sure to include key points about the platform, Thiel's criticism, Trump's support claims vs. party policies, and Pence's influence.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party's 2016 platform, criticized by pro-LGBT groups, opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and restricts transgender bathroom access. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as their most supportive GOP candidate. Thiel, in a convention speech, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction. Trump has claimed to support LGBTQ rights, stating he would protect them as president, but his stance on same-sex marriage and conversion therapy remains unclear. While he has gay friends like Elton John and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has extreme anti-LGBT views, raising questions about Trump's true position on gay rights. END OF SUMMARY.
