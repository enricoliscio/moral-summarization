SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, which contradicts the views of some pro-LGBT Republicans, including Donald Trump, who claims to be a "friend of the gay community." However, the party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and refuses to serve LGBT couples in businesses and adoption agencies. Trump's stance on LGBT issues is unclear, but he has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which would provide broad protection to individuals and businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, opposing equal rights and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite this, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, proudly declared his support for Trump, calling the transgender bathroom debate a "distraction" from real problems. The party's platform and Trump's actions suggest a lack of commitment to protecting LGBT citizens from "violence and oppression." END OF SUMMARY.
