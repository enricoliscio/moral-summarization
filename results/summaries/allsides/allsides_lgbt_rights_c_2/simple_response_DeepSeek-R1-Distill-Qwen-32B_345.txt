Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Republican Party's stance on LGBT issues and how some pro-LGBT Republicans are supporting Donald Trump. The article mentions Peter Thiel's speech at the GOP convention, where he expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform. The platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and restrictive bathroom laws. Trump claims to support the LGBT community but hasn't been clear on his stance, especially on transgender rights. His vice president, Mike Pence, has extreme views against LGBT rights. The summary should capture the moral framing, highlighting the tension between individual support and the party's policies. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes key points like Thiel's speech, the platform's specifics, Trump's ambiguity, and Pence's extreme views.

SUMMARY: The Republican Party's 2016 platform has been criticized as the most anti-LGBT in history, opposing same-sex marriage, supporting conversion therapy, and backing laws that restrict LGBT rights, including bathroom policies. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. Thiel, in a speech at the GOP convention, expressed pride in being gay and a Republican but criticized the party's platform, calling transgender bathroom debates a distraction. Trump has claimed to be a "friend of the gay community," but his support remains unclear. He has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects those opposing same-sex marriage. Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has been described as having "more extreme" views on LGBT rights than any modern VP nominee, opposing equal rights for LGBT individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
