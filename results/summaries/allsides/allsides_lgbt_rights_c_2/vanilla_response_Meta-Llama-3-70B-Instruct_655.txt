SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted a platform that is being called the most anti-LGBT in party history, despite some pro-LGBT Republicans supporting Donald Trump as the most supportive candidate in GOP history. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention and expressed pride in being gay and Republican, but did not address the party's platform on LGBT issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports "conversion therapy." Trump's stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people. Pence has called gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite this, some Republicans believe Trump will protect LGBT citizens from violence and oppression.

END OF SUMMARY.
