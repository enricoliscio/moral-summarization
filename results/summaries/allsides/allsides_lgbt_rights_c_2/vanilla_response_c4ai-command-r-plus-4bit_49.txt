SUMMARY: The 2016 Republican Party Platform is considered the most anti-LGBT in history, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting conversion therapy and discriminatory laws. Despite this, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in being gay and Republican. Thiel's speech downplayed policy specifics and criticized the focus on transgender bathroom debates as a distraction. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" and has many gay friends, but his actions and words on LGBT rights are mixed. He opposes federal support for same-sex marriage and supports the First Amendment Defense Act. The views of his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, are more clearly opposed to LGBT rights. Pence has called gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse."
