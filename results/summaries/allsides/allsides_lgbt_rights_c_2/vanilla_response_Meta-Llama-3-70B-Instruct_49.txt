SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are supporting Donald Trump, calling him the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay, Republican, and American. He nodded to both sides, saying he doesn't agree with every plank in the party's platform. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and restricts transgender rights. Trump's stance on LGBT issues is unclear, but his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views against LGBT rights. Pence has opposed equal rights for LGBT people, calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse." Despite this, some Republicans believe Trump will protect LGBT citizens from violence and oppression.

END OF SUMMARY.
