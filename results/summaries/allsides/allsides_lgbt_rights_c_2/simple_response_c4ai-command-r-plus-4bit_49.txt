SUMMARY: Despite the Republican Party adopting an anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual identity and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, stating that it distracts from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community" and has many gay friends, but his actions and the platform of the Republican Party suggest otherwise. The party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports conversion therapy, and endorses laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals and couples. Trump has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports legislation that would protect businesses opposing same-sex marriage. The views of his running mate, Mike Pence, who has actively opposed equal rights for LGBT people, further highlight the contradictions between Trump's words and actions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
