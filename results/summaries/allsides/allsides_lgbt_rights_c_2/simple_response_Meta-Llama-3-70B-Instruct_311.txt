SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are supporting Donald Trump, who they claim is the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, gave a speech at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay, Republican, and American, but didn't address the party's anti-LGBT platform. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Trump's own stance on LGBT issues is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people. The contradiction between Trump's words and his party's platform raises questions about his commitment to LGBT rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
