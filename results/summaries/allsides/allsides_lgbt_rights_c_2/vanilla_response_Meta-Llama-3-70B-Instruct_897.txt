SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are supporting Donald Trump, calling him the most supportive GOP candidate in history. Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay, Republican, and American, but didn't explicitly address LGBT rights. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and allows businesses to refuse service to LGBT couples. Trump's stance on LGBT issues is unclear, but he has criticized transgender bathroom debates and supports the First Amendment Defense Act, which would protect individuals and businesses that oppose same-sex marriage. His vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme views on LGBT rights, having opposed equal rights for LGBT people and calling gay marriage a signal of "societal collapse."

END OF SUMMARY.
