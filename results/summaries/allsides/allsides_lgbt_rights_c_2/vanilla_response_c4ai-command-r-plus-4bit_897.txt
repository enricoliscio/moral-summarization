SUMMARY: While the Republican Party's 2016 platform is considered the most anti-LGBT in history, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexuality and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the transgender bathroom debate, saying it distracts from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a friend of the gay community and has many gay friends, but his stance on LGBT rights is unclear. He supports states' rights to decide on same-sex marriage and has criticized the transgender bathroom debate. His VP pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views. Pence has opposed equal rights for LGBT people, calling gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Despite mixed messages from Trump, the Republican Party's platform and Pence's views indicate a strong anti-LGBT stance.
END OF SUMMARY.
