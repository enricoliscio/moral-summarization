SUMMARY:
The Republican Party's platform has been described as the most anti-LGBT in history, with stances opposing same-sex marriage, supporting "conversion therapy," and endorsing laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals and couples. However, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate, citing his friendly stance towards the gay community and his promise to protect LGBTQ citizens. At the GOP convention, Peter Thiel, a gay man and PayPal co-founder, spoke of his pride in being gay and Republican but downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender rights, calling it a distraction. Trump himself has sent mixed signals, criticizing transgender bathroom debates while also congratulating gay friends like Elton John on their civil union. He supports states' rights to decide on same-sex marriage and backs the First Amendment Defense Act, which protects those opposed to it. The views of his running mate, Mike Pence, are more extreme, having called gay marriage a sign of "societal collapse." Trump's own stance remains unclear, but his actions and words suggest a more accepting approach towards the LGBT community than his party's platform. END OF SUMMARY.
