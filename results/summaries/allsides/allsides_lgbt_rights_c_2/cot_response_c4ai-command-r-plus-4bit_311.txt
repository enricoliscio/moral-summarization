SUMMARY: 
While the Republican Party has adopted what is considered the most anti-LGBT platform in history, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate ever. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, highlighted this contradiction in his speech at the GOP convention. While he expressed pride in being gay and Republican, Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate surrounding transgender rights, referring to it as a distraction from more pressing issues. Trump has positioned himself as a "friend" of the gay community and has emphasized his many gay friends, but his stance on LGBT issues is ambiguous. The Republican Party Platform opposes same-sex marriage, endorses conversion therapy, and supports laws that discriminate against LGBT individuals and couples. Trump's own statements on LGBT rights have been inconsistent, and his vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views. While Trump has criticized debates surrounding transgender bathroom rights and supports legislation that protects individuals and businesses opposing same-sex marriage, he has also congratulated gay friends on their civil unions. This confusing mix of signals has left many questioning where Trump truly stands on LGBT rights. END OF SUMMARY.
