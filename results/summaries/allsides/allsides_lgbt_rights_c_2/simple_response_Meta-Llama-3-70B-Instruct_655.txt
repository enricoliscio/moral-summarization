SUMMARY:

The Republican party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, but some pro-LGBT Republicans, like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, are supporting Donald Trump, calling him the most supportive candidate in GOP history. Thiel, who is gay, gave a speech at the GOP convention, saying he's proud to be gay and Republican, but didn't address the party's anti-LGBT platform. Trump has called himself a "friend of the gay community," but his party's platform opposes same-sex marriage, supports "conversion therapy," and restricts transgender rights. Trump's own stance is unclear, and his vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has a history of opposing equal rights for LGBT people. The party's platform and Pence's views suggest that Trump's support for the LGBT community may be superficial.

END OF SUMMARY.
