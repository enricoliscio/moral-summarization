SUMMARY: While the Republican Party has adopted an anti-LGBT platform, some pro-LGBT Republicans view Donald Trump as their most supportive candidate. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is gay, spoke at the GOP convention, expressing pride in his sexual orientation and his party affiliation. Thiel downplayed the importance of the debate over transgender bathroom rights, stating that it distracts from more pressing issues. Trump has called himself a "friend" of the gay community and has highlighted his gay friends, but his stance on LGBT rights is unclear. He has criticized transgender bathroom debates and opposes federal support for same-sex marriage, instead favoring state-level decisions. Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, holds extreme anti-LGBT views and has actively opposed equal rights for LGBT people. Trump's own actions and words suggest a conflicting stance on LGBT rights, with his vice-presidential pick sending a stronger message of opposition to LGBT rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
