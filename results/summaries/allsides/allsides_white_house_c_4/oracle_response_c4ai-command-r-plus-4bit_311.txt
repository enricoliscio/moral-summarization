SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which caused billions of dollars in damage across the Northeastern states. The request is expected to be for $50 to $60 billion, with a portion of the funds intended to prevent future devastation by building up the region's defenses against superstorms. Senators are discussing how to allocate the money, including whether to prioritize burying power lines underground to protect them from falling trees. The damage in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut is estimated to be upwards of $80 billion, and federal officials want to ensure that homes, businesses, and communities are rebuilt, restored, and made whole again. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, argues against providing just a "down payment" to the states, as it would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives. The disaster relief fund currently has $4.8 billion left, and there are debates about whether the disaster aid should be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
END OF SUMMARY.
