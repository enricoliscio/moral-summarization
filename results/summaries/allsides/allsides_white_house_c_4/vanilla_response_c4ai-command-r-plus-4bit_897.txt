SUMMARY: The White House plans to request emergency funding from Congress to aid in recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy, with estimates ranging from $50 to $60 billion. The request comes as federal officials face a shortage of funds to cover the extensive damage caused by the storm, with states like New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut reporting billions of dollars in damages. The Obama administration's point person on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, emphasized the need to not only rebuild but also enhance resilience against future superstorms. He argued that immediate funding is necessary to support families, businesses, and communities affected by the disaster. Donovan also rejected the idea of offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts elsewhere. Senators on the panel discussed the possibility of burying power lines underground to protect them from falling trees. The total damage estimate from the affected Northeastern states is about $80 billion.
