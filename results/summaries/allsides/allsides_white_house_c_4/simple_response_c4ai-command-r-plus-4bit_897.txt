SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress to address the billions of dollars in damages caused by Hurricane Sandy, with requests totaling $50-$60 billion. The Northeastern states impacted by the storm, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, are requesting approximately $80 billion in federal aid to recover from the widespread devastation. While the exact amount of funding is yet to be determined, the Obama administration's representative, Shaun Donovan, asserts that the money will not only be used to rebuild but also to strengthen the region's defenses against future superstorms. Lawmakers are discussing the allocation of funds, with some suggesting a "down payment" approach, providing a small amount of money now and more later. However, Donovan argues that such an approach would cause unnecessary hardships for families and communities already struggling to recover. He also emphasizes that disaster aid should not be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. The challenge now lies in reaching an agreement between Democrats and Republicans on how to best allocate the much-needed funds. END OF SUMMARY.
