Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The White House is asking for $50-60 billion in emergency funds. They want some of this money to go towards preventing future disasters. There's a lot of damage in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, totaling around $80 billion. They mention rebuilding smarter and more resiliently, like underground power lines, but also note that some solutions might have downsides, like in New York City. 

I should highlight the moral aspect, which seems to focus on responsibility and future preparedness. The administration is emphasizing not just immediate aid but also investing in resilience to prevent future suffering. There's also a point about not wanting to delay aid with a down payment, which shows concern for affected communities. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the funding request, then the damage, followed by the focus on future prevention, and finally the concerns about delayed aid. I'll make sure to mention the moral angle of responsibility and preparedness.
