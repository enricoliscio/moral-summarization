Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. The user has also listed specific morally framed words that should be included.

First, I need to understand what "moral framing" means here. It likely refers to the language used to convey the importance and necessity of the actions, such as preventing devastation, ensuring aid, and helping communities. The user wants the summary to retain these ethical and urgent tones.

Looking at the article, the main points are the request for $50-60 billion, the focus on rebuilding stronger, the damage assessment in states like New York and New Jersey, and the debate over how to allocate the funds. I need to condense this into a concise summary without losing the moral emphasis.

I should start by identifying the key morally framed words: preventing, devastation, damage, damaged, impacted, damages, aid, ensure, lost, rebuilt, restored, made, build, assistance, payment, hardships, help. I need to incorporate as many of these as possible.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the funding request, then the purpose of preventing future devastation. Next, I'll mention the damage assessments in the affected states. Then, I'll discuss the administration's focus on rebuilding smarter and the challenges in allocating funds without causing hardships. Finally, I'll note the disagreement on budget offsets.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral language where appropriate. For example, instead of saying "rebuilding," I'll use "rebuilt" or "restored" as in the original.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the funding request, moving to the damage, then the rebuilding efforts, and ending with the challenges in funding distribution. This will maintain the moral urgency and the key points from the article.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and that the overall message is clear and concise. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all important aspects are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50-$60 billion in emergency funding for Hurricane Sandy recovery, aiming to prevent future devastation. The storm caused $32.8 billion in damages in New York alone, with over 300,000 homes damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands still homeless. New Jersey and Connecticut also seek federal aid, totaling $80 billion. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized rebuilding smarter and stronger, focusing on resilient infrastructure. However, delaying aid could cause hardships for families and communities. The administration opposes offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, while some lawmakers suggest a smaller "down payment." FEMA head Craig Fugate highlighted the need for immediate assistance, as $4.8 billion remains in the disaster relief fund. The focus is on ensuring aid reaches those in need while preparing for future superstorms. END OF SUMMARY.
