Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the White House requesting emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. They're asking for between $50 to $60 billion. The key points are the damages, the need for funds, and the focus on future prevention. There are mentions of specific states and their damage estimates. Also, there's a discussion about rebuilding smarter and not just providing immediate aid but also ensuring future resilience.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like "preventing," "devastation," "damage," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the emergency funding, the extent of the damage, and the focus on future prevention. I also need to mention the concerns about delayed payments causing hardships.

I should start by stating the White House's request, then mention the damages in each state. Then, talk about the administration's focus on rebuilding smarter. Include the points about infrastructure improvements and the resistance to offsetting the aid with budget cuts. Finally, note the political aspects and the potential for hardships if the funding is delayed.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the key moral points are included. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50 to $60 billion in emergency funding for Hurricane Sandy recovery, emphasizing the need to prevent future devastation. States like New York and New Jersey face billions in damages, with over 300,000 homes and 265,000 businesses impacted. Federal officials stress rebuilding smarter and stronger, focusing on resilient infrastructure to protect against future superstorms. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan highlighted the importance of using funds to ensure communities are restored and made whole, while addressing long-term resilience. Senators discussed burying power lines to prevent outages, though FEMA head Craig Fugate cautioned against underground solutions in urban areas. Donovan warned that delayed payments would cause hardships, urging immediate aid to help families and businesses rebuild. The administration opposes offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, though political divisions remain. END OF SUMMARY.
