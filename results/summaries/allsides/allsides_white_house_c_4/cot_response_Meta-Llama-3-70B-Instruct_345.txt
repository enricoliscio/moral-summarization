SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy, with a focus on rebuilding "stronger, smarter, safer, and more resiliently." The damage from the storm is estimated to be around $80 billion, with New York alone accounting for $32.8 billion. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to rebuild with an "eye to the future," making decisions now to prevent similar devastation in the future. However, some lawmakers are suggesting a "down payment" of a smaller amount now, with the rest to come later, which Donovan argues would cause "hardships" for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Most Democrats agree that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. The administration is pushing for a comprehensive approach to rebuilding, rather than a piecemeal one.
