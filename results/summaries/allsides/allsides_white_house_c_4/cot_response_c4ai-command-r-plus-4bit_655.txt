SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which caused billions of dollars in damages and left a trail of devastation across the Northeastern states. The requested amount is expected to be between $50 billion and $60 billion, with a portion earmarked for building resilience against future superstorms. Senators from affected states, such as New York and New Jersey, have testified about the extent of the damage, with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand citing over 300,000 homes seriously damaged and billions of dollars in conservative estimates of damages. 

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, the Obama administration's point man on Sandy, emphasized the need to restore and rebuild stronger, smarter, and more resiliently. He argued that this involves making immediate decisions on the design, materials, and locations of rebuilding efforts. FEMA head Craig Fugate warned that simply providing a small amount of money now and more later would cause hardships for families and communities already struggling to recover. Donovan also believes that disaster aid should not be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. 

The White House and lawmakers are facing difficult choices with impending tax increases and spending cuts, and it remains to be seen whether Republicans will support the full funding request without offsets.
