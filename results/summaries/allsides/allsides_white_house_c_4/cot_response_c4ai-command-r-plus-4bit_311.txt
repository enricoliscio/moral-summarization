SUMMARY:
The White House is requesting emergency funding from Congress in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, with estimates ranging from $50 billion to $80 billion in federal aid. The Northeastern states, particularly New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, have experienced devastating damages, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes harmed, businesses impacted, and people homeless. The Obama administration's representative, Shaun Donovan, emphasizes the need to rebuild stronger and smarter, making communities whole again while also building defenses to protect against future superstorms. This involves making moral decisions about design, materials, and the rebuilding of certain areas. FEMA's Craig Fugate warns against the idea of a "down payment," arguing that it would cause hardships for those waiting for resources to rebuild their lives. The debate also revolves around whether disaster aid should be offset by budget cuts, with Democrats generally agreeing but Republicans' position unclear. The request for emergency funding highlights the moral imperative to act swiftly and effectively in the face of devastation, prioritizing the well-being of impacted communities.
