SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy, which caused enormous devastation and widespread damage. The damage is estimated to be upwards of $32.8 billion in New York alone, with similar tallies in New Jersey and Connecticut. The administration wants to use some of the funds to prevent future devastation by building back stronger, smarter, and safer. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to rebuild with a 21st-century response, making decisions now to ensure a more resilient future. However, providing only a small amount of the rebuilding money now, or "down payment," would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives. Donovan believes that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, a view shared by most Democrats.
