SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the enormous and widespread damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. The damage is estimated to be around $80 billion in the Northeastern states, with New York alone accounting for $32.8 billion. The administration wants to ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses are restored, and communities are made whole, but also "build back stronger, smarter, safer and more resiliently" to prevent similar devastation in the future. The funding will also be used to make decisions on how to rebuild, including designing and building boardwalks, making gas stations generator-capable, and deciding whether to rebuild in certain areas. Providing only a small amount of the rebuilding money now, or offsetting the disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget, would cause "hardships" for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives.
END OF SUMMARY.
