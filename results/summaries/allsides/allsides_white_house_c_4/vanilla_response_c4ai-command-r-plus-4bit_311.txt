SUMMARY: In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the White House plans to request emergency funding from Congress, with estimates ranging from $50 billion to $80 billion in federal aid. The Northeastern states affected by the storm, particularly New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, have incurred extensive damage, leaving thousands homeless and businesses impacted. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York testified that the damages in her state alone are estimated to be upwards of $32.8 billion. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, emphasized the need to build up defenses to protect against future superstorms and to rebuild communities stronger and safer. The Obama administration's disaster relief fund has approximately $4.8 billion remaining, and there is discussion among lawmakers about providing a small amount of rebuilding money now and more later. Donovan argues against this approach, stating that it would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives. The debate over disaster aid funding continues, with Democrats generally agreeing with Donovan's stance, while Republican support is uncertain.
