SUMMARY: Billions of dollars in damage and a depleted disaster relief fund have prompted the White House to request emergency funding from Congress to aid recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The request, expected to be between $50 and $60 billion, aims to address the immense devastation caused by the storm in several Northeastern states, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York shared the staggering numbers from her state, with over 300,000 homes severely damaged and billions of dollars in estimated damages. 

The Obama administration's point person on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, emphasized the need to not only rebuild but also to enhance resilience against future superstorms. He argued that tough decisions must be made now to ensure a "21st-century response," such as choosing the right design and materials for reconstruction. While some senators suggested burying power lines to protect them from falling trees, Craig Fugate of FEMA cautioned that this could lead to other issues, as seen in New York City. 

The administration currently has approximately $4.8 billion in its disaster relief fund, but Shaun Donovan, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, argues against a partial payment, saying it would cause undue hardship for those already suffering. He also believes that disaster aid should not be contingent on budget cuts elsewhere. The White House and lawmakers are facing challenging decisions with impending tax increases and spending cuts, and it remains uncertain whether Republicans will support the emergency funding request.
