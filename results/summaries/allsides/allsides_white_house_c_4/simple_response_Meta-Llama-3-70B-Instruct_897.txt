SUMMARY:

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the White House is seeking an emergency funding request of $50-60 billion to address the devastating damages and losses. The administration wants to use a significant portion of the funds to prevent future devastation by building stronger, smarter, and more resilient communities. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to make decisions now on how to rebuild, including designing boardwalks and deciding whether to rebuild in certain areas. The current disaster relief fund has only $4.8 billion left, and providing a small down payment now would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Donovan argued that a full funding request is necessary to avoid delays and that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. The moral imperative is clear: the government has a responsibility to act swiftly and comprehensively to support those affected by the disaster and to invest in a more resilient future.
