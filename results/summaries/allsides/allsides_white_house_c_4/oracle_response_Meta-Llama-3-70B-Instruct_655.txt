SUMMARY:

The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which caused enormous damage and widespread devastation. The storm left over 300,000 homes seriously damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands of people homeless, with estimated damages of $32.8 billion in New York alone. The administration wants to ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses restored, and communities made whole, but also to build back stronger, smarter, and more resiliently. This includes making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure to prevent future devastation. The administration is opposed to providing only a small down payment, which would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives. Instead, they want to provide adequate aid to help those affected, without offsetting the costs by cutting elsewhere in the budget.
