SUMMARY:

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastating damages and prevent future storms from causing similar destruction. The Northeastern states are requesting $80 billion in federal aid for storm-related damage, with New York alone estimating damages of $32.8 billion. The administration wants to use some of the funds to build up the region's defenses against future superstorms, making decisions now on design, materials, and infrastructure to ensure a "21st century response". However, with only $4.8 billion left in the disaster relief fund, the administration is urging against a "down payment" approach, which would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Instead, they argue that the aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, a stance that most Democrats agree with, but Republicans are unclear on.

END OF SUMMARY.
