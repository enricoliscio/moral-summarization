SUMMARY: The White House is preparing to request emergency funding from Congress to address the billions of dollars in damages caused by Hurricane Sandy. The request is expected to be between $50 billion and $60 billion, with a portion of the funds designated to prevent future devastation and strengthen the region's defenses against superstorms. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York shared the staggering impact of the storm on her state, with hundreds of thousands of homes damaged, businesses impacted, and residents left homeless. The Northeastern states affected by the storm are requesting a total of approximately $80 billion in federal aid. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Obama administration's lead on Sandy relief, emphasized the need to ensure that communities are not just rebuilt and restored but are made stronger, safer, and more resilient. He stressed the importance of making informed decisions before beginning the rebuilding process. FEMA head Craig Fugate warned against the idea of providing a partial payment now and a larger chunk later, arguing that it would cause hardships for families and communities already struggling to recover. The disaster aid request highlights the urgency of providing assistance and preventing further damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.
END OF SUMMARY.
