SUMMARY:

The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The damage is widespread, with over 300,000 homes seriously damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands of people still homeless. The estimated damages in New York alone are upwards of $32.8 billion. The administration wants to ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses restored, and communities made whole, but also build back stronger, smarter, and more resiliently to prevent future devastation. The funding will also go towards building up the region's defenses against future superstorms, including making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure to prevent damage. Providing only a small amount of aid now, or offsetting the disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget, would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
