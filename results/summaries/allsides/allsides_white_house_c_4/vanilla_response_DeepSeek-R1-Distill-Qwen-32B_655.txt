Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the White House is planning to ask Congress for $50 to $60 billion in emergency funds. They want some of this money to go towards preventing future disasters like Sandy. The damage was huge, especially in New York and New Jersey, with billions in damages and many homes and businesses affected.

Senator Gillibrand mentioned New York's damages were around $32.8 billion, and combined with New Jersey and Connecticut, they're asking for $80 billion. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan is in charge, and he wants to rebuild smarter, using better designs and materials, and maybe underground power lines, though that has its issues.

FEMA's head, Craig Fugate, mentioned they have $4.8 billion left but need more. Some in Congress suggest a smaller initial payment, but Donovan thinks that would delay recovery. He also doesn't want to cut other programs to fund this.

The main points are: emergency funding request, focus on future resilience, significant damages, and the debate over funding distribution. I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting these aspects without getting too detailed.

I should start by stating the White House's request, mention the amount, the purpose (rebuilding and future prevention), the damages, and the challenges in funding. Also, include the opposition to a down payment and the budget debate.

Let me structure it: first, the funding request and purpose. Then, the damages in each state. Next, the focus on rebuilding smarter. Then, the debate over immediate funding vs. down payment. Finally, the opposition to budget cuts.

I need to keep it concise, so each sentence should cover one main point without extra details. Let me make sure it's under 200 words and flows logically.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50 to $60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address damages from Hurricane Sandy, with a focus on rebuilding and enhancing resilience against future storms. New York alone reported $32.8 billion in damages, while Northeastern states collectively seek $80 billion in federal aid. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to rebuild smarter, using better designs and materials, and discussed potential infrastructure improvements like underground power lines. However, FEMA head Craig Fugate noted that burying lines in New York could cause issues. The administration opposes a smaller initial payment, as it would delay recovery, and argues against offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts. The funding request comes amid ongoing debates over year-end tax increases and spending cuts. END OF SUMMARY.
