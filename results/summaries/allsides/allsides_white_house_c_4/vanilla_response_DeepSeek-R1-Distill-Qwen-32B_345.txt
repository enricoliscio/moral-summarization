Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the White House is asking Congress for $50 to $60 billion in emergency funds. They want some of this money to prevent future disasters. The damage from Sandy was huge, especially in New York and New Jersey. Senator Gillibrand talks about the impact on homes, businesses, and the estimated damages. New York alone has over $32 billion in damages, and combined with other states, it's around $80 billion.

HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan is involved, and he's emphasizing the need to rebuild stronger and smarter. They're considering things like better materials for rebuilding, underground power lines, and whether certain areas should be rebuilt. There's also a mention of the remaining disaster relief funds and the debate over how to allocate the money without causing delays or budget cuts elsewhere.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the funding request amount, the focus on future prevention, the damage estimates, the rebuilding strategies, and the political aspects like budget offsets and down payments.

Let me structure this: start with the funding request, mention the purpose (rebuilding and future prevention), include the damage figures from NY and NJ, talk about the rebuilding strategies, and then touch on the political debate over funding allocation and budget offsets.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.
