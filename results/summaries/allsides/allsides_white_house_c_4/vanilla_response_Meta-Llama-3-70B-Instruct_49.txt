SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused widespread devastation, with estimated damages totaling $32.8 billion in New York alone and $80 billion across the Northeastern states. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan stated that the administration wants to use some of the funds to build up the region's defenses against future superstorms, making decisions on design, materials, and rebuilding strategies. FEMA head Craig Fugate warned that the current disaster relief fund has only $4.8 billion remaining, and a partial payment would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. The administration opposes offsetting the disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget, but it remains unclear whether Republicans will agree.

END OF SUMMARY.
