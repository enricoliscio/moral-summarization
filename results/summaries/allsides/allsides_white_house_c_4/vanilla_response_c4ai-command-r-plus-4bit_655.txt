SUMMARY: The White House is expected to request between $50 billion and $60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused extensive damage across the Northeastern states, with New York and New Jersey bearing the brunt of the impact. Senators from the affected states testified before Congress, requesting a total of $80 billion in federal aid to cover the costs of the storm's devastation. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, emphasized the need to not only rebuild but also to enhance the region's defenses against future superstorms. While the exact amount of the administration's request remains undisclosed, Donovan asserted that the disaster aid should not be offset by cuts in other areas of the budget. Some lawmakers suggested providing a small amount of money immediately for rebuilding efforts, but Donovan argued that such an approach would cause unnecessary delays in getting aid to those who need it. The disaster relief fund currently has approximately $4.8 billion remaining. Lawmakers are faced with the challenge of addressing the impending tax increases and spending cuts while also responding to the urgent need for disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.
