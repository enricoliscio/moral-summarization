Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the aftermath of Sandy, with billions in damages and the need for federal funding. The White House is asking Congress for $50-60 billion. They want some of this money to prevent future devastation, not just repair the damage. Senator Gillibrand gives some stats on the damage in New York, like 300,000 homes damaged and $32.8 billion in damages. New Jersey and Connecticut are also affected, totaling around $80 billion needed.

HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan mentions rebuilding smarter and stronger, using better designs and materials. They discuss things like underground power lines but note potential issues. FEMA's head, Craig Fugate, mentions they have $4.8 billion left but argue that a down payment would cause hardships, delaying recovery.

The summary needs to include the morally framed words: preventing, devastation, damage, damaged, impacted, damages, aid, ensure, lost, rebuilt, restored, made, build, assistance, payment, hardships, help. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to cover the funding request, the intent to prevent future damage, the extent of the damage, the need for aid, and the concerns about delayed assistance. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral terms are preserved.

Let me draft it:

The White House is seeking an emergency funding request of $50-60 billion to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, which damaged over 300,000 homes and impacted thousands of businesses. The funds aim to prevent future superstorms by rebuilding stronger and smarter. Senator Gillibrand highlighted New York's $32.8 billion in damages, while Northeastern states collectively seek $80 billion in federal aid. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to ensure communities are rebuilt and restored, using resilient designs. However, a down payment on aid would cause hardships, delaying recovery for families and businesses. The administration opposes offsetting disaster assistance with budget cuts, as many in Congress debate the funding approach.

I think this captures the main points and includes the moral terms. Let me check word countâ€”it's around 150 words, so it's good.
