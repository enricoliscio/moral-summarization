SUMMARY: In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the White House is set to request emergency funding of $50-$60 billion from Congress to aid in recovery and rebuilding efforts. The storm caused extensive damage in Northeastern states, with New York and New Jersey bearing the brunt. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York estimates the damages in her state alone to be over $32.8 billion. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has emphasized the need to build back stronger and more resiliently. This includes making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure improvements to protect against future storms. The request for funding has sparked discussions on allocating resources for preventative measures such as burying power lines underground. While some in Congress advocate for a smaller initial payment with more funding later, Donovan argues that a down payment would cause further hardships for those already impacted by the storm. He also asserts that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts in other areas of the budget. The outcome of the funding request remains uncertain as lawmakers grapple with impending tax increases and spending cuts.
