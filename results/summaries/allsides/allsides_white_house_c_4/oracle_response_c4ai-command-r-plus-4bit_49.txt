SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which caused billions of dollars in damage to Northeastern states. The request is expected to be for $50-60 billion, with a portion of the money going towards preventing future devastation and building resilience against superstorms. Senators are discussing how to allocate the funds, including whether to bury power lines underground to protect them from falling trees. The damage in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut is estimated to be upwards of $80 billion combined. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, has stated that the funding is needed to help families, small businesses, and communities impacted by the storm, and that a delay in providing the funds would cause hardships for those waiting to rebuild their lives. The article also mentions the debate over whether the disaster aid should be offset by cuts in other areas of the budget.
