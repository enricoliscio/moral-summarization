SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding to address the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The massive storm caused enormous damage, with over 300,000 homes seriously damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands of people left homeless. The Northeastern states are seeking around $80 billion in federal aid to prevent further devastation and ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses restored, and communities made whole. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to build back stronger, smarter, and more resiliently, making decisions now to prevent future superstorms. However, with only $4.8 billion left in the disaster relief fund, a down payment would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Donovan believes that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, and most Democrats agree. The administration's goal is to provide assistance, prevent future damage, and ensure a safer, more resilient response to natural disasters.
