Okay, so I need to help the user with summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided a news article about the White House seeking emergency funding after Hurricane Sandy. They want me to identify the morally framed words and then write a summary that includes those words.

I remember from the previous response that the first step was to list all the single words with moral framing. Words like "emergencies," "devastation," "homeless," "conservative," "resilience," "smarter," "safer," "hardships," and "resources" were identified. These words carry moral weight because they evoke emotions or ethical considerations.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less. I should make sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: the funding request, the need for disaster prevention, the impact on affected areas, and the debate over funding allocation.

I'll start by mentioning the White House's request for $50-60 billion. Then, I'll note that part of the funds are meant for preventing future disasters. I should include the specific damages in New York and New Jersey, using terms like "homeless" and "conservative estimate." 

Next, I'll talk about the focus on rebuilding smarter and safer, using words like "resilience," "smarter," and "safer." I'll mention the debate over underground power lines and the caution from FEMA. 

Finally, I'll address the opposition to a down payment approach, highlighting the hardships it would cause, using "hardships" and "resources." I'll also note the disagreement on budget offsets, which touches on the moral aspect of fair funding without cutting other programs.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. Let me put this together, making sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms.

* devastation  
* homeless  
* conservative  
* resilience  
* smarter  
* safer  
* hardships  
* resources  

**SUMMARY:**  
The White House has requested an emergency funding bill of $50â€“$60 billion to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, which left thousands homeless and caused billions in damages. Federal officials emphasize the need to rebuild smarter and safer, investing in resilience to prevent future disasters. New York and New Jersey alone estimate damages at $32.8 billion and $80 billion combined. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan stressed the importance of using funds to rebuild stronger and more resiliently, focusing on long-term solutions like underground power lines and generator-capable infrastructure. However, FEMA head Craig Fugate warned of potential underground issues in urban areas. Donovan opposed a "down payment" approach, arguing it would prolong hardships for families and communities awaiting aid. The administration also opposes offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, though Republican support remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
