SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy's devastation. The storm caused enormous damage, with over 300,000 homes seriously damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands still homeless in New York alone. The total damages are estimated to be upwards of $32.8 billion, with New Jersey and Connecticut also seeking significant aid. The administration wants to ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses restored, and communities made whole, but also to build back stronger and more resiliently. This includes making decisions on design and materials to prevent future devastation. While some in Congress propose providing a small down payment now and a larger chunk later, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan warns that this would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Instead, he believes the aid should be provided without offsets or cuts elsewhere in the budget.
