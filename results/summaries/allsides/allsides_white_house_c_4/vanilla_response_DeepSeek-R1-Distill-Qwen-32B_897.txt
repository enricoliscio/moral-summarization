Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the White House will request an emergency funding bill of around $50 to $60 billion. They want some of this money to be used for preventing future storms' devastation. Then, it talks about the damage in New York, with Senator Gillibrand giving some numbers: over 300,000 homes damaged, 265,000 businesses affected, and about $32.8 billion in damages. New Jersey and Connecticut also have significant damages, and together the Northeast is asking for $80 billion.

HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan is mentioned, saying that part of the funds should go towards building resilience against future storms. They want to rebuild smarter, using better designs and materials. There's a discussion about burying power lines, but FEMA's head points out that it might not be feasible in all areas, like New York City.

The article also notes that the administration has $4.8 billion left in disaster relief funds but needs more. Some in Congress want to give a small amount now and more later, but Donovan argues this would delay recovery. He doesn't think the aid should be funded by cutting other programs, and while Democrats agree, it's unclear if Republicans will support this.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: the funding request, the damage figures, the focus on future resilience, the debate on infrastructure improvements, and the political stance on funding.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the White House's funding request and its purpose. Then mention the damage in New York and the total Northeast request. Highlight Donovan's emphasis on building resilience. Discuss the infrastructure ideas like burying power lines and the counterarguments. Finally, note the funding debate and political divide.

I need to keep each sentence concise and avoid unnecessary details. Make sure to stay under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.
