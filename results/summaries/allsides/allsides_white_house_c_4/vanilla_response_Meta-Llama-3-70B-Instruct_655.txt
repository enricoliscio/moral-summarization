SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The damage from the storm is estimated to be around $80 billion, with New York alone accounting for $32.8 billion. The administration plans to use some of the funds to prevent future devastation by building stronger defenses against superstorms. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to rebuild "stronger, smarter, safer, and more resiliently" and to make decisions now on how to rebuild. The administration opposes providing a small amount of money now and a larger chunk later, as it would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Democrats agree that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, but it's unclear if Republicans will agree.

END OF SUMMARY.
