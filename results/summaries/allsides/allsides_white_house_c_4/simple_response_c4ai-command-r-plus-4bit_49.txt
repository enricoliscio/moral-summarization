SUMMARY: The White House is facing a moral dilemma in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, with billions of dollars in damages and insufficient funds to cover the costs. The federal government's response to this crisis will have a significant impact on the lives of those affected by the storm. The states impacted by Sandy, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, are requesting a total of $80 billion in federal aid to recover from the storm's devastation. The Obama administration, through Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, is committed to not only rebuilding but also building back stronger and more resilient communities. They aim to make decisions now that will inform the rebuilding process, ensuring a "21st-century response." FEMA's Craig Fugate warns that a "down payment" approach to funding may cause unnecessary delays in getting resources to those in need. Donovan also emphasizes the importance of prioritizing disaster aid over budget cuts. The White House's request for emergency funding from Congress underscores its commitment to moral responsibility and ensuring the well-being of those affected by this natural disaster. END OF SUMMARY.
