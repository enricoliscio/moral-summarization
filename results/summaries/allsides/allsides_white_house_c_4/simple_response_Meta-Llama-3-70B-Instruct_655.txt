SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy, with a focus on not only rebuilding but also preventing future devastation. The damage from the storm is estimated to be around $80 billion, with over 300,000 homes seriously damaged and thousands of people still homeless. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to "build back stronger, smarter, safer and more resiliently‚Äù by making informed decisions about design, materials, and infrastructure. While some lawmakers propose providing a small amount of funding now and more later, Donovan argues that this would cause undue hardship to families and communities waiting to rebuild. He also opposes offsetting disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget. The moral imperative is clear: the government has a responsibility to provide timely and sufficient aid to those affected by the storm, and to prioritize building a more resilient future.
