Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. I need to focus on the morally charged words the author used.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The White House is asking for $50-60 billion, aiming to prevent future devastation. They mention rebuilding homes, restoring businesses, and making communities resilient. There's also a discussion about funding now versus later and concerns about hardships if delayed.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: preventing, devastation, damage, damaged, impacted, damages, aid, ensure, lost, rebuilt, restored, made, build, assistance, payment, hardships, help.

I should make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure the summary by first stating the funding request, then the goals of preventing future damage, the extent of the damage, and the need for immediate aid. I'll mention the $50-60 billion range, the focus on rebuilding stronger, the concerns about delayed payments causing hardships, and the opposition to budget cuts.

I should ensure that each morally framed word is used naturally in the context. For example, using "prevent" when talking about future storms, "aid" when referring to federal assistance, and "hardships" when discussing delayed payments.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, highlighting the moral imperative to help affected communities while preparing for future disasters without causing further difficulties.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, which inflicted billions in damages across the Northeast. Federal officials aim to ensure that rebuilding efforts not only restore damaged homes, businesses, and communities but also build back stronger and smarter to prevent future superstorms. Senators highlighted the need for immediate aid, with New York alone estimating $32.8 billion in damages. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the importance of using funds to enhance resilience, such as improving infrastructure and ensuring safer designs. However, delays in funding could cause hardships for families and businesses waiting to rebuild. Donovan also opposed offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, stressing the urgent need for full assistance to help communities recover and prepare for future challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
