Hardships*

SUMMARY:
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, federal officials are facing billions in *damages* and a lack of funds. The White House is requesting emergency funding of $50-$60 billion from Congress, with the aim to not only repair the *devastation* caused by the storm but also to fortify the region against future disasters. Senators from affected states, such as New York and New Jersey, have testified about the extensive *damages* and *homelessness* resulting from the storm, with total costs estimated at upwards of $80 billion. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, has emphasized the need to "build back stronger, smarter, safer, and more resiliently." However, there is debate in Congress about the timing and amount of funding to be provided, with some suggesting a "down payment" now followed by a larger sum later. Secretary Donovan argues that such an approach would cause *hardships* for those waiting to rebuild their lives. The debate also revolves around whether disaster aid should be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. Most Democrats seem amenable to the request, but it remains unclear if Republicans will agree.
