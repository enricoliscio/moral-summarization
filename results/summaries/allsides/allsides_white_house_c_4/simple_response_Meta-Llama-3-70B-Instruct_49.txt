SUMMARY:

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastating damages and prevent future catastrophes. The Northeastern states are requesting $80 billion in federal aid for storm-related damage, with New York alone estimating damages of $32.8 billion. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to "build back stronger, smarter, safer and more resiliently" by investing in preventative measures such as designing boardwalks to withstand future storms and burying power lines underground. However, FEMA head Craig Fugate cautioned that such measures may not be suitable for all areas. The administration is urging Congress to provide the full funding amount, warning that a "down payment" would cause undue hardship to families and communities waiting to rebuild. Most Democrats agree, but Republican support is uncertain. The moral imperative is clear: it is the government's responsibility to provide timely and adequate support to those affected by natural disasters.
