SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the enormous damages caused by Hurricane Sandy. The storm left a trail of devastation, with over 300,000 homes seriously damaged, 265,000 businesses impacted, and thousands of people still homeless in New York alone. The administration wants to ensure that homes are rebuilt, businesses restored, and communities made whole, but also to build back stronger, smarter, safer, and more resiliently. This includes making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure to prevent similar devastation in the future. However, providing only a small amount of the rebuilding money now, or offsetting disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget, would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives.
