SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery and rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Sandy, which caused billions of dollars in damage. The request is expected to be between $50 and $60 billion, with a portion of the funds allocated to prevent future devastation and build resilience against superstorms. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York testified that her state alone has estimated damages of upwards of $32.8 billion, while the Northeastern states impacted by the storm are requesting a combined total of $80 billion in federal aid. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, emphasized the need to ensure that homes and businesses are rebuilt and communities are restored and made whole. He also highlighted the importance of building back stronger and safer, making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure improvements before rebuilding begins. The Obama administration's disaster relief fund currently has $4.8 billion left, and there are discussions in Congress about providing a small amount of rebuilding money now and more later. However, Donovan argues that such a delay would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild their lives. He also believes that disaster aid should not be offset by budget cuts elsewhere.
