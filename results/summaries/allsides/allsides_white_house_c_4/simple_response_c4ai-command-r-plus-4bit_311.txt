SUMMARY: The White House is set to request emergency funding from Congress for billions of dollars in damages caused by Hurricane Sandy, with federal officials emphasizing the need to allocate funds not only for rebuilding but also for fortifying the region against future superstorms. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., testified that her state alone suffered over 300,000 damaged homes, impacted 265,000 businesses, and incurred estimated damages of at least $32.8 billion. Combined, the Northeastern states affected by the storm are requesting around $80 billion in federal aid. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Obama administration's point man on Sandy, stressed the importance of building back stronger and more resiliently. He highlighted the need for proactive decisions regarding design, materials, and the potential risks of rebuilding in certain areas. FEMA head Craig Fugate noted that while the administration has about $4.8 billion left in its disaster relief fund, a simple "down payment" from Congress would cause hardships for those waiting to rebuild their lives. Donovan also argued against offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts elsewhere. The moral imperative is clear: allocate sufficient funds to aid those affected by the storm and build a more resilient future.
END OF SUMMARY.
