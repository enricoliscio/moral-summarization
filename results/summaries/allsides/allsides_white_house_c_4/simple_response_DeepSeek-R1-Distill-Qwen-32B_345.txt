Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. The key points are the $50-60 billion request, the focus on future prevention, the damage in states like New York and New Jersey, the need for immediate funds, and the debate over how to allocate the money without causing delays or hardships. I should ensure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the necessity of rebuilding smarter and the potential consequences of delayed funding. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly with the SUMMARY and END tokens.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, with a focus on rebuilding and enhancing infrastructure resilience. New York and New Jersey alone estimate damages at $32.8 billion and $80 billion combined. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need for "smarter, safer" rebuilding, including improved design and infrastructure decisions. Senators discussed burying power lines, though FEMA head Craig Fugate cautioned against underground solutions in urban areas. Donovan warned that delaying aid would prolong hardships for families and communities, and opposed offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts. The administration seeks immediate funding to avoid prolonged suffering, highlighting the moral imperative to rebuild effectively and equitably. END OF SUMMARY.
