SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The devastating storm caused widespread damage, with New York alone estimating $32.8 billion in damages and over 300,000 homes seriously damaged. The administration plans to use some of the funds to prevent future devastation by building up the region's defenses against superstorms. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to "build back stronger, smarter, safer and more resiliently‚Äù and make decisions now on how to rebuild. Some lawmakers propose providing a small amount of funding now and more later, but Donovan argues this would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. The administration also opposes offsetting disaster aid with cuts elsewhere in the budget. The moral imperative is clear: providing timely and sufficient aid to those affected by the storm is essential to help them rebuild their lives.
