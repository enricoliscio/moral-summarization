SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. The damage is estimated to be around $80 billion in the Northeastern states, with New York alone accounting for $32.8 billion. The administration wants to use the funds not only to rebuild but also to build back stronger, smarter, safer, and more resiliently. This includes making decisions on design and materials, as well as considering whether to rebuild in certain areas. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized that a down payment would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. He also believes that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. Most Democrats agree, but it's unclear if Republicans will go along. The administration is pushing for a comprehensive approach to address the devastation and ensure a 21st-century response.
