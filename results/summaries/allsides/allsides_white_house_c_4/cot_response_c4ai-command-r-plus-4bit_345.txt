SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, with billions of dollars in damages and a devastating impact on the Northeastern states. The request, estimated at $50-$60 billion, aims to provide aid for the affected regions and build defenses to protect against future superstorms. The devastation caused by Sandy has left hundreds of thousands of homes damaged, businesses impacted, and families and communities struggling. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., testified that the damages in her state alone are upwards of $32.8 billion, a conservative estimate. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Shaun Donovan, emphasized the need to rebuild stronger, smarter, and safer communities, with an emphasis on resilience. He also highlighted the importance of appropriate design and materials in rebuilding. The question of whether to rebuild boardwalks, gas stations, and power lines underground, considering the potential problems, was also raised. While some in Congress suggest providing a down payment for rebuilding, Donovan argues that it would cause hardships for those waiting for resources to get on with their lives. The issue of disaster aid offsetting budget cuts is also being debated, with most Democrats in favor and Republicans' stance unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
