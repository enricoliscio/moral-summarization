SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused widespread devastation, with New York alone estimating $32.8 billion in damages and over 300,000 homes seriously damaged. The administration wants to use some of the funds to prevent future devastation by building up the region's defenses against superstorms. This includes making decisions on design and materials for rebuilding, as well as considering burying power lines underground to protect them from falling trees. The administration opposes providing a small amount of funding now with a larger chunk later, citing that it would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild. Democrats largely agree, but it's unclear if Republicans will support the request without offsetting the costs with budget cuts.

END OF SUMMARY.
