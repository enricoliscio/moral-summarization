SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding of $50-60 billion to address the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which caused widespread damage and loss of life. The damage is estimated to be around $80 billion in the Northeastern states, with New York alone suffering damages of $32.8 billion. The administration wants to ensure that the affected communities are rebuilt, restored, and made whole, but also wants to build back stronger, smarter, and more resiliently to prevent future devastation. The funding will also go towards providing assistance to families and small businesses that are still homeless and struggling to recover. The administration is opposed to providing a down payment, which would cause hardships and delay the rebuilding process. Instead, they want to provide the necessary aid to help communities get back on their feet. The funding should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, as most Democrats agree. END OF SUMMARY.
