SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused widespread devastation, with estimated damages of $32.8 billion in New York alone and a combined total of $80 billion in the Northeastern states. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan stated that the administration wants to use the funds not only to rebuild but also to build back stronger and more resiliently, with a focus on preventing future devastation. Some senators suggested burying power lines underground to protect them from falling trees, but FEMA head Craig Fugate warned that this approach may not be suitable for all areas. The administration opposes providing a small "down payment" of funds now, with the rest to come later, as it would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to rebuild.

END OF SUMMARY.
