SUMMARY: The White House is set to request emergency funding from Congress to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, with the total amount requested expected to be between $50 billion and $60 billion. The storm caused extensive damage to the Northeastern states, with New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut bearing the brunt of the impact. Senators from these states have testified about the extensive damage and the need for federal aid to help their constituents rebuild their homes and businesses and get their lives back on track. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, has emphasized the need to not only rebuild but also to build back stronger and more resiliently to protect against future superstorms. This involves making thoughtful decisions about design, materials, and infrastructure improvements such as generator-capable gas stations and the potential of burying power lines underground. The administration currently has limited funds available for disaster relief, and there is discussion about providing a small amount of rebuilding money now and the rest later. However, Donovan argues that such an approach would cause unnecessary hardships for those already struggling to recover. He also believes that disaster aid should not be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. The White House and lawmakers are facing challenging decisions as they navigate the request for emergency funding while also dealing with impending tax increases and spending cuts.
