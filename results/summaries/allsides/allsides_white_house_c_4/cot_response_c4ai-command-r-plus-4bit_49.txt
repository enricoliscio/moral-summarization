SUMMARY:
The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress to address the billions of dollars in damages caused by Hurricane Sandy. The request, estimated to be between $50 billion and $60 billion, aims to provide relief and rebuild the affected regions, with an emphasis on preventing future devastation and increasing resilience against superstorms. Senators from the impacted Northeastern states, including New York and New Jersey, have testified about the extensive damage and requested federal aid amounting to approximately $80 billion. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, emphasized the need to rebuild stronger and safer communities while making decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure resilience before commencing the rebuilding process. FEMA head Craig Fugate highlighted the remaining disaster relief fund of $4.8 billion, but some in Congress advocate for a smaller initial payment with a more substantial sum later. Donovan argued against this approach, stating that it would cause unnecessary hardships for families and communities already struggling to recover. He also asserted that disaster aid should not be contingent on budget cuts elsewhere. Most Democrats agree, but Republican support remains unclear.
