SUMMARY: The White House is set to request emergency funding from Congress to aid in recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy, with estimates ranging from $50 to $60 billion. The storm caused extensive damage across the Northeastern states, with New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut bearing the brunt of the impact, totaling upwards of $80 billion in federal aid requests. The funding request aims to not only rebuild and restore the affected areas but also to enhance their resilience against future superstorms. Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, emphasized the need to make informed decisions before commencing the rebuilding process, considering factors such as design, materials, and the potential for future disasters. The discussion also addressed the possibility of burying power lines underground to protect them from falling trees. While some lawmakers suggest providing a small amount of funding now and more later, Shaun Donovan argues that a "down payment" would cause unnecessary delays in getting people's lives back on track. The question of offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts remains a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans.
