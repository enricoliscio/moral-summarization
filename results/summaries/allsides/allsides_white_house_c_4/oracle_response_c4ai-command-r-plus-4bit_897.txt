SUMMARY: The White House is seeking emergency funding from Congress to aid in recovery and prevention efforts following Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused billions of dollars in damage across several Northeastern states, leaving thousands of people homeless and businesses impacted. The total damages are estimated to be upwards of $80 billion. The Obama administration's point man on Sandy, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, has emphasized the need to not only ensure that homes are rebuilt and businesses restored but also to build back stronger and safer, making the region more resilient to future superstorms. This involves making thoughtful decisions about design, materials, and whether to rebuild in certain areas. The administration has about $4.8 billion left in its disaster relief fund, but that is not enough to cover the cost of rebuilding. Providing a small amount of money now and more later would cause hardships for families and communities waiting to get on with their lives. The disaster aid should not be offset by budget cuts, as it is crucial to provide assistance to those in need without causing further delays or suffering.
END OF SUMMARY.
