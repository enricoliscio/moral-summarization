Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a summary using as many of those words as possible without making it too long, just under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The White House is seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy, around $50-60 billion. They want some money for preventing future devastation, not just repairing the damage. Senators are talking about the extent of the damage in their states, like New York and New Jersey. There's a focus on rebuilding smarter and more resiliently. They mention specific ideas like burying power lines but also note potential issues. There's a debate about how to fund this, whether to give a down payment now or wait, and concerns about budget cuts.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list: preventing, devastation, damage, damaged, impacted, damages, aid, ensure, lost, rebuilt, restored, made, build, assistance, payment, hardships, help.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating the White House's request and their intention to prevent future devastation. Then mention the damage in the states, using the specific numbers. Next, talk about the rebuilding efforts, using words like ensure, rebuilt, restored, made whole. Highlight the focus on building resilience, using build, smarter, safer. Then, discuss the debate over funding methods, using payment, hardships, and the opposition to budget cuts. Finally, note the political agreement among Democrats but uncertainty with Republicans.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate the moral terms without forcing them. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The White House is seeking an emergency funding request of $50 to $60 billion to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, which inflicted billions in damages across the Northeast. Federal officials emphasize the need to prevent future superstorms by rebuilding smarter and more resiliently. New York and New Jersey alone are seeking over $80 billion in federal aid, with New York reporting over 300,000 damaged homes and $32.8 billion in estimated damages. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan stressed the importance of ensuring communities are made whole while building back stronger, including decisions on design, materials, and infrastructure. Senators discussed burying power lines to protect against future storms, though FEMA head Craig Fugate cautioned against underground solutions in urban areas. The administration opposes using budget cuts to offset disaster aid, as families and businesses face hardships waiting for assistance. A down payment on rebuilding funds would delay relief, leaving communities in limbo. END OF SUMMARY.
