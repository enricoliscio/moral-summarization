SUMMARY:

The White House is set to request $50-60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to aid in the recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy. The storm caused widespread damage, with estimated damages in New York alone reaching $32.8 billion. The funding will not only go towards rebuilding but also towards preventing future devastation by building up the region's defenses against superstorms. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized the need to "build back stronger, smarter, safer and more resiliently‚Äù and make decisions now on how to rebuild, including using durable materials and considering burying power lines underground. With only $4.8 billion remaining in the disaster relief fund, officials are urging for a comprehensive funding package rather than a partial down payment, which could cause further hardships for affected families and communities.
