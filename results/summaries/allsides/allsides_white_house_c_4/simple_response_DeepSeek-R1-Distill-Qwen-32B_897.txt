Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the White House requesting emergency funding after Hurricane Sandy. They're asking for between $50 to $60 billion. The officials want some of this money to go towards preventing future disasters, not just repairing the damage. They mention rebuilding smarter and more resiliently. 

Senators are talking about the damage in their states, especially New York and New Jersey, which are asking for about $80 billion. There's a focus on long-term solutions like burying power lines, which could help prevent future outages but might have other issues, like in New York City where underground systems caused problems.

There's also a debate about how to fund this. Some in Congress want to give a small amount now and more later, but the administration says that would delay recovery. They don't want to cut other parts of the budget to pay for this aid.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the funding request, the focus on future prevention, the states' damage estimates, the discussion on infrastructure improvements, and the funding debate. Also, the moral aspect is about prioritizing recovery and future safety over political or budgetary concerns.

I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me start by mentioning the funding request, then the states' damage, the focus on resilience, the infrastructure ideas, and the funding concerns. Make sure to highlight the moral stance of addressing both immediate and future needs without delay.

SUMMARY: The White House is seeking an emergency $50-$60 billion funding request for Hurricane Sandy recovery, with a focus on preventing future disasters. New York and New Jersey alone estimate $32.8 billion and $80 billion in damages, respectively. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan emphasized rebuilding "smarter, safer, and more resiliently," including infrastructure improvements like burying power lines. However, FEMA head Craig Fugate warned of potential underground issues. Senators discussed long-term solutions, but some in Congress propose a small initial payment, which Donovan opposes, fearing delays in recovery. The administration also opposes offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, highlighting the moral imperative to address immediate and future needs without hardship. END OF SUMMARY.
