Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, let me read the article first. It's about the White House seeking emergency funds after Hurricane Sandy. The damages are huge, around $80 billion for the Northeast. They want to not only rebuild but also make the infrastructure more resilient for future storms.

Wait, the user mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, I need to focus on the moral aspects. The article talks about the need for immediate aid and future prevention. There's a debate on how to allocate the funds without causing more problems, like cutting other budgets. Also, the moral responsibility to help communities recover and prevent future disasters.

I should make sure the summary captures the emergency funding request, the scale of damages, the focus on resilience, and the political challenges. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but include all key points. Also, end with the tokens as specified. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring the moral elements are highlighted, like the need for immediate help and responsible allocation of funds without harming other areas.

SUMMARY: The White House plans to request $50â€“$60 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, which has left billions in damages across the Northeast. New York and New Jersey alone are seeking around $80 billion in federal aid. While immediate relief is critical, officials emphasize the need to rebuild infrastructure more resiliently to prevent future disasters. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan stressed the importance of "building back stronger, smarter, and safer," including decisions on infrastructure design and storm preparedness. Senators discussed ideas like burying power lines, though FEMA head Craig Fugate cautioned against underground solutions in certain areas. Donovan warned against delaying aid, stating that a "down payment" would prolong suffering for families and communities. The administration opposes offsetting disaster aid with budget cuts, but political challenges remain as Congress grapples with year-end fiscal issues. END OF SUMMARY.
