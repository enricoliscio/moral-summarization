Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing, especially focusing on the words "help" and "protect." Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Obama's team felt the Republican National Convention was a miss, but actually, the Republicans changed their strategy. Instead of attacking Obama directly, they focused on disappointmentâ€”how he hasn't fulfilled his 2008 promises. They presented themselves as if they were Obama supporters, lamenting his unmet potential. This approach was subtle and effective, aiming to shift the narrative without direct attacks.

I need to make sure to include the moral words "help" and "protect." Looking back, Mitt Romney used "help" when he said, "My promise is to help you and your family." Paul Ryan mentioned "protect" when talking about Medicare. So I should include these phrases in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the strategic shift in the Republicans' messaging. I'll structure it to first mention Obama's team's initial assessment, then the Republican strategy, the use of "help" and "protect," and the overall impact on the campaign narrative.

Let me draft that, making sure to keep it within the word limit and include the moral framing elements.

SUMMARY: Obama's team dismissed the Republican National Convention as a failure, but Republicans subtly shifted their strategy to focus on disappointment, suggesting Obama hasn't fulfilled his 2008 promises. By positioning themselves as Obama supporters, they lamented his unmet potential, a more dangerous approach than direct attacks. Mitt Romney emphasized "helping" families, while Paul Ryan vowed to "protect" Medicare, aligning with Democratic values. This strategic shift aimed to alter the narrative without overt criticism, potentially softening Obama's position. END OF SUMMARY.
