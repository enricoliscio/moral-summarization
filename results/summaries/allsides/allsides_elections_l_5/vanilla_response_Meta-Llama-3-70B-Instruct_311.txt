SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but a subtle shift in GOP messaging has emerged. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations, which is a more dangerous strategy for Obama than previous attacks. The disappointment theme, that Obama's promises to mend the economy, transform politics, and save the earth have faded, resonated throughout the convention. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's speeches emphasized this theme, with Rubio stating "Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person. Our problem is that he's a bad president." The tone of the convention was honed, with shrill hyperbole and petty critiques disappearing. The convention featured appealing speeches from Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, which sounded like a Democratic gathering at times. Overall, the convention landed a strategic body blow to Obama, subtly shifting momentum and softening him up for the rest of the fight.

END OF SUMMARY.
