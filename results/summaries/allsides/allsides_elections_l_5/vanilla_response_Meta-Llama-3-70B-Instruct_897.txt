SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa was seen as a disappointment by President Barack Obama's team, but in reality, it marked a subtle shift in GOP messaging that could be more dangerous for Obama. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and promising to help individuals and families. They honed their tone, replacing shrill hyperbole with more measured criticism. The convention featured appealing speakers, including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, who spoke about opportunities and protecting Medicare. The disappointment theme, which acknowledges that Obama's promises to mend the economy, transform politics, and save the earth have faded, could be a powerful strategy for Republicans. While no knockout punches were landed, the convention's subtle body blows could soften Obama up for the rest of the fight.

END OF SUMMARY.
