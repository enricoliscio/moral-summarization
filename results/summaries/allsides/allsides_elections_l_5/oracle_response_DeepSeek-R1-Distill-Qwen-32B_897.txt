Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words "help" and "protect." Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Republican National Convention and how Obama's team is spinning it as a miss. The key theme is disappointment with Obama, comparing him to his 2008 image. Republicans are shifting their strategy to focus on unfulfilled promises instead of just attacking him.

Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio are mentioned, emphasizing the disappointment theme. Romney talks about helping families, and Rubio highlights the need to protect Medicare. The Republicans are toning down their attacks and trying to align more with Obama's initial message.

I need to include the moral words "help" and "protect." Also, keep the summary under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure this: mention the disappointment theme, Republicans' new strategy, Romney and Rubio's statements, and the shift in messaging. Make sure to include the moral terms.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me draft it concisely, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa focused on the theme of disappointment, targeting President Barack Obama's unfulfilled promises from 2008. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a failure, Republicans subtly shifted their strategy, positioning themselves as Obama supporters who now lament his broken commitments. Mitt Romney emphasized helping families, while Marco Rubio highlighted the need to protect Medicare, aligning their rhetoric with Obama's initial vision. This approach aimed to soften Obama's image and shift momentum, rather than launching direct attacks. The convention also saw Republicans adopting a more toned-down tone, avoiding shrill critiques, and presenting a more empathetic image, even as they criticized Obama's record. The focus on helping and protecting resonated with voters, suggesting a strategic effort to counter Obama's narrative. END OF SUMMARY.
