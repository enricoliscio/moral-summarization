Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing, especially the words "help" and "protect." The article talks about the Republican National Convention and how they targeted Obama's unfulfilled potential. The Republicans tried to position themselves as disappointed Obama supporters, which was a strategic move. They focused on themes like helping families and protecting Medicare. I should highlight how this approach was effective without being too harsh. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the key moral terms. Let me structure it to show the shift in strategy and its impact on Obama's campaign.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in messaging, targeting President Barack Obama's unfulfilled potential. Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, refrained from the usual kitchen-sink attacks and instead positioned themselves as disappointed Obama supporters from 2008. They emphasized themes like "helping" families and "protecting" Medicare, echoing Democratic rhetoric. Romney vowed to "help" families, while Rubio criticized Obama's presidency without attacking his character. This subtle approach aimed to shift momentum and soften Obama's image, rather than delivering a knockout blow. The convention also showcased a more moderate tone, with speakers like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez highlighting American opportunities. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a miss, the GOP's strategic pivot posed a more dangerous challenge, focusing on disappointment and unmet promises. END OF SUMMARY.
