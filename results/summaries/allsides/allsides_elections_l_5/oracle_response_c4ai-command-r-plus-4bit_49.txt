SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failed attempt to discredit the president, but a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging may pose a greater threat to Obama's campaign than expected. Republicans posed as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging the power of the disappointment theme in recognizing that the hope Obama once offered has faded. This strategic body blow aims to shift momentum and soften up Obama in a subtle yet powerful way. The GOP toned down its usual hyperbole and tough criticism, instead emphasizing the unique opportunities that America affords and the potential for individuals to rise to leadership positions. The Republican convention featured an appealing young vice-presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, who vowed to protect Medicare for seniors, and speakers like Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez, who spoke of their own experiences rising to leadership roles. This shift in messaging presents a new challenge for Obama, as it targets the very hope and potential that Obama's campaign originally stood for.
END OF SUMMARY.
