SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failure that did not lay a glove on the president. However, Republicans shifted their messaging to pose as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging his unfulfilled potential and their own disappointment in his presidency. This strategy is seen as more dangerous for Obama than previous kitchen-sink attacks. The GOP recognized the power of the disappointment theme, highlighting the fading hope Obama offered for the economy, politics, and the environment. The convention featured an appealing young VP candidate, Paul Ryan, and diverse speakers like Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez, who spoke of the opportunities America afforded them. Republicans toned down their usual shrill hyperbole and petty critiques of Obama, presenting a more positive and subtle attack that may have shifted momentum in their favor. This strategic body blow may soften up Obama for the rest of the fight in a way that is not evident to casual observers. 
END OF SUMMARY.
