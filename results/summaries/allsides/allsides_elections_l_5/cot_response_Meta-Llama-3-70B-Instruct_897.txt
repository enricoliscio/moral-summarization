SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, subtly shifting momentum against President Obama. By posing as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, Republicans cleverly exploited the theme of unfulfilled expectations, lamenting the fading of hope for economic, political, and environmental change. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio delivered a "dangerous" blow to Obama's image, emphasizing his unmet promises, particularly on the environment. The GOP's tone was honed, replacing shrill hyperbole and petty critiques with a more appealing, inclusive message. Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez showcased the unique opportunities America offers, making the convention look and sound like a Democratic gathering at times. Obama's team is spinning the convention as a complete miss, but Republicans may have landed a strategic body blow, softening up the opponent for the rest of the fight. END OF SUMMARY.
