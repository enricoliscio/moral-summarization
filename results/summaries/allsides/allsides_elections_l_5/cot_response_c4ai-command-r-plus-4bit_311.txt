SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed by disappointment in President Barack Obama's unfulfilled promises and expectations. Obama's team dismissed the convention as a miss, but Republicans strategically shifted their messaging to pose as Obama 2008 voters, expressing disappointment in his failure to meet expectations. This subtle and skillful shift in tone, moving away from mocking and petty attacks, aimed to land a strategic blow on Obama by acknowledging the power of disappointment as a theme. Republicans softened their rhetoric, presenting an appealing and diverse set of speakers who highlighted the opportunities afforded to them by America. The GOP's new message sought to shift momentum and position themselves as the party that could help voters and their families, in contrast to Obama's fading hope and unfulfilled potential. This moral framing of disappointment and unfulfilled promises presents a dangerous challenge to Obama's campaign, one that his team recognizes and is working to counter.
