Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Republican National Convention and its impact on Obama's campaign. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about how the RNC was seen as a disappointment for Obama, and how the Republicans shifted their messaging to focus on Obama's unfulfilled potential.

First, I should identify the key points. The article mentions that Obama's team thought the RNC was a miss, but actually, the Republicans changed their strategy. They started to frame themselves as Obama supporters from 2008, lamenting his unfulfilled promises. This approach was more subtle and dangerous for Obama than the previous attacks.

I also need to note specific examples, like Romney's quote about Obama's promises and Rubio's comment about Obama being a bad president. The Republicans toned down the shrill attacks and focused on a more strategic, emotional appeal. They highlighted candidates like Ryan, Rubio, and Martinez to show unity and opportunities in the US.

The moral framing here is about disappointment and unfulfilled potential. The Republicans are positioning themselves as the true believers in Obama's original vision, which is a clever way to attack his performance without direct confrontation. I need to make sure the summary captures this shift in strategy and its implications.

I should keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. Start with the main idea that the RNC was a strategic shift, mention the disappointment theme, include the quotes, and conclude with the impact on the campaign. Make sure it's concise but covers all essential points without losing the moral angle.

Let me draft it step by step. Begin with the RNC's impact, then explain the shift in messaging, include the examples, and end with the significance of this approach. That should cover everything while preserving the author's moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in the GOP's approach to challenging President Obama, focusing on the theme of disappointment over his unfulfilled potential. While Obama's team initially dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans subtly reframed their messaging, positioning themselves as Obama 2008 supporters who lamented his failure to deliver on his promises. This approach, exemplified by Mitt Romney's criticism of Obama's "hope" agenda and Marco Rubio's assertion that Obama is a "bad president," aimed to shift momentum and soften Obama's image. The GOP toned down shrill attacks, instead emphasizing a more emotional appeal, with candidates like Paul Ryan, Rubio, and Susana Martinez highlighting American opportunities and unity. This subtle strategy, though not immediately obvious, poses a significant challenge to Obama's campaign by targeting his image as a leader of change. END OF SUMMARY.
