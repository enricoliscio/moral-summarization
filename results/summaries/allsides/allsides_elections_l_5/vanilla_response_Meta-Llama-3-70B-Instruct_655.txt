SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but Republicans have subtly shifted their messaging to target Obama's unfulfilled expectations and disappointment. They posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unmet promises, rather than attacking him directly. This strategy aims to soften Obama's image and shift momentum in the campaign. The convention tone was honed, with less shrill hyperbole and petty critiques, and more emphasis on appealing to seniors and minority groups. Speakers like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez presented a more moderate and inclusive face of the Republican Party. While the convention didn't land a knockout blow, it delivered a strategic body blow that could have a lasting impact on the campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
