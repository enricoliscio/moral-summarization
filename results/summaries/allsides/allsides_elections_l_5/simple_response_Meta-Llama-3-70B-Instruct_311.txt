SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations, which struck a chord with voters who feel disappointed by Obama's presidency. The convention's tone was honed, with less shrill hyperbole and petty critiques, and more emphasis on appealing to voters on a personal level. Speakers like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez shared personal stories and vowed to protect Medicare and opportunities for seniors. The moral framing of the convention was one of disappointment and unfulfilled potential, implying that Obama has not lived up to his promises. This strategy is more dangerous for Obama than previous attacks, as it taps into voters' feelings of disillusionment and may subtly shift momentum in the campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
