Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. The article is about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention and the shift in the GOP's messaging strategy. 

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It seems that the Republicans changed their approach during the convention. Instead of attacking Obama directly, they focused on the disappointment people feel about his unfulfilled promises from 2008. They tried to portray themselves as supporters of Obama's initial vision but criticized his performance. 

I should highlight that this strategy was more effective than the previous attacks because it resonated with the theme of unmet expectations. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's quotes are key here. Romney mentioned the oceans and family, while Rubio pointed out that the issue is Obama being a bad president, not a bad person. 

Also, the article notes that the convention had a softer tone, almost like a Democratic event, with candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez emphasizing family and opportunity. This shift is seen as a strategic move to gain momentum without direct, harsh attacks.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the article. I'll start by stating the shift in strategy, mention the disappointment theme, include the key quotes, and note the softer tone and its implications. 

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the shift, explain the disappointment angle, mention the candidates and their messages, and conclude with the strategic impact. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to cover all these points succinctly. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll place it between the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in the GOP's messaging, focusing on the theme of disappointment with President Barack Obama's unfulfilled potential. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans subtly reframed their attacks by posing as Obama's 2008 supporters, lamenting his failure to meet the hopes he inspired. This approach, exemplified by Mitt Romney's promise to focus on families and Marco Rubio's critique of Obama as a "bad president," aimed to shift momentum without direct, aggressive attacks. The convention also showcased a softer tone, with candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez emphasizing family values and opportunity, creating a narrative that resonated with the broader theme of unmet expectations. This strategic shift posed a more subtle but potentially dangerous challenge for Obama, as it aimed to soften him up for the remainder of the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
