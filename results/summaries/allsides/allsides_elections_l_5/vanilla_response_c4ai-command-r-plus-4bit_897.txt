SUMMARY: Obama's team is dismissing the Republican National Convention as a failure, but Republicans are shifting their messaging to appeal to disappointed Obama 2008 voters. The new strategy acknowledges that Obama's promises of hope and change have not been fulfilled, positioning Romney and Ryan as the candidates who can deliver on those promises. This subtle shift in tone, away from shrill hyperbole and towards a more positive vision, could be a dangerous strategy for Obama, as it aims to tap into the sentiment that Obama has not met the expectations of the American people. The Republican convention featured diverse speakers like Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez, and the message focused on helping families and protecting Medicare, a departure from the typical GOP platform. The challenge for Obama now is to counter this narrative and remind voters of his own vision for the country. END OF SUMMARY.
