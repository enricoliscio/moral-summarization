SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, subtly shifting momentum against President Obama. While Obama's team spun the convention as a complete miss, Republicans cleverly posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations. They acknowledged the power of the disappointment theme, highlighting the faded hope Obama offered for mending the economy, transforming politics, and saving the earth. Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio emphasized the importance of helping and protecting Americans, promising to do so in a way that resonated with voters. The convention tone was honed, replacing shrill hyperbole with a more measured approach. Prime-time speakers, like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, presented an appealing, inclusive vision, touting the unique opportunities America affords. This strategic body blow may not be immediately evident, but it sets the stage for a more effective attack on Obama's presidency in the closing months of the campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
