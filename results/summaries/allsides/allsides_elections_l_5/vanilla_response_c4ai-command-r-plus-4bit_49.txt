SUMMARY: Obama's team is dismissing the Republican National Convention as a failure that did not weaken the President's campaign. However, the convention showcased a subtle shift in the Republican strategy, focusing on portraying Obama as a disappointment to voters who had high hopes for him in 2008. This messaging recognizes that the hope and change Obama promised have not been fully realized. The GOP speakers, including Romney and Rubio, emphasized this theme, positioning themselves as Obama's 2008 voters and expressing their regret that he did not meet their expectations. This tactic is seen as more dangerous to Obama's campaign than direct attacks, as it aims to shift momentum and appeal to voters' emotions. The convention also featured an emphasis on diversity and personal stories, with Ryan, Rubio, and Martinez highlighting their connections to the American Dream and their desire to protect programs like Medicare. Despite some tough criticism of Obama, the overall tone was more positive and aimed at attracting independent voters. 

END OF SUMMARY.
