SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations, and promised to "help" Americans and their families. Sen. Marco Rubio stated that the problem with Obama is not that he's a bad person, but a bad president. The tone of the convention was honed, with shrill hyperbole and petty critiques disappearing, and instead, appealing young candidates like Paul Ryan vowed to "protect" Medicare for seniors. Cuban-American Sen. Rubio and Mexican-American Gov. Susana Martinez spoke of the unique opportunities afforded to them in the US. The convention's focus on disappointment and unfulfilled potential may be a more dangerous strategy for Obama than previous attacks. Republicans landed a strategic body blow, subtly shifting momentum and softening up Obama for the rest of the fight.

END OF SUMMARY.
