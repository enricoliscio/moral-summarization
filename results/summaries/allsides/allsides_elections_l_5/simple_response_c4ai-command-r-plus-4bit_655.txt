SUMMARY: Obama's team is brushing off the Republican National Convention as a failure, but the Republicans' new messaging strategy may pose a more significant threat to the Obama campaign than they realize. The Republicans' new tactic is to position themselves as Obama 2008 voters who are disappointed in his unfulfilled promises, acknowledging that Obama is not a bad person but a bad president. This shift in tone, away from shrill hyperbole and towards a more subtle and clever approach, could be a strategic body blow that gains them ground in the ongoing campaign battle. The Republican convention featured an appealing young VP candidate and diverse speakers, and the overall message was one of hope and potential, mirroring the very themes that once made Obama so popular. By tapping into the idea that Obama has not lived up to expectations, the Republicans are aiming for a subtle yet powerful shift in momentum. END OF SUMMARY.
