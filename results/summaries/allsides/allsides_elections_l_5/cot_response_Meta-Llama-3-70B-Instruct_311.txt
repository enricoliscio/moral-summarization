SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, landing a subtle but effective blow to President Obama's campaign. By posing as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, Republicans cleverly shifted their messaging, lamenting the unfulfilled expectations of the President's promises. Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio delivered a dangerous and appealing critique, focusing on Obama's failed delivery rather than his character. The tone was honed, shedding the shrill hyperbole and petty critiques of the past. The convention even looked and sounded like a Democratic gathering at times, with Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez highlighting the unique opportunities afforded by the United States. The Obama team is spinning the convention as a complete miss, but Republicans have successfully tapped into the powerful theme of disappointment, softening up their opponent for the rest of the fight. END OF SUMMARY.
