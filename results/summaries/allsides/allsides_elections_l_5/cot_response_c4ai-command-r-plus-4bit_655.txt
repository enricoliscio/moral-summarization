SUMMARY: 
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed by Republicans as a time to express their disappointment in President Barack Obama's unfulfilled promises and potential. This strategic shift in messaging was seen as a dangerous move by Obama's team, who viewed it as a subtle attempt to appeal to voters who had once supported Obama but were now disappointed. The Republicans aimed to portray themselves as similarly disappointed in Obama, despite their own efforts to block his policies at every turn. This moral framing of disappointment was accompanied by a toned-down approach, with less shrill hyperbole and more prime-time appeals to voters' hopes and expectations. The convention featured tough criticism of Obama's record, but also an emphasis on protecting Medicare and celebrating the opportunities afforded to minorities in leadership positions. The Republicans aimed to land a strategic blow on Obama, softening him up for the rest of the fight without resorting to jaw-dropping attacks. The subtle shift in messaging and tone presented a skillful and dangerous challenge to Obama's campaign, which now faced the task of countering this moral argument.
