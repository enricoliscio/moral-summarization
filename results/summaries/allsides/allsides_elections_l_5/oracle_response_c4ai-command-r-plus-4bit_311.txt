SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failure to land a blow on the president. The Republican strategy shifted to a more subtle and dangerous approach, acknowledging the power of the disappointment theme in Obama's unfulfilled expectations. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, expressing their lament and framing the election as a choice between helping and protecting the American people, versus saving the earth. This strategic body blow aims to shift momentum and soften Obama's position, with an appealing young VP candidate and diverse speakers who showcased the opportunities that America affords. The GOP's toned-down rhetoric and focus on protecting Medicare and individual aspirations may resonate with voters and pose a challenge to Obama's campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
