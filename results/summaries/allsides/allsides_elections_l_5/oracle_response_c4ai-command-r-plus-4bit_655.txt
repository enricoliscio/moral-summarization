SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failure to deliver any significant blows to the President's campaign. The convention marked a shift in the Republican strategy, as they posed as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging his potential but lamenting his unfulfilled promises. This messaging tactic is seen as a dangerous move by Obama's campaign, as it recognizes the power of the disappointment theme in swaying voters. The Republicans softened their tone, focusing on subtle body blows rather than knockout punches. They highlighted the gap between Obama's promises and his achievements, positioning themselves as the party that will help and protect the American people. This strategy may not be evident to casual observers, but it could shift momentum in favor of the Republicans as the campaign enters its final stages. The convention featured an appealing young vice-presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, and diverse speakers such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Susana Martinez, who emphasized the opportunities that America affords.
