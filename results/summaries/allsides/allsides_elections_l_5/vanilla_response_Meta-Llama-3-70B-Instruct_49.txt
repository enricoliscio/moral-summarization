SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle shift in GOP messaging that could be dangerous for Obama. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and promising to help families, rather than attacking him directly. This "disappointment theme" taps into the power of voters' faded hopes for Obama's presidency. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's speeches highlighted Obama's unfulfilled promises, with Rubio stating that the problem with Obama is that he's a bad president, not a bad person. The convention tone was honed, with less shrill hyperbole and petty critiques, and more prime-time moments that resembled a Democratic gathering. The GOP's strategic body blow could soften up Obama for the rest of the fight.

END OF SUMMARY.
