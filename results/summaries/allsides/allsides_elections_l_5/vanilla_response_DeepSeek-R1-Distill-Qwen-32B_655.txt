Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Republican National Convention and its impact on Obama's campaign. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article discusses how Obama's team felt the RNC was a miss, but actually, the Republicans shifted their strategy. They focused on disappointment, suggesting Obama hasn't fulfilled his 2008 promises. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio made key points about this. The Republicans toned down their attacks, making the convention seem more like a Democratic event with candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez highlighting American opportunities.

I should highlight the key points: the shift in GOP messaging, the disappointment theme, examples from Romney and Rubio, the change in tone, and the contrast with Obama's 2008 image. Also, mention how this strategy might affect Obama's campaign.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in the GOP's approach to challenging President Barack Obama. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans subtly reframed their messaging, focusing on disappointment over Obama's unfulfilled potential and promises. By posing as Obama's 2008 supporters, they criticized his performance while softening their tone, avoiding the shrill attacks of the past. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio emphasized Obama's failure to deliver on his 2008 promises, with Romney contrasting Obama's vague goals with tangible family-focused policies. The convention also highlighted Republican unity and diversity, with candidates like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez emphasizing American opportunities and unity. This new strategy, which blends criticism with a more moderate tone, poses a significant challenge to Obama's campaign as it shifts momentum and avoids direct confrontations, potentially resonating with voters who feel let down by Obama's presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
