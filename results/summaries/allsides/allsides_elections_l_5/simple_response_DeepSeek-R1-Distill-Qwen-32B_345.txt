Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Republican National Convention and its impact on Obama's campaign. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems the Republicans changed their strategy during the convention, focusing on disappointment instead of direct attacks. They portrayed themselves as Obama supporters who are let down by his performance, which is a subtle but effective approach.

I should highlight that the GOP shifted their messaging to emphasize unfulfilled expectations, using speakers like Romney and Rubio to make their points. This strategy is more dangerous for Obama because it taps into the emotional aspect of voters' hopes from 2008.

I also need to note that while there were criticisms and attacks, the convention also showcased the Republican candidates in a positive light, making them appear more relatable and effective.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key elements: the shift in strategy, the disappointment theme, the speakers' quotes, and the overall impact on Obama's campaign. I'll make sure to capture the moral angle by emphasizing the emotional and strategic aspects of the GOP's approach.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the shift in strategy, then the disappointment theme, the speakers' contributions, and conclude with the effectiveness of this approach against Obama.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in the GOP's approach to challenging President Barack Obama, focusing on the theme of disappointment. Rather than attacking Obama directly, Republicans positioned themselves as disillusioned supporters of his 2008 campaign, lamenting his unfulfilled promises. This subtle messaging, highlighted by speakers like Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, aimed to erode Obama's image as the hopeful figure voters once embraced. Romney criticized Obama's record, while Rubio emphasized his presidency's shortcomings. The GOP also showcased its candidates, such as Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez, to present a more relatable and effective image. While the convention included criticism of Obama's policies, the focus on disappointment was a more dangerous strategy for Obama, as it tapped into voters' emotional connection to his 2008 campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
