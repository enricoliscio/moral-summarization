SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, as it subtly shifted the messaging to target President Obama's unfulfilled expectations and promises. By posing as disappointed 2008 Obama voters, Republicans cleverly landed a body blow on the President's campaign. The tone was honed to be more measured, abandoning shrill hyperbole and petty critiques. Instead, they focused on the disappointment theme, lamenting Obama's failure to deliver on his promises to mend the economy, transform politics, and save the earth. The convention featured appealing speakers, including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, who spoke of the American Dream and protecting Medicare. This strategic shift in messaging poses a greater threat to Obama's campaign than previous attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
