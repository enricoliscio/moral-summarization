SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed by Obama's team as a disappointment, with Republicans posing as Obama 2008 voters and lamenting his unfulfilled expectations. This subtle shift in messaging was seen as a dangerous strategy by Obama's team, as it targeted the theme of disappointment and aimed to shift momentum in a skillful manner. Republicans toned down their usual shrill hyperbole and instead focused on mocking Obama's "you didn't build that" line and comparing his record to Jimmy Carter's. The convention featured an appealing young vice-presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, who vowed to protect Medicare for seniors, and speakers like Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez, who spoke of the unique opportunities that the United States afforded them. This softened approach by Republicans may not have been evident to casual observers, but it aimed to strategically position them better for the rest of the fight against Obama. END OF SUMMARY.
