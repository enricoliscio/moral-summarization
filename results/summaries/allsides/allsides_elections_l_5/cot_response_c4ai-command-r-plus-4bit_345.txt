SUMMARY: 
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed by disappointment in President Barack Obama's unfulfilled promises and expectations. The Republican strategy shifted to a more subtle and clever approach, posing as Obama 2008 voters and lamenting his unfulfilled potential. This strategic body blow aimed to shift momentum and subtly soften Obama's position, a dangerous move recognized by both sides. The Republican message honed in on disappointment, with a toned-down approach that disappeared into the Tampa air. The tough mockery and shrill hyperbole of Obama's every move were replaced by prime-time speeches that resembled a Democratic gathering, with appeals to saving the earth and protecting Medicare for seniors. The disappointment theme was a powerful punch, acknowledging Obama's hope for mending the economy and transforming politics, but ultimately, Republicans argued, he was a bad president. This moral framing of disappointment and missed opportunities was a key tactic in the Republican strategy, aiming to sway voters who had once fallen in love with Obama's potential.
