SUMMARY: Obama's team is dismissing the Republican National Convention as a failure that didn't lay a glove on the President. However, Republicans shifted their messaging to pose as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging his potential but lamenting his unfulfilled promises. This subtle strategy may have landed a strategic blow by framing the election as a choice between hope and help. The GOP toned down its usual hyperbole and instead focused on criticizing Obama's record and portraying him as a disappointment. The convention featured diverse speakers like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, who emphasized the opportunities America affords and vowed to protect programs like Medicare. This shift in messaging could be more dangerous for Obama than direct attacks, as it taps into the power of the disappointment theme. The challenge for Obama now is to counter this narrative and remind voters of the hope he still offers.
