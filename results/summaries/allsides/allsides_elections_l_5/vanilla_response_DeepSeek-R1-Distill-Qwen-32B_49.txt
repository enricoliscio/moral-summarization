Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user has provided the article and wants a concise summary of around 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. They're spinning it as a miss, but the Republicans actually shifted their strategy. Instead of attacking Obama with kitchen-sink tactics, they focused on disappointmentâ€”how Obama hasn't fulfilled his 2008 promises. They portrayed themselves as Obama supporters who are let down, which is a clever move.

Key points to include:
- Republicans' new strategy: emphasizing disappointment and unfulfilled potential.
- Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's statements highlighting this theme.
- The shift in tone from previous attacks to a more subtle approach.
- The convention's appeal with candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez, making it seem almost like a Democratic event.

I need to condense this into a summary that captures the essence without getting bogged down in details. I should make sure it's under 200 words and flows well. Let me structure it to first mention Obama's team's view, then the Republican strategy, the specific examples, and the overall impact of the convention.

SUMMARY: Obama's team dismissed the Republican National Convention in Tampa as a failure, but Republicans subtly shifted their strategy to focus on disappointment, targeting Obama's unfulfilled potential from 2008. Instead of direct attacks, they portrayed themselves as Obama supporters who were let down, emphasizing his failure to deliver on promises. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio highlighted this theme, with Romney contrasting Obama's grandiose promises with practical family support. The convention's tone shifted from shrill critiques to a more nuanced approach, with candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez appealing to voters with messages that echoed Democratic values. While Obama's team downplayed the impact, the GOP's strategic shift posed a significant challenge by softening Obama's image and setting up a more calculated campaign strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
