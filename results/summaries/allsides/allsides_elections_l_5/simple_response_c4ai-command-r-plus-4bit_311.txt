SUMMARY: Obamaâ€™s team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failure that did not lay a glove on their candidate. However, Republicans shifted their messaging to pose as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, a more dangerous and subtle strategy. This shift recognizes that the hope Obama offered for mending the economy, transforming politics, and saving the planet has faded. The Republican message in Tampa focused on portraying Obama as a disappointment, a shift from the shrill hyperbole and petty critiques that preceded the convention. This strategic body blow aims to gain better position and soften up Obama, despite the Obama team's claims that the convention was a miss. The GOP's tone was honed, and the gathering even resembled a Democratic convention at times, with its diverse speakers and appeals to a wide range of voters. This new moral framing of the race poses a challenge to Obama, who must now defend himself against the charge of disappointment. END OF SUMMARY.
