Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Republican National Convention and how it was a strategic move against Obama. The key moral frames here are disappointment, unfulfilled potential, betrayal, and failure. 

The article mentions that the GOP shifted their messaging to focus on how Obama didn't meet the expectations he set in 2008. They used rhetoric that made it seem like they were disappointed Obama supporters, which is a clever tactic. Words like "disappointment," "unfulfilled potential," "betrayal," and "failure" are central to the moral framing. 

I also notice that the Republicans presented themselves as if they were part of Obama's base, which adds to the moral critique. They criticized his policies, like the economy and healthcare, but also attacked his character by suggesting he's a bad president. 

In the summary, I need to include these morally charged words to reflect the author's framing. I should mention the strategic shift in messaging, the disappointment theme, and how the Republicans positioned themselves as Obama's supporters. Also, highlighting specific examples like Romney and Rubio's statements will help convey the moral critique.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start by stating the main point about the GOP's strategic shift, then discuss the disappointment theme, followed by specific examples and the impact of this messaging. Finally, I'll conclude with the potential implications for Obama's campaign.

Let me structure this step by step. First, identify the key morally framed words: disappointment, unfulfilled, betrayal, failure, bad person, bad president. Then, in the summary, weave these into a coherent narrative that shows how the Republicans used these frames to their advantage. Make sure each sentence connects logically to the next, maintaining the moral critique throughout.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary moral framing elements.

**Summary:**

The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in messaging against President Obama, focusing on the theme of disappointment. Republicans portrayed themselves as Obama's 2008 supporters, lamenting his unfulfilled potential and framing him as a "bad president." This approach aimed to highlight his failure to meet expectations, particularly regarding the economy and healthcare. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio emphasized this critique, with Romney contrasting Obama's promises with tangible family support and Rubio questioning Obama's leadership. The GOP's subtle, strategic messaging sought to shift momentum, positioning themselves as the party of hope and opportunity, while criticizing Obama's policies and character. This approach posed a significant challenge to Obama's campaign, as it resonated with voters' disillusionment and aimed to soften his image in the lead-up to the election.
