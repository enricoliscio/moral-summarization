Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, okay, let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by saying Obama's team is spinning the RNC as a miss. They think the Republicans didn't land any real blows. But the author points out that the Republicans shifted their strategy. Instead of attacking Obama directly, they focused on disappointmentâ€”how he hasn't fulfilled his 2008 promises. That's a clever move because it taps into people's feelings about unmet expectations.

The author mentions specific examples like Romney and Rubio. Romney talks about Obama's promises on the environment, and Rubio says the problem isn't that Obama is a bad person, but a bad president. This approach is more strategic, aiming to subtly shift momentum without direct attacks.

The article also notes that the RNC had a softer tone, almost like a Democratic convention, with candidates talking about family and Medicare. This contrast is important because it shows the Republicans trying to appeal more broadly.

I need to make sure the summary captures this shift in strategy and the moral framing around disappointment and unfulfilled potential. It should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight how the Republicans' approach is more dangerous for Obama than direct attacks.

Let me structure it: start with the main point that Republicans focused on disappointment, mention the examples, explain the strategic shift, and conclude with the impact on Obama's campaign. I should keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed as a strategic shift in messaging that targeted President Barack Obama's unfulfilled potential, a theme that resonated deeply with voters. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," the Republicans subtly positioned themselves as Obama's 2008 supporters, lamenting his failure to deliver on promises of hope and change. This approach, exemplified by Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, aimed to highlight Obama's disappointment as a leader, rather than attacking him directly. Romney criticized Obama's environmental promises, while Rubio emphasized Obama's shortcomings as a president. The GOP's tone shifted from shrill attacks to a more nuanced, empathetic narrative, even incorporating Democratic-style rhetoric about family and Medicare. This strategic shift, though not immediately impactful, posed a more subtle and dangerous challenge to Obama's campaign, as it sought to soften his image and shift momentum in the race. END OF SUMMARY.
