SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging that poses a greater threat to Obama's campaign. Republicans strategically employed a "disappointment" theme, lamenting Obama's unfulfilled expectations and promises, rather than attacking him directly. This approach allowed them to appear as if they had been with Obama all along, rather than trying to block him. The tone of the convention was honed, with shrill hyperbole and petty critiques giving way to a more measured and appealing approach. The GOP's focus on disappointment has the potential to resonate with voters and undermine Obama's campaign. By acknowledging Obama's initial appeal and expressing disappointment in his presidency, Republicans may be able to capitalize on the perception that he has failed to deliver on his promises.

END OF SUMMARY.
