Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention. The article talks about how the RNC focused on disappointment with Obama, highlighting unfulfilled expectations from 2008. They used subtle messaging instead of direct attacks. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio made specific points about Obama's promises versus their own. The Republicans tried to shift their tone to appear more positive and relatable, almost like a Democratic convention, with speeches from Paul Ryan, Rubio, and Susana Martinez. The article suggests this strategy might be more effective than the usual attacks because it targets Obama's image as a uniter.

I should start by identifying the main points: the disappointment theme, subtle messaging, specific quotes from Romney and Rubio, the shift in tone, and the impact on Obama's campaign. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first mentioning the RNC's focus, then the strategy, followed by examples of their messaging, and conclude with the potential effectiveness of this approach.
