SUMMARY: Obama's team is dismissing the Republican National Convention as a failure, claiming that Republicans did not effectively criticize their candidate. However, the convention saw a subtle shift in the GOP's messaging, focusing on portraying themselves as disappointed Obama 2008 voters. This strategy acknowledges the power of the disappointment theme, recognizing that the hope Obama once offered has faded. The new approach, exemplified by quotes from Romney, Rubio, Ryan, and Martinez, aims to soften up Obama without appearing overly critical to casual observers. While there was still tough criticism and mockery of Obama, the convention also featured diverse speakers and a more positive, inclusive tone from the Republican Party. This strategy may prove more effective in the long run than the previous "kitchen-sink" attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
