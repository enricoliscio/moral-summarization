SUMMARY: Obama's team is brushing off the Republican National Convention, claiming it didn't impact the President. However, the convention marked a subtle but clever shift in the Republican messaging strategy, which may prove more dangerous for Obama's campaign than previous aggressive attacks. The new approach involves posing as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled promises and portraying themselves as having supported him all along. This tactic recognizes the power of the disappointment theme, acknowledging that the hope Obama once offered has faded. Republicans softened their tone, with prime-time speakers like Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez presenting a more positive and inclusive vision for the future, reminiscent of Obama's 2008 campaign. This strategic shift aims to subtly shift momentum and gain an advantage over Obama, and it will be interesting to see how effective it proves in the remaining months of the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
