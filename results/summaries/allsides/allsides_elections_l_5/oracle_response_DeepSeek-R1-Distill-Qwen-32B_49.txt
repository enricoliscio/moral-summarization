Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally framed words like "help" and "protect." Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Republican National Convention and how Obama's team felt it was a miss. However, the Republicans shifted their strategy to focus on disappointment, suggesting that Obama didn't fulfill his 2008 promises. They used rhetoric to position themselves as Obama supporters who are now disappointed, which is a clever move.

I need to make sure I include the moral words "help" and "protect." Looking back, Paul Ryan mentioned protecting Medicare, so that's one. Romney's promise to help families is another. I should structure the summary to highlight how the Republicans changed their approach, focusing on disappointment and using these moral terms.

I should also mention the contrast between the convention's tough criticisms and the more empathetic tone, especially during prime time. This shows the strategic shift. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence without losing the moral framing.

Let me draft it, making sure to include those key points and the specific moral terms. I'll start by stating the shift in strategy, mention the disappointment theme, include Romney and Ryan's statements, and conclude with the impact on Obama's campaign.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa marked a strategic shift in GOP messaging, focusing on the theme of disappointment with President Barack Obama. Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, refrained from direct attacks and instead positioned themselves as Obama's 2008 supporters, lamenting his unfulfilled potential. Romney promised to "help" families, while Rubio criticized Obama's presidency rather than his character. The convention's tone softened, with rhetoric resembling a Democratic gathering, as Paul Ryan vowed to "protect" Medicare and Rubio highlighted American opportunities. While there were criticisms of Obama's policies, the GOP's subtle approach aimed to shift momentum and weaken Obama's campaign. This strategic move, avoiding overt attacks, posed a more dangerous challenge for Obama, as it resonated with the narrative of unmet expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
