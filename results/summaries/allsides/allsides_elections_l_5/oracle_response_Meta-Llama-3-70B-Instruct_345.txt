SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but a closer look reveals a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging that could pose a threat to Obama's campaign. Republicans have adopted a tone of disappointment, lamenting Obama's unfulfilled expectations and promising to "help" and "protect" Americans. This approach is more dangerous to Obama than previous attacks, as it taps into the widespread feeling of disappointment with his presidency. Romney and Rubio's speeches, in particular, struck a conciliatory tone, with Rubio praising Obama as a person while criticizing his presidency. The convention's focus on "help" and "protection" could resonate with voters, especially seniors and minorities, who were inspired by Obama's 2008 message of hope and change. If Republicans can maintain this tone, they may be able to capitalize on the disappointment theme and gain momentum in the campaign.
