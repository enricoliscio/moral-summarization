SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, subtly shifting the momentum against President Obama. By posing as disappointed 2008 Obama voters, Republicans cleverly exploited the theme of unfulfilled expectations, lamenting the fading of hope for economic, political, and environmental change. This approach was more dangerous for Obama than previous attacks, as it struck at the heart of his appeal. Republicans honed their tone, replacing shrill hyperbole with a more measured criticism, and even borrowed Democratic themes, such as protecting Medicare and celebrating the American Dream. The convention's prime-time speakers, including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, presented an appealing, inclusive face, further eroding Obama's advantage. While Obama's team spun the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans landed a strategic body blow, softening up the opponent for the rest of the fight.

END OF SUMMARY.
