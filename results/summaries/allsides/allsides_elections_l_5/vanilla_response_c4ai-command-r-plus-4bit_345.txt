SUMMARY: Republicans at the RNC in Tampa shifted their messaging to pose as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging his potential but criticizing his unfulfilled promises. This strategy, recognized as dangerous by Obama's team, aims to soften his image and appeal to voters' emotions. The GOP toned down their usual hyperbole and instead focused on portraying a more positive, inclusive vision for the future, with an emphasis on individual opportunity and protecting programs like Medicare. This subtle shift in messaging is seen as a strategic body blow to Obama's campaign, attempting to shift momentum and gain a better position for the rest of the fight. The GOP's new approach may signal a more nuanced and disciplined line of attack that could resonate with voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
