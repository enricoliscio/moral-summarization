SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and disappointment, rather than attacking him directly. This strategy is more dangerous for Obama as it taps into the widespread feeling of disappointment with his presidency. Romney and other Republicans honed their tone, abandoning shrill hyperbole and petty critiques, and instead focused on the unfulfilled promises of Obama's 2008 campaign. The convention featured appealing speakers, including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, who spoke about opportunities and protecting seniors. The GOP's new approach is a strategic body blow that may not be immediately evident but could gain momentum in the closing months of the campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
