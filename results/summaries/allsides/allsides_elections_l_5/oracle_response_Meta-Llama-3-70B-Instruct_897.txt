SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging has emerged. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations, which is a more dangerous strategy for Obama than previous attacks. They acknowledged the power of the disappointment theme, that the hope Obama offered has faded. Romney and Rubio's speeches emphasized the importance of helping and protecting Americans, with Rubio stating "Our problem with President Obama isn’t that he’s a bad person. Our problem is that he’s a bad president." The tone of the convention was honed, with petty critiques and hyperbole disappearing, and instead, an appealing young vice-presidential candidate and minority leaders spoke of the unique opportunities afforded to them in the US. This shift in messaging may subtly soften up Obama's campaign and gain momentum for the Republicans.
