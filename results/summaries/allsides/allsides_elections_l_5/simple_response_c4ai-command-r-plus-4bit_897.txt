SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failure that did not lay a glove on their candidate. However, Republicans shifted their messaging to pose as disappointed Obama 2008 voters, acknowledging that the hope and potential he once represented have faded. This strategy is more dangerous than kitchen-sink attacks, as it targets the very foundation of Obama's campaign: the promise of change and a better future. By acknowledging Obama's positive qualities and expressing their own disappointment, Republicans are attempting to undermine Obama's message of hope and present themselves as the true agents of change. This subtle shift in tone, from shrill hyperbole to a more subdued and thoughtful critique, may be more effective in swaying undecided voters and softening up Obama's support base. The challenge for Obama now lies in countering this narrative of disappointment and unfulfilled expectations. END OF SUMMARY.
