SUMMARY: Obama's team is brushing off the Republican National Convention as a failure, but the reality is that the GOP delivered a subtle and clever shift in messaging that could pose a greater threat to the president's reelection campaign. The new strategy involves posing as Obama 2008 voters and expressing disappointment in his unfulfilled promises, acknowledging that he is "not a bad person" but "a bad president." This tactic is more dangerous than previous kitchen-sink attacks because it taps into the power of disappointment and unfulfilled potential, a theme that both sides recognize as potent. Republicans softened their tone, and while there was still tough criticism and mockery of Obama's policies, the convention at times resembled a Democratic gathering with its focus on personal stories and appeals to a diverse audience. This strategic shift may not be evident to casual observers, but it represents a skillful body blow that could shift momentum in the campaign.
END OF SUMMARY.
