Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Obama's team is spinning the RNC as a miss, but the Republicans actually managed to shift their messaging in a way that's more dangerous for Obama. They focused on disappointment, suggesting that Obama hasn't lived up to his 2008 promises. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio are mentioned as examples, highlighting the contrast between Obama's unfulfilled potential and their own promises.

I should note that the Republicans didn't use the usual aggressive attacks but instead presented themselves as Obama supporters who are disappointed. This subtle approach is seen as a strategic move to shift momentum. The article also mentions that while there was criticism, the convention had a more positive tone, with speakers like Paul Ryan and others emphasizing opportunity and unity.

So, the key points are: Obama's team downplays the convention's impact, but Republicans effectively used disappointment as a theme, shifted their messaging to a more strategic approach, and presented a more positive image. I need to capture these points concisely, making sure to include the main speakers and the overall strategy without getting into too much detail.

I should structure the summary to first mention Obama's team's reaction, then explain the Republican strategy, and finally touch on the convention's tone and the implications. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise and avoid unnecessary details.

Let me draft a few sentences: "Obama's team dismissed the Republican National Convention as a failure, but the GOP effectively shifted their strategy to focus on disappointment with Obama's unfulfilled promises. Speakers like Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio criticized Obama's performance, positioning themselves as disappointed supporters. This subtle approach aimed to soften Obama's image and shift momentum, rather than using direct attacks. The convention also showcased a more positive tone, with speakers like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez emphasizing opportunity and unity, signaling a strategic shift in the campaign."

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down. Maybe combine some points: "Obama's team portrayed the RNC as a failure, but Republicans strategically focused on disappointment with Obama's unfulfilled promises. Romney and Rubio criticized Obama, positioning themselves as disappointed supporters. This subtle approach aimed to shift momentum without direct attacks. The convention also highlighted a positive tone, with speakers like Ryan and Martinez emphasizing opportunity, signaling a strategic shift in the campaign."

That's better, but still a bit wordy. Let me try again: "Obama's team dismissed the RNC as a failure, but Republicans shifted to focus on disappointment with Obama's unfulfilled 2008 promises. Romney and Rubio criticized Obama, positioning themselves as disappointed supporters. This strategic approach aimed to shift momentum, not through direct attacks but by highlighting unmet expectations. The convention also featured a more positive tone, with speakers like Ryan and Martinez emphasizing opportunity, signaling a shift in the GOP's campaign strategy."

Yes, that's concise and covers all the main points. I think this should be under 200 words and effectively summarize the article.
