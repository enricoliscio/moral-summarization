SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it marked a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and disappointment, rather than attacking him directly. This strategy is more dangerous for Obama than previous attacks, as it subtly shifts momentum and softens him up for the rest of the fight. The tone of the convention was honed, with petty critiques and shrill hyperbole disappearing, replaced by appealing speeches from young candidates like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio. The GOP's new message is that Obama is a bad president, not a bad person, and that he has failed to fulfill his promises, including slowing the rise of the oceans and healing the planet. This moral framing of disappointment and unfulfilled expectations may prove to be a powerful blow to Obama's campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
