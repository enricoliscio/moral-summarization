SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was a strategic success, landing a subtle but effective blow to President Obama's campaign. By shifting their tone, Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and disappointment. This clever move allowed them to capitalize on the power of the disappointment theme, highlighting the faded hope of Obama's promises to mend the economy, transform politics, and save the earth. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio delivered clever critiques, acknowledging Obama's good intentions but labeling him a "bad president." The convention's tone was honed, replacing shrill hyperbole and petty critiques with an appealing and inclusive message. The result was a Democratic-sounding gathering that left Obama's team spinning the event as a complete miss. END OF SUMMARY.
