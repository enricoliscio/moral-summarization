SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was framed by Barack Obama's team as a disappointment. The convention was seen as a strategic body blow to Obama's campaign, a subtle and clever shift in GOP messaging that posed a dangerous challenge to Obama's reelection. Republicans aimed to portray themselves as Obama 2008 voters, expressing disappointment in his unfulfilled expectations. This shift in tone, away from shrill hyperbole and petty criticism, was designed to soften up Obama for the rest of the fight, and it may not be evident to casual observers. The Republican strategy was to gain a better position by portraying Obama as a disappointment, a skillful pugilist move that landed a punch without a roundhouse or jaw-splitter knockout. The convention featured an appealing, young, vice-presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, who vowed to protect Medicare for seniors, and showcased the unique opportunities that the United States afforded to Cuban-American and Mexican-American leaders, Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez, to rise into leadership positions. Republicans recognize the power of the disappointment theme, acknowledging that the hope and promise offered by Obama have faded.
