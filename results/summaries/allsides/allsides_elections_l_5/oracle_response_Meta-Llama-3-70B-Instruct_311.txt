SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, it was a strategic move that subtly shifted the momentum in favor of the Republicans. The GOP's new approach is to pose as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and promising to "help" Americans and their families. This clever strategy is more dangerous for Obama than the previous attacks, as it taps into the disappointment theme that the hope Obama offered in 2008 has faded. Republicans like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio presented themselves as appealing leaders who want to "protect" Medicare for seniors and provide opportunities for all Americans to rise into leadership positions. The convention's tone was honed to be more positive and inclusive, with less shrill hyperbole and petty critiques. This shift in messaging may not be immediately apparent, but it could have a significant impact on the campaign's outcome.

END OF SUMMARY.
