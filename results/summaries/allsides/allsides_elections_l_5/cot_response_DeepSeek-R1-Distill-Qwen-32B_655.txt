Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama and the Republican National Convention. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral frames. 

Starting with the first step, I should read through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "disappointment," "spin," "challenge," "hammer," "mock," "demand," "laugh," "pine," "disingenuous," "shiver," "miss," "landed," "punch," "strategic," "body blow," "shift," "momentum," "soften," "observer," "shrill," "hyperbole," "petty," "intransigence," "appealing," "vowed," "protect," "unique," "opportunities," "afforded." These words seem to carry moral or evaluative meanings.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words while keeping those moral terms. The article talks about how the RNC tried to shift their messaging to focus on disappointment with Obama, moving away from direct attacks to a more subtle strategy. They portrayed themselves as Obama supporters who are disappointed, which was effective. The summary should highlight this shift and the impact on Obama's campaign.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning the disappointment theme, the strategic shift, the use of rhetorical tactics, and the overall effect on the campaign dynamics. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate without making the summary too long.

Let me check if I included all the necessary points: the RNC's strategy, the disappointment angle, the change in tone from criticism to a more empathetic approach, and the potential long-term effects on the campaign. I think that covers the main points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  

The Republican National Convention in Tampa focused on the theme of disappointment, targeting President Barack Obama's unfulfilled potential and promises. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans subtly shifted their messaging to portray themselves as Obama 2008 supporters, lamenting his failure to deliver on his campaign promises. This strategic approach aimed to soften Obama's image and shift momentum in their favor. GOP speakers, including Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, criticized Obama's record while emphasizing their own promises to improve American lives. The convention also showcased a more empathetic tone, with speakers like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez highlighting the opportunities the U.S. provides. This subtle rhetorical shift marked a departure from direct attacks, instead focusing on a narrative of unmet expectations. The Republican strategy sought to gain an advantage by appealing to voters' dissatisfaction with Obama's leadership, while avoiding the shrill hyperbole of past critiques.
