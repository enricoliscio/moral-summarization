Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's team reacting to the Republican National Convention. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about how the RNC focused on disappointment with Obama, highlighting unfulfilled promises and shifting the GOP message to align with his 2008 supporters. 

First, I should identify the key points: the RNC's strategy of disappointment, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's statements, the shift in tone from Republicans, and the potential impact on Obama's campaign. I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angle, which is the disappointment theme and how it's a strategic move against Obama.

I should start by mentioning the RNC's focus on disappointment, then explain how Republicans portrayed themselves as Obama's supporters, and the specific examples like Romney and Rubio. Then, note the shift in tone and the strategic body blow metaphor. Finally, conclude with the potential long-term effects on the campaign.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: introduce the strategy, explain the messaging, give examples, discuss the shift in tone, and conclude with the impact. Make sure to highlight the moral framing around disappointment and unfulfilled potential.

Alright, let me draft that.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa focused on a strategic shift in messaging, targeting President Obama's unfulfilled potential and disappointing voters. While Obama's team dismissed the convention as a "complete miss," Republicans subtly positioned themselves as Obama's 2008 supporters, lamenting his unmet promises. This approach aimed to resonate with voters who once embraced Obama's hope for change. Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio emphasized Obama's failure to deliver on his 2008 promises, framing the issue as a moral letdown. The GOP's tone softened, avoiding shrill critiques, and instead showcased candidates like Paul Ryan and Susana Martinez to appeal to Obama's base. This subtle strategy, described as a "strategic body blow," seeks to shift momentum and soften Obama for the remainder of the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
