SUMMARY:

The Republican National Convention in Tampa has been spun by Obama's team as a complete miss, but in reality, the GOP has shifted its messaging strategy to pose as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations. This "disappointment theme" targets the fading hope Obama offered in 2008, including promises to mend the economy, transform politics, and save the earth. Republicans, such as Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, have honed their tone, moving away from shrill hyperbole and petty critiques. Instead, they have adopted a more subtle approach, focusing on Obama's unfulfilled potential and promising to help individuals and families. The convention featured appealing speakers, including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, and Susana Martinez, who spoke about opportunities and protecting Medicare. This strategic shift in messaging may not be immediately apparent but could gain momentum in the closing months of the campaign.
