SUMMARY:
The Republican National Convention in Tampa was deemed a success by the GOP, despite Obama's team spinning it as a complete miss. Republicans cleverly shifted their messaging, adopting a more subtle and dangerous strategy that focused on disappointment. They posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations and promising a more humble, achievable agenda. Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio delivered speeches that were more in line with Democratic values, touting the unique opportunities afforded by the United States. The tone was appealing, with a focus on protecting Medicare for seniors and honoring role models. The GOP's new approach is a strategic body blow to Obama's campaign, softening him up for the rest of the fight. END OF SUMMARY.
