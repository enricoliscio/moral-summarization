Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the Republican National Convention and how it affected Obama's campaign. The key points are the disappointment theme, the shift in GOP messaging, and the strategic approach they took.

First, I'll identify the main elements: the disappointment narrative, the GOP's rhetorical shift, and the impact on Obama's team. I should highlight how Republicans positioned themselves as Obama supporters from 2008, lamenting his unfulfilled potential. This is a strategic move to contrast with the previous aggressive attacks.

I also need to mention specific examples, like Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's statements, to show the new messaging. The article contrasts this with the more aggressive tactics from earlier, so I should note that shift.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by explaining the overall effect on the campaign, emphasizing that the GOP's approach was subtle but effective in shifting momentum. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing as presented.

SUMMARY: The Republican National Convention in Tampa was marked by a strategic shift in messaging aimed at Obama, focusing on disappointment and unfulfilled potential. Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, positioned themselves as Obama 2008 supporters, lamenting his failure to deliver on his promises, rather than attacking him directly. This approach was seen as more dangerous for Obama than previous aggressive tactics, as it subtly shifted momentum and softened his image. The convention also featured a toned-down tone, with less hyperbole and more focus on personal stories, such as Paul Ryan's appeal and Rubio's emphasis on American opportunities. While there were criticisms of Obama's policies, the overall narrative aimed to contrast his perceived failure with the GOP's vision of hope and renewal. Obama's team dismissed the convention as a miss, but the GOP's subtle strategy may have long-term implications in the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
