SUMMARY: Obama's team is spinning the Republican National Convention as a failed attempt to discredit the President. The disappointment theme, which recognizes that the hope Obama offered for improving the economy and politics has faded, is a dangerous strategy for Obama's campaign. Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, expressing lament for his unfulfilled expectations. This shift in messaging was subtle and clever, and it may have landed a strategic blow to Obama's campaign. The GOP's toned-down rhetoric and focus on protecting Medicare and celebrating the opportunities that America affords were more reminiscent of a Democratic gathering. The challenge for Obama now is to counter the disappointment message and remind voters of the hope he represents.

END OF SUMMARY.
