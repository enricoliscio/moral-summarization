SUMMARY: The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, following the Supreme Court's ruling against DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management detailed these benefits in a letter to executive departments, stating that legally married same-sex spouses should have the same access as heterosexual couples. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder expressed their support for the expansion of benefits, stating that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also announced that the Pentagon will work to expand benefits for same-sex couples. The changes are expected to have a positive impact on the lives of many, and the Department of Justice is coordinating with agencies to implement the ruling swiftly and smoothly.
END OF SUMMARY.
