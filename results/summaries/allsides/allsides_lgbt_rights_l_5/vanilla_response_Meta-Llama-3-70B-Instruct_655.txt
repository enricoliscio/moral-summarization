SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance, retirement accounts, and vision benefits, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance to executive departments and agencies, stating that legally married same-sex spouses will have access to the same benefits as heterosexual couples. The administration appears to be taking the stance that couples will have access to benefits regardless of the state in which they live. President Obama has applauded the expansion of access to federal benefits, stating that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, and other federal agencies, including the Pentagon, are also moving to expand benefits to same-sex couples.

END OF SUMMARY.
