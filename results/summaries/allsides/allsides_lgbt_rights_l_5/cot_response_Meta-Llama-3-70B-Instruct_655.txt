SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move ensures that all married couples, gay and straight, are treated equally under federal law. President Barack Obama hailed the expansion of access to federal benefits, stating that thousands of gays and lesbians serving in the federal government deserve the same respect and protection as every other family. The administration is working to implement the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, with the Justice Department leading the effort. Attorney General Eric Holder welcomed the announcement, saying it will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many. The changes will provide equal protection and equal treatment under the law, fulfilling the promise of the landmark Supreme Court decision. END OF SUMMARY.
