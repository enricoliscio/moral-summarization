Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words. Let me read through the article to identify the key points.

The article talks about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This change came two days after the Supreme Court struck down a part of DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sent a memo detailing these benefits, including vision and long-term care insurance. It also mentions that the memo doesn't specify state laws, implying benefits are available regardless of where they live. President Obama supports this, and other officials like Holder and Hagel back the move, emphasizing equality and legal implementation.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the administration's decision, the benefits offered, the Supreme Court ruling context, OPM's memo details, state laws consideration, Obama's stance, and support from other officials. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essentials without too much detail.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the administration's announcement, mention the benefits, reference the DOMA ruling, explain OPM's memo, note the state laws aspect, include Obama's comments, and conclude with the support from other officials. I should ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding jargon where possible.

I'll also check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Once the summary is ready, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health insurance, retirement accounts, and vision care, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo detailing these benefits, ensuring legally married same-sex couples have the same access as heterosexual couples. While the memo does not explicitly address couples living in states where same-sex marriage is not recognized, it emphasizes that benefits are available to all legally married couples. President Obama supports treating same-sex couples as married nationwide, and the administration is working on the legal implications. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Attorney General Eric Holder have also backed the move, highlighting the importance of equality and legal implementation. The changes aim to provide equal treatment for federal employees and their families, regardless of marriage type. END OF SUMMARY.
