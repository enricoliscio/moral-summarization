SUMMARY: Following the Supreme Court's historic ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act, the Obama administration has acted swiftly to ensure equal treatment for all legally married couples, regardless of sexual orientation. This includes granting same-sex spouses of federal employees access to a range of benefits, such as health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, as well as retirement accounts. The move has been praised by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder as a step towards equality and respect for all families. It sends a powerful message that all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal protection and treatment under the law. The expansion of benefits will have a tangible impact on the lives of many, and the administration is committed to ensuring a smooth and swift implementation process. The President also acknowledged the complexity of recognizing same-sex marriages performed in one state but not in another, and his administration is working to address these legal complexities. This marks a significant step forward in the fight for equal rights and sends a message of inclusion and fairness for all Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
