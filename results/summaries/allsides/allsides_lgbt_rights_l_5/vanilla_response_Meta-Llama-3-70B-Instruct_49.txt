SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, effective immediately. This comes two days after the Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance detailing access to benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, which will be available to legally married same-sex spouses. The administration appears to be taking the stance that couples will have access to these benefits regardless of the state in which they live. President Obama has applauded the expansion of access to federal benefits, stating that it is a critical first step towards implementing the Supreme Court's decision. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, and the Pentagon will also move quickly to expand benefits to same-sex couples.
