SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, immediately following the Supreme Court's overturn of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move is a "critical first step" towards implementing the landmark decision, ensuring that all married couples, gay and straight, are treated equally under federal law. President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working on the legalities of making this a reality. The expansion of access to federal benefits is a step towards providing equal respect and protection to all families, regardless of sexual orientation. The Justice Department will continue to coordinate with other federal agencies to implement this ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible. This change will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many. END OF SUMMARY.
