Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This comes after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing these benefits, including vision and dental insurance. They didn't specify state laws, implying benefits apply nationwide. President Obama supports this, saying all married couples should be treated equally. Other officials like Holder and Hagel also support it, emphasizing equal treatment and protection.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Looking through the article, words like "benefits," "respect," "protection," "equality," "equal treatment," "equal protection," "landmark," "critical," "promise," "meaningful," "positive," "just," "fair," "deserve," "entitled," "expanded," "expanded access," "expanded benefits," "expanded rights," "expanded protections," "expanded respect," "expanded treatment," "expanded justice," "expanded equality," "expanded fairness," "expanded dignity," "expanded rights," "expanded respect," "expanded treatment," "expanded justice," "expanded equality," "expanded fairness," "expanded dignity" come to mind. These words carry moral weight, highlighting justice, fairness, and equality.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral aspects. I'll mention the Obama administration's move, the benefits available, the Supreme Court's decision, and the administration's stance on equal treatment. I'll include the officials' support and the positive impact on families. I'll make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it too long.

I should start with the main action, then the context, followed by the implications and support. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's clear and concise while emphasizing the moral aspects like equality and respect.
