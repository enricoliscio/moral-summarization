SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has taken swift action to ensure that same-sex spouses of federal employees have equal access to benefits following the Supreme Court's historic ruling on DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management has outlined that legally married same-sex couples will now have the right to the same benefits as heterosexual couples, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This decision affirms the rights and protection of all legally married couples, regardless of the state they live in. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have applauded this move as a critical step towards ensuring equal treatment and respect for all families. This expansion of benefits is a positive step forward, offering meaningful change for thousands of federal employees and their families. The administration is committed to ensuring the swift and smooth implementation of these changes, working to guarantee that all married couples are treated fairly and with dignity under federal law.
