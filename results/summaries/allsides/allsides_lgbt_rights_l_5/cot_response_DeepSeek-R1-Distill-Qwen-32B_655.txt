Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Obama administration extending federal benefits to same-sex spouses after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. Benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts are now available.

The user has two steps: first, identify morally framed words, and second, write a summary preserving those words. For the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral weight. Words like "benefits," "respect," "equality," "discrimination," "entitlement," "equal protection," "equality," "fairness," "justice," "discrimination," "respect," and "equal treatment" stand out as they relate to moral principles.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. I'll make sure to mention the administration's actions, the benefits extended, and the moral reasoning behind it, such as equality and justice. I should keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while highlighting the moral aspects.

I'll start by stating the administration's decision, then list the benefits. I'll mention the Supreme Court ruling and DOMA repeal. Then, I'll include quotes from Obama and Holder to emphasize the moral stance on equality and justice. I'll conclude by noting the departments involved and the ongoing efforts to implement the ruling.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and includes all key points without being too verbose. Also, I should maintain the moral framing by using the identified words appropriately. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each part flows logically into the next.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all morally framed words are included where appropriate. This should provide a comprehensive yet concise summary that reflects the article's moral underpinnings.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Obama administration has extended federal benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, to same-sex spouses of federal employees, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued guidance ensuring legally married same-sex couples have equal access to benefits like health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. While the memo does not explicitly address couples living in states where same-sex marriage is not recognized, it emphasizes that benefits are available to all legally married couples, regardless of state laws. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder praised the move, highlighting the importance of equality and justice for same-sex couples and their families. The Department of Justice and Pentagon are working to implement the repeal of DOMA's Section 3, ensuring federal employees and their families receive fair treatment under the law. END OF SUMMARY.
