SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move ensures that same-sex couples will have equal access to benefits as heterosexual married couples. President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working to make this a reality. The expansion of benefits is a critical first step towards implementing the landmark Supreme Court decision, which declares that all married couples - gay and straight - should be treated equally under federal law. This change will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, and the Department of Justice will continue to coordinate with other federal agencies to implement the ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible.
