SUMMARY: The Obama administration has taken a historic step towards equality by extending federal benefits to same-sex spouses of federal employees, just days after the Supreme Court's ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act. This courageous decision sends a powerful message of fairness and respect to the LGBT community, finally recognizing their right to equal treatment under the law. Health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance benefits will now be accessible to these spouses, regardless of the state's stance on same-sex marriage. The move has been applauded by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, who emphasized the importance of treating all married couples equally, regardless of sexual orientation. This is a significant step forward in ensuring that all Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and it sets a moral standard for the nation to follow. It is a triumph for equality and a testament to the Obama administration's commitment to social justice. END OF SUMMARY.
