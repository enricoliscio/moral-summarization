Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Obama administration expanding benefits to same-sex spouses of federal employees after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA.

I notice the user provided a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. Words like "available," "access," "married," "treated equally," "deserve," "respect," and "protection" stand out. These terms highlight the moral aspects of equal rights and justice.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should start with the key action: benefits now available to same-sex spouses. Mention the Supreme Court's decision overturning DOMA. Then, detail the specific benefits like health, vision insurance, and retirement accounts. Highlight President Obama's support and the administration's efforts to ensure equal treatment regardless of state laws.

I also need to include the reactions from the Attorney General and the positive impact these changes will have. Make sure to use words like "expand," "implementation," and "meaningful difference" to maintain the moral tone.

I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from the announcement to the implications. I'll end with the positive outcome, emphasizing justice and equality.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved using the specified words. Make sure it's clear and impactful, reflecting the significance of the decision.

SUMMARY:  
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits, such as health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued guidance ensuring legally married same-sex couples have equal access to benefits, including health, vision, and long-term care insurance. While the memo does not explicitly address couples living in states where same-sex marriage is not recognized, OPM emphasizes that benefits are available to all legally married couples, regardless of state laws. President Obama expressed his belief that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, while the administration works on the legalities. Attorney General Eric Holder praised the move, stating that same-sex couples are entitled to equal treatment and that these changes will make a meaningful, positive difference in their lives. The administration is committed to implementing the ruling swiftly, ensuring federal employees and their families receive the respect and protection they deserve. END OF SUMMARY.
