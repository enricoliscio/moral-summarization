Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the Obama administration extending federal benefits to same-sex spouses after the Supreme Court struck down part of DOMA. 

First, I'll identify the key points. The benefits include health insurance, retirement accounts, and vision care. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo clarifying that legally married same-sex couples have the same access as heterosexual couples. They didn't specify state laws, implying benefits are available regardless of where they live. President Obama supports this and mentions the legal aspects. The Department of Justice and Pentagon are involved in implementing these changes. The moral angle here is about equality and justice, so I should highlight that the administration is ensuring equal treatment under federal law.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main elements: who, what, when, where, why. Also, emphasize the moral stance on equality. I'll structure it by mentioning the benefits, the administration's action, the memo's details, state laws omission, Obama's support, and the positive impact on families. I'll keep the language clear and straightforward, focusing on the justice and equality aspects.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration has extended federal benefits, including health insurance, vision care, and retirement accounts, to same-sex spouses of federal employees, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo clarifying that legally married same-sex couples now have equal access to benefits previously reserved for heterosexual couples. While the memo does not explicitly address state laws, it suggests that benefits will be available to all legally married couples, regardless of their state of residence. President Obama expressed support for treating married couples equally under federal law, emphasizing the importance of equal protection and respect for all families. Attorney General Eric Holder and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also welcomed the changes, noting their positive impact on same-sex couples and their families. The administration is working to implement these benefits swiftly, reflecting a commitment to justice and equality under the law. END OF SUMMARY.
