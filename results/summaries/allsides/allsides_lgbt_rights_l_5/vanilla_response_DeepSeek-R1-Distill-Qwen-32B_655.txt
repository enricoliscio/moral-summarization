Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This decision came two days after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. 

The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing the benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. They mention that couples legally married in one state will have access regardless of where they live, though there's no specific detail on state laws. President Obama supports this move, calling it a step towards equality. Other officials like Chuck Hagel and Eric Holder also support the changes, emphasizing equal treatment under federal law.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the administration's decision, the benefits included, the Supreme Court's ruling, the memo's details, and the officials' support. I should ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). A memo from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) details that legally married same-sex couples will have equal access to benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. While the memo does not specify how benefits will apply to couples living in states where same-sex marriage is not recognized, OPM states that benefits will be available to all legally married couples. President Obama expressed support for treating married couples equally under federal law, and other officials, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Attorney General Eric Holder, welcomed the changes. The administration is working to implement the ruling swiftly, ensuring equal treatment for same-sex couples under federal law. END OF SUMMARY.
