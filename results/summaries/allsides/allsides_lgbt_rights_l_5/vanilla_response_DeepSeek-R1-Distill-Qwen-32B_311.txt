Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Obama administration making changes to federal benefits for same-sex spouses after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). 

First, the main points are that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits like health insurance, retirement accounts, vision, dental, etc. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo to agencies detailing these changes. It mentions that the memo doesn't specify state laws, implying benefits are available regardless of where the couple lives. 

President Obama supports treating same-sex couples as married in all states, though the administration is still figuring out the legal details. The Pentagon and Department of Justice are also involved in expanding these benefits. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all key points without getting too detailed.

I should structure it to first state the main change, then who is involved (OPM, President, Pentagon, DOJ), and the implications. Also, mention the administration's next steps in ensuring equality across states. I need to make sure it's clear and flows well, hitting all the essential information without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health insurance, retirement accounts, vision, dental, and long-term care insurance, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo detailing these changes, ensuring legally married same-sex couples have the same access to benefits as heterosexual couples. While the memo does not explicitly address state laws, it implies that benefits will be available regardless of the state in which couples reside. President Obama supports treating same-sex couples as married across all states, though the administration is still navigating legal details. The Pentagon and Department of Justice are also working to expand these benefits. Attorney General Eric Holder praised the move, stating that same-sex couples deserve equal treatment under the law. These changes aim to implement the Supreme Court's ruling, ensuring federal benefits are extended to all married couples equally. END OF SUMMARY.
