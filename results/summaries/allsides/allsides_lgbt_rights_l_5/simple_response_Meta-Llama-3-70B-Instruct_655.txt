SUMMARY:

In a landmark move, the Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, effective immediately. This decision comes two days after the Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The administration's guidance ensures that legally married same-sex spouses will have the same access to benefits as heterosexual married couples, regardless of the state they live in. President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working to make that a reality. The move is hailed as a critical first step towards implementing the Supreme Court's decision, ensuring that all married couples - gay and straight - are treated equally under federal law. This change will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, and is a significant step towards equal protection and equal treatment under the law.
