SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the Obama administration has taken a significant step towards equality for same-sex couples, extending federal benefits to the spouses of gay and lesbian government employees. This move comes just two days after the Supreme Court's repeal of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied these couples equal rights under the law. The Office of Personnel Management has directed that all legally married couples, regardless of sexual orientation, be given access to the same benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This is a powerful statement of equality and respect for all families, and a step towards ensuring that all citizens are treated with the dignity and fairness that they deserve. The President has affirmed that this is just the beginning of a process to ensure equal treatment for all married couples across the country, regardless of the state they live in. Attorney General Eric Holder has also welcomed this move, stating that it is a step towards fulfilling the promise of equal protection and equal treatment for all Americans. This decision is a victory for morality and justice, affirming that all citizens are worthy of equal respect and protection under the law.
END OF SUMMARY.
