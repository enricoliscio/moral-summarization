SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has taken a critical first step towards implementing the landmark Supreme Court decision, declaring that all married couples - gay and straight - should be treated equally under federal law. Same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, immediately. The Office of Personnel Management has offered guidance, detailing access to many benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, to which legally married same-sex spouses will now have the same access as heterosexual married couples. The administration is working on the legalities of making same-sex couples married in one state treated as married in all 50 states. The President has applauded the expansion of access to federal benefits, stating that thousands of gays and lesbians serve the country every day and deserve the same respect and protection as every other family. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, ensuring that Americans in same-sex marriages are entitled to equal protection and equal treatment under the law.

END OF SUMMARY.
