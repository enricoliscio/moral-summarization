SUMMARY: 
The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees will now have access to benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. This announcement ensures that legally married same-sex couples will have equal rights and access to benefits just as heterosexual married couples do. The Office of Personnel Management's guidance did not specify the benefits for couples who marry in one state and live in another where same-sex marriage is not recognized, but the administration is working on ensuring equality across all states. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder applauded this expansion of benefits as a step toward ensuring equality and justice for all, regardless of sexual orientation. They emphasized the importance of respecting and protecting all families, and the need to swiftly implement the Supreme Court's decision to ensure fairness for all Americans entitled to equal protection under the law. This change is a positive step toward fulfilling the promise of equal treatment for all married couples, and the administration is committed to ensuring its smooth and swift implementation, as directed by the President.
