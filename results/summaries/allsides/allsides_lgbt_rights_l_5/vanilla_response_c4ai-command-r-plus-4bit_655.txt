SUMMARY: The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees will now have access to various benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This decision follows the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing the benefits, which are now available to legally married same-sex couples, mirroring those offered to heterosexual married couples. President Obama supported the expansion of federal benefits, stating that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. Attorney General Eric Holder also welcomed the decision, emphasizing equal protection and treatment for Americans in same-sex marriages. The announcement was a critical step toward implementing the Supreme Court's decision, and it received praise for positively impacting the lives of many.
