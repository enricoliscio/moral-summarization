SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has taken a critical first step towards implementing the landmark Supreme Court decision, declaring that all married couples - gay and straight - should be treated equally under federal law. Same-sex spouses of federal employees can now begin applying for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, immediately. The Office of Personnel Management has offered guidance, detailing access to many benefits, repeating that benefits will be available to all legally married couples, regardless of the state in which they live. President Barack Obama believes couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working on the legalities of making that reality. The expansion of access to federal benefits is a positive step, ensuring that thousands of gays and lesbians serving in the federal government, and their spouses and children, deserve the same respect and protection as every other family. The Department of Justice will continue to coordinate with other federal agencies to implement this ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible.
