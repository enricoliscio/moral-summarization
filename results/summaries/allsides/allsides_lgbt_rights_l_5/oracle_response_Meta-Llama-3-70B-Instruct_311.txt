SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, immediately following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. This expansion of access to federal benefits is a critical step towards implementing the landmark Supreme Court decision, declaring that all married couples - gay and straight - should be treated equally under federal law. The administration is working to make this reality, with the Justice Department leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA. This change will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, as same-sex couples will now have the same access to benefits as heterosexual couples. The President believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and is directing the implementation of this ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible.
