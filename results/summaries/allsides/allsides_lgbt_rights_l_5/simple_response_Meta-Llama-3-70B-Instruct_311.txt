SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. This move marks a significant step towards implementing the court's ruling, which declared that all married couples, gay and straight, should be treated equally under federal law. The administration's decision is a critical step towards providing equal respect and protection to all families, regardless of sexual orientation. Thousands of gay and lesbian federal employees and their families will now have access to the same benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of DOMA, and other federal agencies are working to ensure a swift and smooth transition. This decision will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, and is a significant step towards realizing the promise of equal protection and equal treatment under the law.

END OF SUMMARY.
