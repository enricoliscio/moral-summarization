SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has taken a critical first step towards implementing the landmark Supreme Court decision that declared all married couples, gay and straight, should be treated equally under federal law. Same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, immediately. The Office of Personnel Management has offered guidance, detailing access to many benefits that were previously denied to same-sex couples. This expansion of access is a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, and the administration is working to make it a reality. President Barack Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA. The Justice Department is coordinating with other federal agencies to implement this ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible. This move is a critical step towards treating all married couples with the respect and protection they deserve.
