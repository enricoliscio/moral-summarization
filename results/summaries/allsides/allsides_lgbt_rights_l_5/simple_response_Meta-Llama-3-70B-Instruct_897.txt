SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move ensures that legally married same-sex couples have equal access to benefits as heterosexual couples. The administration's guidance does not address the benefits available to same-sex couples who marry in one state but live in another where their union is not recognized. However, President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working to make that a reality. The expansion of benefits is seen as a critical step towards implementing the Supreme Court's decision and ensuring equal treatment under federal law. The move is hailed as a positive step towards equality, respect, and protection for all families, regardless of sexual orientation.
