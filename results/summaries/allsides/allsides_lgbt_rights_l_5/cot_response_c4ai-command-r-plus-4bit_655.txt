SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has taken a critical step towards justice and equality for same-sex spouses of federal employees by granting them access to benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts. This move ensures that legally married same-sex couples will have the same rights as heterosexual married couples in terms of health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. The acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, Elaine Kaplan, sent a memo to executive departments and agencies detailing these changes, which are a response to the Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. Attorney General Eric Holder applauded the expansion of benefits, stating that same-sex spouses are entitled to equal protection and treatment under the law. He emphasized the positive impact these changes will have on the lives of many, ensuring that all families are respected and protected, and that the promise of equality is upheld. President Obama also welcomed the expansion of benefits, directing the Justice Department to coordinate with other agencies to swiftly implement these changes and ensure that all married couples, regardless of sexual orientation, are treated equally under federal law. This decision is a testament to the administration's commitment to fairness and respect for all, including those who serve our country and their families. END OF SUMMARY.
