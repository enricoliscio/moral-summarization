Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a summary of a news article, preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Obama administration expanding benefits to same-sex spouses after the DOMA ruling. 

First, I need to understand the main points. The key elements are the benefits now available, the administration's response, the legal implications, and the moral stance on equality.

I should start by identifying the main actions: the administration allowing same-sex spouses to access federal benefits like health insurance and retirement. They did this two days after the Supreme Court ruling. 

Next, the moral aspect is important. The president and other officials are emphasizing equality and respect for all families, which is a strong moral message. I need to make sure that's clear in the summary.

I also need to note that the memo doesn't specify state laws, implying benefits are available regardless of state, which is a significant point for equality.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details: who, what, when, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to highlight the administration's commitment to equal treatment under federal law.

I should structure it to first state the action, then the response, followed by the moral stance, and conclude with the broader impact. Keeping it clear and to the point while preserving the moral framing is crucial.
