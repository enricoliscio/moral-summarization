SUMMARY:

In a landmark move, the Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, effective immediately. This decision comes two days after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The administration's move ensures that legally married same-sex couples will have the same access to benefits as heterosexual married couples, regardless of the state they live in. President Obama has emphasized that all married couples, gay and straight, should be treated equally under federal law. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, and other federal agencies, including the Pentagon, are also working to expand benefits to same-sex couples. This decision is a critical step towards implementing the Supreme Court's ruling and ensuring equal protection and treatment under the law for all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation.
