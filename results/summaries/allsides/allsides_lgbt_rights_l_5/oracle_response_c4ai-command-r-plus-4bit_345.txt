SUMMARY: Same-sex spouses of federal employees in the US will now have access to the same benefits as their heterosexual counterparts, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This follows the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, with the Office of Personnel Management offering guidance to executive departments and agencies. The benefits will be available to all legally married couples, regardless of the state they live in, although the memo does not specify the benefits for couples who marry in states where same-sex marriage is legal but live in a state where it is not. President Obama has supported this expansion of benefits, stating that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. Attorney General Eric Holder welcomed the move, stating that Americans in same-sex marriages are entitled to equal protection and treatment under the law. The changes will ensure that same-sex couples and their families are treated with respect and protected under the law. This is a positive step forward in implementing the Supreme Court's ruling and ensuring equal treatment for all married couples.

END OF SUMMARY.
