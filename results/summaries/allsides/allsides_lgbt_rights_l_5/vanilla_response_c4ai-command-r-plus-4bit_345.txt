SUMMARY: The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, following the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. This decision grants legally married same-sex couples the same access to benefits as heterosexual married couples. The Office of Personnel Management informed executive departments and agencies of the change, while President Obama affirmed that couples married in one state should be recognized in all states. The expansion of benefits was applauded by President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, emphasizing equal treatment and respect for all families. The Department of Justice is leading the implementation process, working to ensure swift and smooth execution of the ruling. This change represents a significant step towards equality and will positively impact the lives of many Americans in same-sex marriages.
