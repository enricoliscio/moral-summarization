SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance detailing access to benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, which will be available to all legally married same-sex spouses. The administration is working on implementing the Supreme Court's decision, with President Obama stating that he believes couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states. The Justice Department is leading the implementation, and Attorney General Eric Holder has welcomed the announcement, saying it will make a meaningful difference in the lives of many.
