SUMMARY: Same-sex spouses of federal employees in the US will now have access to benefits including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturn of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has stated that legally married same-sex spouses will be treated equally to heterosexual married couples in terms of health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. The Obama administration has applauded this expansion of benefits as a critical step toward ensuring equal treatment under federal law for all married couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Attorney General Eric Holder has emphasized that Americans in same-sex marriages are entitled to equal protection and respect, and that the changes will have a positive impact on the lives of many. President Obama has directed the Justice Department to lead the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, ensuring that gays and lesbians serving the federal government receive the same respect and protection as their heterosexual counterparts. This move by the federal government represents a significant step forward in recognizing the rights and dignity of same-sex spouses.
END OF SUMMARY.
