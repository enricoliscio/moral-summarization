Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration expanding benefits to same-sex spouses. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the federal government making health insurance, retirement accounts, and other benefits available to same-sex spouses after the Supreme Court overturned a part of DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing these benefits, and the president and other officials are supporting this move, emphasizing equality and fairness.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Words like "available," "open," "overturned," "access," "married," "treated," "working," "reality," "expansion," "step," "declaring," "equally," "serve," "deserve," "respect," "protection," "direction," "leading," "implementation," "repeal," "ruling," "expand," "entitled," "treatment," "extending," "promise," "changes," "meaningful," "positive," "directed," "implement."

I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the key moral points: equality, access, justice, and the administration's proactive stance.

I'll start by mentioning the availability of benefits to same-sex spouses, referencing the Supreme Court's overturning of DOMA. Then, I'll note the expansion of access and the administration's efforts to ensure equal treatment. Including the president's support and the departments' actions to implement the changes would highlight the moral commitment.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the announcement, then the Supreme Court decision, followed by the administration's response, and concluding with the positive impact on families. Using the morally framed words will emphasize the ethical and just nature of the changes.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring the summary is within the word limit and includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check each sentence to see if it incorporates the moral framing effectively and conveys the administration's commitment to equality and justice.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration has expanded federal benefits to same-sex spouses, making health insurance, vision benefits, and retirement accounts available immediately. This move follows the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued guidance ensuring legally married same-sex couples have access to the same benefits as heterosexual couples, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. The administration is working to implement the ruling, with President Obama emphasizing that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. Attorney General Eric Holder praised the expansion, stating that same-sex couples are entitled to equal protection and treatment. The changes reflect a meaningful step toward equality, ensuring federal employees and their families receive the respect and protection they deserve. The administration is committed to leading the implementation of DOMA's repeal, with the Department of Justice coordinating efforts to extend benefits and fulfill the promise of equal treatment under the law. END OF SUMMARY.
