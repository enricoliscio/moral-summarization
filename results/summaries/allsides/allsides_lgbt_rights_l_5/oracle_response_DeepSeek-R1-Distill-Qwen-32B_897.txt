Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced. Words like "available," "access," "married," "equally," "deserve," "respect," and "implementation" come to mind.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the overturning of DOMA, the benefits now available, the administration's guidance, and the president's support. I should mention the Office of Personnel Management's memo, the benefits listed, and the administration's commitment to equal treatment regardless of state laws.

I also need to highlight the positive impact, using words like "meaningful," "positive," and "promise." Including the president's and attorney general's statements will add the moral weight, emphasizing equality and respect.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: start with the Supreme Court decision, then the administration's actions, followed by the benefits available, and conclude with the positive outcome. I'll make sure each sentence uses the moral terms appropriately without overcomplicating the summary.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered succinctly. Making sure the summary reflects the moral framing while being clear and concise is the goal here.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued guidance, emphasizing that benefits are open to all legally married couples, regardless of state laws.
