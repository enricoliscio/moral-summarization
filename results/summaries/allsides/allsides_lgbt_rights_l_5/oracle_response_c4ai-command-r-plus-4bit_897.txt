SUMMARY: Following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, the Obama administration has opened access to benefits for same-sex spouses of federal employees. The Office of Personnel Management has detailed the expansion of benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, to ensure that legally married same-sex spouses are treated equally to heterosexual married couples. The memo, signed by acting director Elaine Kaplan, emphasizes that all legally married couples, regardless of the state they live in, will have access to these benefits. President Obama has affirmed that same-sex couples should be treated equally under federal law and has directed the Justice Department to lead the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA. This step forward has been applauded by Attorney General Eric Holder, who welcomed the extension of benefits as a meaningful and positive change that ensures equal treatment and respect for all federal employees and their families.
