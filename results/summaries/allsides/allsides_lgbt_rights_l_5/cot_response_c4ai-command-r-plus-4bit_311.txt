SUMMARY:
The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees will now have access to benefits such as health insurance, retirement accounts, and other protections previously only available to heterosexual married couples. This guidance comes two days after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management is leading the implementation of this change, ensuring that all legally married couples are treated equally under federal law. Attorney General Eric Holder welcomed this expansion of benefits as a critical step toward ensuring equal protection and treatment for Americans in same-sex marriages. President Obama applauded the move, stating that it is a critical first step toward fulfilling the promise of the Supreme Court's decision. The administration is working to ensure that same-sex couples are treated equally across all 50 states, regardless of the state in which they live or were married. The Department of Justice and other agencies are coordinating to swiftly and smoothly implement these changes, which are expected to have a positive impact on the lives of many.
