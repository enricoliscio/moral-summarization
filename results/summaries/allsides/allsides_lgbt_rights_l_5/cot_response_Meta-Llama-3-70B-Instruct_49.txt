SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturn of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move marks a "critical first step" towards implementing the landmark decision, which declares that all married couples - gay and straight - should be treated equally under federal law. President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working on the legalities of making that reality. The expansion of access to federal benefits is a "promise" of equal protection and equal treatment under the law, and will make a "meaningful, positive difference" in the lives of many. The Justice Department will continue to coordinate with other federal agencies to implement this ruling as "swiftly and smoothly" as possible. END OF SUMMARY.
