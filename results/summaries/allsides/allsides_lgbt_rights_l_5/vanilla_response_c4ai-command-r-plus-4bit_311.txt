SUMMARY: The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees will now have access to various benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This decision follows the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo to executive departments detailing the benefits, which are now available to legally married same-sex spouses, mirroring those offered to heterosexual married couples. The memo did not specify the benefits for couples who marry in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage but reside in a state that does not. President Obama expressed his support for equal treatment of married couples across all states and directed the Justice Department to lead the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Attorney General Eric Holder also welcomed the decision, emphasizing the importance of equal protection and treatment for all Americans.

END OF SUMMARY.
