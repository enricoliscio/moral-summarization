Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they're a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they probably want a concise summary that highlights the ethical or moral aspects of the story.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This change came after the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo detailing the benefits, including vision and long-term care insurance. The memo doesn't specify state laws, implying that benefits are available regardless of where the couple lives. President Obama and other officials, like Eric Holder, praised this move, emphasizing equality and the importance of respecting all families.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. The key moral points are equality, respect, and the administration's commitment to treating same-sex couples equally under federal law. I should highlight the administration's actions as a step towards equality and the positive impact on families.

I should structure the summary to include the main events: the administration's decision, the benefits available, the legal context (DOMA ruling), and the officials' statements supporting equality. I'll keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by stating the administration's action, mention the benefits, reference the DOMA ruling, and then include the officials' comments on equality and respect. I should avoid getting bogged down in details like the memo's specifics unless they're crucial to the moral aspect, which they are because they show the administration's stance on state laws.

I also need to ensure the summary flows well and each sentence adds value without redundancy. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. 

Wait, I should also mention that the memo doesn't specify state laws, which is important because it shows the administration's broad approach to granting benefits regardless of state laws, reinforcing the moral stance of equality across the nation.

Including President Obama's and Eric Holder's statements will emphasize the moral commitment. I should make sure their quotes are paraphrased to fit the summary without losing the essence of their support for equality.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure each sentence transitions smoothly and covers the key points without unnecessary details. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, focusing on the ethical implications of the decision.

President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder praised the move, emphasizing equality and respect for all families. The administration is working to implement the ruling swiftly, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also committing to expanding benefits for same-sex couples in the military. The changes mark a significant step toward equal treatment under federal law for same-sex couples and their families. END OF SUMMARY.
