SUMMARY: Following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, the Obama administration has acted to expand access to benefits for same-sex spouses of federal employees. The Office of Personnel Management has announced that legally married same-sex spouses will now have access to health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, as well as retirement accounts, on par with heterosexual married couples. This move treats all legally married couples equally under federal law and acknowledges the service and dedication of federal employees, regardless of their sexual orientation. President Obama has affirmed that same-sex spouses deserve equal respect, protection, and benefits, directing the Justice Department to lead the implementation of this ruling swiftly. Attorney General Eric Holder has welcomed the changes, stating that they will have a positive impact on the lives of many and are a critical step toward fulfilling the promise of equal treatment under the law for all Americans.
