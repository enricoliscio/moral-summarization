Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access certain benefits. They mentioned health insurance, retirement accounts, and others like vision and dental. This change came after the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act. 

I should note that the Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing these benefits, and it applies to legally married same-sex couples regardless of where they live, even if their state doesn't recognize same-sex marriage. President Obama supports this and believes couples should be treated as married everywhere, but the administration is still working on the legal details.

Also, the President and Attorney General Holder are applauding this move, saying it's a step towards equality. The Department of Defense is also moving to expand benefits. The summary should capture all these points concisely, making sure to mention the key benefits, the Supreme Court decision, the administration's response, and the support from Obama and Holder. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.
