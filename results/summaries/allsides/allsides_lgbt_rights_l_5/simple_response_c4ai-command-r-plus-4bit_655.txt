SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, ruling that same-sex spouses should be treated equally under federal law. The Obama administration swiftly acted on this ruling, ensuring that federal employees' same-sex spouses can now access the same benefits as heterosexual married couples, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. This move is a significant step forward in recognizing the equal rights and dignity of all couples, regardless of sexual orientation, and sends a powerful message of equality and respect. While questions remain about the legal status of couples who marry in one state and live in another with different laws, the administration is committed to working through these complexities to ensure fairness for all. The expansion of benefits has been applauded by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, emphasizing the importance of treating all Americans with equality and respect, and ensuring that the promise of equal protection under the law is realized for the LGBT community. This decision is a moral victory, affirming the fundamental principle that love and commitment between two consenting adults deserve recognition and celebration, regardless of gender. 

END OF SUMMARY.
