SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. This move marks a significant step towards implementing the court's landmark decision, which declared that all married couples, gay and straight, should be treated equally under federal law. The administration's guidance ensures that legally married same-sex spouses will have the same access to benefits as heterosexual married couples, regardless of the state in which they live. President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have all welcomed the expansion of benefits, emphasizing that same-sex couples and their families deserve equal respect and protection under the law. This decision will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, and the administration will continue to work towards a swift and smooth implementation of the ruling.
