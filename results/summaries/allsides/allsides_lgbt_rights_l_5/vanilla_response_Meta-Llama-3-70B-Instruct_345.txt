SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, effective immediately. This move comes two days after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance detailing access to benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, for legally married same-sex spouses. The administration appears to be taking the stance that these benefits will be available to couples regardless of the state in which they live. President Obama has applauded the expansion of access to federal benefits, stating that it is a critical first step towards implementing the Supreme Court's decision. The Justice Department is leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, and other federal agencies, including the Pentagon, are also moving to expand benefits to same-sex couples.
