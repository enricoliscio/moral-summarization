SUMMARY: The Obama administration announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits such as health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, following the Supreme Court's ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing the benefits that legally married same-sex spouses will have access to, which are the same as those available to heterosexual married couples. The memo did not specify the benefits for couples who marry in a state where same-sex marriage is legal but live in a state where it is not, but implied that they would have access to the listed benefits regardless of their state of residence. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder both applauded the expansion of federal benefits as a step towards equal treatment and protection for all married couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also stated that the Pentagon will work to expand benefits for same-sex couples. This announcement marks a significant step forward in ensuring equal rights and benefits for same-sex spouses of federal employees. END OF SUMMARY.
