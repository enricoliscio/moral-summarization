SUMMARY:
The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. This "critical first step" towards implementing the landmark decision ensures that all married couples, gay and straight, are treated equally under federal law. President Barack Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working on the legalities of making that reality. The expansion of access to federal benefits is a "meaningful, positive difference" in the lives of many, and the Department of Justice will continue to coordinate with other federal agencies to implement the ruling as swiftly and smoothly as possible. This move is a step towards fulfilling the "promise" of equal protection and equal treatment under the law for all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation. END OF SUMMARY.
