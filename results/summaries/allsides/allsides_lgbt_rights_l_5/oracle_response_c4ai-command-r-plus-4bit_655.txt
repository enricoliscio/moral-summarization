SUMMARY: Same-sex spouses of federal employees in the US will now have access to a range of benefits previously only available to heterosexual married couples, following the Supreme Court's overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Office of Personnel Management has outlined the benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, which will now be open to all legally married couples, regardless of their sexual orientation. The move has been applauded by President Obama, who has stated that all married couples should be treated equally under federal law and that those in same-sex marriages are entitled to equal protection and respect. The expansion of these benefits is a critical step in ensuring equality for all married couples and recognizing the service and dedication of federal employees, regardless of their sexual orientation. Attorney General Eric Holder has also welcomed the changes, stating that they will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of those affected. The Department of Justice is working to implement these changes swiftly and smoothly, ensuring that all legally married couples are treated equally and with respect, as they deserve. END OF SUMMARY.
