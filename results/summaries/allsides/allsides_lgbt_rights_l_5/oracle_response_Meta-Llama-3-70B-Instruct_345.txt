SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits, including health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. This expansion of access to federal benefits is a critical step towards implementing the landmark ruling, which declares that all married couples, gay and straight, should be treated equally under federal law. The administration is working to make this reality, with the Justice Department leading the implementation of the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA. This change will make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, as same-sex spouses will now have the same access to benefits as heterosexual married couples. President Obama believes that couples married in one state should be treated as married in all 50 states, and his administration is working on the legalities of making this a reality. This expansion of benefits is a significant step towards providing equal respect and protection to all families, regardless of sexual orientation.
