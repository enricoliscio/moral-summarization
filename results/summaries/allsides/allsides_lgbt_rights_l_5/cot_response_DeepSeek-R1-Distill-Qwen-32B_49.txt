Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article talks about the Obama administration allowing same-sex spouses of federal employees to access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This comes after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. The Office of Personnel Management sent a memo detailing these benefits, including vision and long-term care insurance. They mention that couples married in one state can access these benefits regardless of where they live, even if their state doesn't recognize same-sex marriage. President Obama supports this, saying all married couples should be treated equally under federal law. He mentions that thousands of gays and lesbians work in the federal government and deserve the same respect as others. The Justice Department is leading the implementation, and other agencies like the Pentagon and the Attorney General are on board, emphasizing equal protection and treatment under the law. They expect these changes to positively impact many lives.

Now, for the summary, I need to include the key points and the moral framing. The morally framed words I identified include benefits, equality, justice, equal protection, equal treatment, respect, and promise. I should make sure these words are included to preserve the author's moral perspective.

I'll start by stating that the Obama administration is allowing same-sex spouses to access benefits, following the DOMA ruling. Then mention the types of benefits, the memo from OPM, and the state situation. Include Obama's support for equality, the agencies involved, and the positive impact expected. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure all the key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

The Obama administration has announced that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). This move reflects a commitment to equality and justice, ensuring that legally married same-sex couples receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clarified that these benefits are available regardless of the state in which couples reside, emphasizing equal protection and treatment under federal law. President Obama expressed his support, stating that all married couples should be treated equally nationwide. The Justice Department is leading the implementation, with other agencies like the Pentagon and the Attorney General also backing the decision, highlighting the importance of respect and equal treatment. These changes are expected to make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of many, fulfilling the promise of equality and justice.
