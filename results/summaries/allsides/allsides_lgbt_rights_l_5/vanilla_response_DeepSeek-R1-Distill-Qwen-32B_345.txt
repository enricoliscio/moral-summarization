Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about same-sex spouses getting federal benefits. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by saying that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now apply for benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. This change comes after the Supreme Court overturned part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sent a memo to all executive departments, outlining the benefits available, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance. They mention that these benefits are now available to legally married same-sex couples, just like heterosexual couples.

But there's a caveat: the memo doesn't specify what happens if a couple is legally married in one state but lives in another where same-sex marriage isn't recognized. OPM says benefits are available to all legally married couples, regardless of where they live. President Obama supports this, saying he believes couples should be treated as married everywhere, though the administration is still working on the legal details.

Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder praised the changes, calling it a step toward equality. The Department of Justice is leading the implementation, and the Pentagon is also moving to expand benefits. The article ends by noting that these changes will positively impact many lives.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the key points: the benefits now available, the Supreme Court ruling, OPM's memo, the state law omission, Obama's stance, and the positive reception from the administration.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main action (benefits available now), then the reason (Supreme Court ruling), followed by details of the memo, the state issue, Obama's comments, and the administration's support. Keep it concise, making sure not to exceed the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without unnecessary details. Avoid jargon, keep it straightforward.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: Same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key DOMA provision. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo extending benefits, including health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance, to legally married same-sex couples, aligning them with heterosexual couples. While the memo doesn't address couples living in states where same-sex marriage isn't recognized, OPM stated benefits are available to all legally married couples, regardless of residence. President Obama supports treating married couples equally nationwide, though legal details are still being worked out. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice praised the changes, calling them a step toward equality and a positive impact on many lives. END OF SUMMARY.
