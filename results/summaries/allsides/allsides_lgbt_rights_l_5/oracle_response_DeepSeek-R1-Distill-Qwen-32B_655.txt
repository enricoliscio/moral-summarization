Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Obama administration extending federal benefits to same-sex spouses after the Supreme Court overturned part of DOMA. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The main idea is that same-sex spouses of federal employees can now access benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts. The Office of Personnel Management issued a memo about this, and there's mention of state laws and the administration's stance on equal treatment. The president and other officials are supporting this move, emphasizing equality and respect for same-sex couples.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words the author used. They include words like "available," "open," "overturned," "access," "married," "treated," "equally," "deserve," "respect," "protection," "equality," "implementation," "repeal," "changes," "meaningful," "positive," etc. My summary needs to include as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. So, I'll start by outlining the main actions: the administration making benefits available, the overturning of DOMA, the memo from OPM, the president's support, and the positive impact on same-sex couples.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the announcement, then the background (Supreme Court decision), followed by the details of the benefits, and concluding with the administration's commitment to equality. I'll make sure to use the moral words to highlight the just and fair nature of the actions taken.

I need to ensure that the summary is concise but comprehensive, capturing all essential points while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, reflecting the positive and progressive changes brought about by the decision.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and effectively preserves the moral framing as per the user's request. I'll make sure all key points are covered and that the tone aligns with the author's original message of equality and justice.

SUMMARY:  
The Obama administration has made vision benefits and other federal employee benefits available to same-sex spouses, following the Supreme Court's overturning of a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). A memo from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) directs federal agencies to grant legally married same-sex couples access to benefits like health, dental, and vision insurance, treating them equally under federal law. While the memo does not explicitly address state laws, it emphasizes that benefits will be available to all legally married couples, regardless of their state of residence. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder praised the expansion of access, calling it a critical step toward equality and a meaningful, positive change for same-sex couples and their families. The administration is working to implement the repeal of DOMA's Section 3, ensuring that same-sex couples are entitled to equal protection and respect under the law. The changes reflect a commitment to fairness and justice, as federal employees and their families deserve the same benefits and treatment as heterosexual couples. END OF SUMMARY.
