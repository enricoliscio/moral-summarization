SUMMARY: 
The Obama administration has taken a stand for fairness and equal protection under the law by announcing that same-sex spouses of federal employees will now have access to benefits such as health insurance and retirement accounts, following the Supreme Court's repeal of DOMA's Section 3. This landmark decision ensures that all legally married couples, regardless of sexual orientation, will be treated with the respect and protection they deserve. Attorney General Eric Holder welcomed the expansion of benefits, stating that Americans in same-sex marriages are entitled to fairness and equal treatment. The changes will have a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of many, and the Justice Department, under the president's direction, is working swiftly to implement this ruling across all federal agencies. This is a significant step forward in ensuring equal respect, protection, and access to benefits for all married couples in the United States, regardless of their sexual orientation.
