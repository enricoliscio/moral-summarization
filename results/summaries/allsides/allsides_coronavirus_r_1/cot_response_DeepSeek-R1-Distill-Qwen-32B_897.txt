Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about New York's Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people who refused to talk with contact tracers. The task is to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a judgment or imply a moral stance, like "ignorance," "obstinance," "cooperate," "refuse," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that has a moral connotation.

Next, I have to write a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the moral issues involved, such as refusal to cooperate, the spread of the virus, and the measures taken by the officials.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing without adding any personal opinions. It's important to stick to the facts while emphasizing the moral aspects as presented in the original text.

I'll start by identifying the key points: issuance of subpoenas, refusal to speak with contact tracers, the impact on public health, the fines involved, and the officials' frustration. Then, I'll incorporate the morally framed words into the summary to reflect the author's perspective.

I need to be careful not to include any words that aren't morally framed, as per the user's instructions. Also, the summary should be clear and concise, making sure it's under 200 words.

Finally, I'll review both the identified words and the summary to ensure they meet the user's requirements and accurately reflect the moral framing in the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day emphasized that the health of the community should not be "compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert stated that failure to comply could result in a $2,000 daily fine. The individuals are suspected of attending a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the virus likely spread. Rupert expressed frustration that many infected individuals are refusing to answer calls, denying their attendance, or providing false information. Contact tracing is essential to stem the virus's spread, as it helps identify those who may have been exposed and requires them to quarantine. The county is struggling to contain a coronavirus cluster linked to the party, and officials stress the importance of cooperation to protect public health. END OF SUMMARY.
