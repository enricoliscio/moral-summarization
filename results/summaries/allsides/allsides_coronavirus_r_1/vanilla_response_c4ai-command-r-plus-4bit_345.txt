SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to provide information about their contacts is hindering efforts to contain a COVID-19 outbreak in the county. The subpoenas carry a fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation, stating that many people were not answering their phones or providing false information. County Executive Ed Day emphasized that the goal is not to get anyone in trouble but to protect the health of the community by identifying and quarantining potential exposures. The subpoenas are a last resort to gain the information needed to stop the spread of the virus.
END OF SUMMARY.
