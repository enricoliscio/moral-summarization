SUMMARY:
Health officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight people infected with COVID-19 who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The subpoenas come with a hefty fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized the importance of contact tracing to stem the spread of the deadly virus and appealed to the public's sense of moral obligation to "do the right thing for their neighbors." The infected individuals attended a party in Clarkstown on June 17, and their refusal to provide information about their contacts is compromising the health and safety of the community. Rupert expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation, with people hanging up on tracers, denying attendance at the party, and providing false information. She also criticized the host of the party for holding the event despite exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. The county is now struggling to contain the infection cluster that originated from this party. The subpoenas are a last resort to compel these individuals to do their moral duty and take responsibility for their actions to prevent further spread of the disease.
