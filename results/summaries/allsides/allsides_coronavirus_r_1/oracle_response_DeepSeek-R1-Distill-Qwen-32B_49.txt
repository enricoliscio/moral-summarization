Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided the article and the specific morally framed words they want included. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rockland County officials issuing subpoenas to eight people who refused to speak with contact tracers. They had attended a party where the host had COVID symptoms but still held the event. The officials are frustrated because these individuals are not cooperating, which is hindering contact tracing efforts. The morally charged words include things like "ignorance," "stupidity," "obstinance," and "refusal."

I need to make sure my summary includes these words and reflects the moral judgment the author has. I'll start by identifying the key events: issuing subpoenas, refusal to speak, the party details, the consequences of non-cooperation, and the importance of contact tracing.

I should structure the summary to first mention the subpoenas, then the reasons (ignorance, stupidity, obstinance), the refusal to answer, the party details, and the officials' frustration. I'll also highlight the goal of contact tracing to prevent spread, which ties into the moral framing.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the required moral terms without making it too lengthy. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials issued subpoenas to eight individuals allegedly infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day criticized their "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance," emphasizing the importance of preventing the virus's spread. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert stated that the refusal to answer calls or provide information has forced the county to take legal action. The individuals attended a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the host had symptoms but still held the event. Rupert expressed frustration, noting that some partygoers hung up, denied attendance, or provided false information. Contact tracing is essential to stem the spread, as it helps identify those exposed and requires them to quarantine. The county aims to "do the right thing for their neighbors" by encouraging voluntary cooperation, but the refusal to answer has left officials no choice but to issue subpoenas. END OF SUMMARY.
