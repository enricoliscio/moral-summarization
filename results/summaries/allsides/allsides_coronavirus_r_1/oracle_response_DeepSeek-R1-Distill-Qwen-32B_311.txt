Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Rockland County officials issuing subpoenas to eight people who refused to speak with contact tracers. The officials are frustrated because these individuals are not cooperating, which is hindering efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. They mention terms like "ignorance," "stupidity," "obstinancy," and "refusal," which are key to the moral framing.

I should start by identifying the main points: the issuance of subpoenas, the reasons behind it (failure to cooperate), the consequences (potential fines), the context of the June 17 party, and the officials' emphasis on community responsibility.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words. Let me structure it step by step.

First, mention the issuance of subpoenas and the officials' frustration. Then, explain the refusal to answer contact tracers and the impact on preventing spread. Highlight the consequences and the officials' desire for voluntary cooperation. Finally, note the party details and the broader implications.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts while keeping the moral tone intact. Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows naturally and includes all necessary elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals allegedly infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day criticized their behavior, calling it a result of "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance," and warned of a $2,000 daily fine for noncompliance. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert explained that these individuals declined to answer calls or speak with tracers, making it impossible to prevent further spread of the virus. The refusal stems from a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the host reportedly had symptoms but still gathered others. Rupert emphasized the importance of contact tracing to "stem" the spread and expressed frustration over individuals denying their attendance or failing to answer calls. Day stressed that the goal is to protect the community, not punish individuals, but cooperation is essential to "keep" the virus from spreading. The officialsâ€™ actions highlight the challenges of enforcing public health measures when some refuse to answer calls or provide necessary information. END OF SUMMARY.
