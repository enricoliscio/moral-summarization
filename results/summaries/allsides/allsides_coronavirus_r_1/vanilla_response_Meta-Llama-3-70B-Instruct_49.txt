SUMMARY:

Officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17. The individuals refused to cooperate with contact tracers, prompting the county to take legal action. According to County Executive Ed Day, "the health of our county will not be compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." Failure to comply with the subpoenas will result in a daily fine of $2,000. The county's health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, stated that the individuals are not answering their phones or refusing to talk to contact tracers, hindering efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Contact tracing is crucial in stemming the spread of COVID-19, and the goal is to notify those who have been in contact with infected individuals and require them to quarantine for 14 days. The county is struggling to contain a coronavirus infection cluster that began at the June 17 party.
