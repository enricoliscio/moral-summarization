SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, north of New York City, where they contracted the virus. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized the importance of contact tracing in preventing the spread of the disease. They aim to identify and notify other potential infections to quarantine. The subpoenas carry a penalty of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. Rupert expressed frustration with the lack of cooperation from the infected individuals and their contacts, citing instances of phone calls being ignored or refused and misinformation provided by parents of adult children. Local health officials are working to contain an infection cluster stemming from the party. The county's efforts highlight the challenges faced by health authorities across the country in their attempts to control the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing.
