SUMMARY:

Officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17. The individuals refused to cooperate with contact tracers, ignoring requests to discuss their contacts and potential spread of the virus. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert warned that failure to comply would result in a $2,000 daily fine. The officials stressed that they want to identify and notify those who may have been exposed to the virus, but the infected individuals are not answering their phones or refusing to talk. The party's host had coronavirus symptoms but still held the event. Contact tracing is crucial to containing the spread of COVID-19, and local officials are struggling to contain a cluster of infections that originated from the party.

END OF SUMMARY.
