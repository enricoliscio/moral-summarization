Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Rockland County officials issuing subpoenas to eight people infected with COVID-19 who refused to speak with contact tracers. The officials are frustrated because these individuals aren't cooperating, which is hindering efforts to control the spread of the virus.

I notice that the article mentions the moral aspect, where the officials emphasize the importance of cooperation for the community's health. They stress that people should do the right thing for their neighbors. This moral framing is crucial, so I need to include that in the summary.

Next, I should identify the key points: the issuance of subpoenas, the reason for non-cooperation, the impact on contact tracing, and the officials' frustration. I also need to mention the consequences of not complying, like the daily fine, and the context of a cluster from a party.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements while highlighting the moral responsibility aspect. I'll structure it by first stating the action taken, then the reason, followed by the officials' statements about cooperation and the necessity of stopping the spread.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the main action, explaining the reasons, and ending with the officials' stance on community responsibility. This way, the moral framing is preserved as the user requested.
