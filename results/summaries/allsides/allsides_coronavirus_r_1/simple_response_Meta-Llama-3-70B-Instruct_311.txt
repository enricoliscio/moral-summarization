SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17. The individuals have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, ignoring interview requests and refusing to provide information about their contacts. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized that the health of the community is at risk due to the individuals' "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." Failure to comply with the subpoenas will result in a daily fine of $2,000. Officials stressed that their goal is not to punish, but to protect the community by identifying and notifying those who may have been exposed to the virus. The refusal to cooperate is not only irresponsible but also hinders efforts to stem the spread of the disease. As Day said, "We want people to do the right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily cooperate with health officials.
