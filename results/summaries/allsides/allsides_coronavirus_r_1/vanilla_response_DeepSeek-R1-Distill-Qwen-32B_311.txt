Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rockland County, New York, issuing subpoenas to eight people infected with COVID-19. They refused to speak with contact tracers. The county officials are frustrated because these individuals aren't cooperating, which hinders contact tracing efforts. The subpoenas are a way to compel them to talk, with a $2,000 daily fine for non-compliance. The issue started at a June 17 party where some attendees had symptoms but still went. The host had symptoms but held the event. The health department is struggling to get cooperation, with people refusing calls, denying attendance, or lying about their whereabouts. Contact tracing is crucial to stop the spread, but without cooperation, it's challenging.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the subpoenas, the reason (refusing contact tracing), the fines, the party incident, the refusal to cooperate, and the importance of contact tracing. I'll make sure to include key details like the number of people, the fines, the party date, and the officials' statements about cooperation.

Let me structure it: introduce the subpoenas, explain why, mention the fines, talk about the party and host's actions, describe the cooperation issues, and conclude with the importance of contact tracing and the county's struggle.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence is concise. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically from the subpoenas to the reasons, the party, cooperation issues, and the impact on contact tracing. I'll make sure to highlight the officials' frustration and the potential consequences of non-compliance.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County, New York, has issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County officials aim to compel them to speak with health investigators to identify others potentially exposed during a June 17 party in Clarkstown. Patricia Rupert, the county’s health commissioner, stated that the individuals have declined to provide information, hindering efforts to curb the virus’s spread. Ed Day, the county executive, emphasized the importance of cooperation to protect public health, warning of a $2,000 daily fine for non-compliance. Rupert noted that some individuals hang up, deny attendance, or provide false information, despite evidence of their involvement. Contact tracing is critical to identifying and isolating infected individuals, but the lack of cooperation has complicated efforts to contain a local outbreak linked to the party.  

END OF SUMMARY.
