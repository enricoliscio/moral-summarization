SUMMARY:
In a display of ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance, eight people in Rockland County, New York, have refused to cooperate with contact tracers after being infected with coronavirus at a party in June. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, have issued subpoenas to these individuals, threatening a $2,000 daily fine for non-compliance. The goal is to prevent these individuals from further spreading the virus by identifying their close contacts and requiring them to quarantine. Unfortunately, the infected partygoers are not answering calls or are refusing to provide information when they do answer. Rupert expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation, stating that some are even denying attendance at the party despite evidence to the contrary. Parents are also promising that their adult children have been home consistently when they have not. Day emphasized that officials do not want to get anyone in trouble but that their refusal to cooperate is forcing the county to take these measures. This situation highlights the importance of contact tracing in stemming the spread of COVID-19 and the moral imperative to do the right thing for the health of the community.
