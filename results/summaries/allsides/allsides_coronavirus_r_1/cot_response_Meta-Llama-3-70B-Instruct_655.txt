SUMMARY:
In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised" due to their actions. The individuals, who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a June 17 party, have refused to speak with contact tracers, forcing the county to take drastic measures. Day argued that they only want people to "do the right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily speak to health officials. However, their "refusal" to cooperate has led to the issuance of subpoenas, which will result in a "costly" $2,000 per day fine if they fail to comply. The county's health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, expressed frustration at the lack of "cooperation" and "necessary" information, emphasizing that contact tracing is essential to stemming the COVID-19 spread.
