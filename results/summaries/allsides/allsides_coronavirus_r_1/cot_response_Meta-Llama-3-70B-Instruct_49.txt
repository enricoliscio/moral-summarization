SUMMARY:
In Rockland County, New York, officials have taken drastic measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. After eight individuals, allegedly infected with the coronavirus, refused to cooperate with contact tracers, the county executive and health commissioner were forced to issue subpoenas. The officials emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." The individuals' refusal to speak with contact tracers has led to a "failure to comply" that will be "costly: $2,000 per day." The officials stressed that they want people to do the "right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily speak to health officials. However, the individuals' lack of "cooperation" and "denial" of their involvement in the party has forced the county to take action. The goal is to stem the spread of the disease through contact tracing, but the officials are struggling to contain the infection cluster due to the individuals' "refusal" to comply. END OF SUMMARY.
