SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The individuals attended a party in Clarkstown on June 17, which has been identified as the source of a COVID-19 outbreak in the county. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized the importance of contact tracing in preventing the spread of the virus and expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation from the infected individuals. Rupert stated that the party host exhibited coronavirus symptoms but held the event anyway, and many attendees were not forthcoming about their attendance or providing information about their contacts. To compel the infected individuals to cooperate, the county is imposing a $2,000 per day fine for non-compliance. The officials stressed that their primary goal is to protect the health of the community and appealed to residents to do the right thing by voluntarily speaking to health officials.
