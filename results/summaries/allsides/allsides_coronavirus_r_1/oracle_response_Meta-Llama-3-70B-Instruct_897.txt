SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason for their non-compliance. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised" due to such behavior. The individuals, who attended a party on June 17, have declined interview requests, refusing to answer questions about who they were in contact with, thereby hindering efforts to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. Despite warnings of a $2,000 per day fine, the individuals have continued to refuse to answer their phones or speak with health officials. The county's health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation, stating that "this must stop" and that the goal is to "stem" the spread of the disease. By issuing subpoenas, the county aims to compel the individuals to cooperate and "keep" the virus from spreading further.
