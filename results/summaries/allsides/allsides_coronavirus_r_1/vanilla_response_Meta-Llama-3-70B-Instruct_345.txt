SUMMARY:

Officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17. The individuals have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, ignoring requests for interviews to determine who else they may have come into contact with. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert warned that failure to comply with the subpoenas will result in a daily fine of $2,000. The officials stressed that their goal is not to penalize, but to prevent further spread of the virus by identifying and quarantining those who may have been exposed. Rupert expressed frustration that some individuals are not answering their phones or are denying attendance at the party, despite evidence to the contrary. Contact tracing is crucial in stemming the spread of COVID-19, and the county is taking a tough stance to ensure public health.
