SUMMARY: In a frustrating turn of events, officials in Rockland County, New York, were forced to issue subpoenas to eight people allegedly infected with coronavirus due to their refusal to cooperate with contact tracers. Ed Day, the county executive, and Patricia Rupert, the health commissioner, emphasized the importance of compliance in "stemming" the spread of COVID-19 and preventing further harm to "the health of our county." The subpoenas were a last resort after the infected individuals demonstrated ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance by not answering calls or interviews. The county is struggling to contain a coronavirus outbreak stemming from a party on June 17, as the host of the party recklessly chose to hold it despite exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Rupert expressed her frustration with the lack of cooperation, noting that many people were not answering their phones or providing false information. The refusal to cooperate jeopardizes the health and safety of the community and will not be tolerated, with non-compliance carrying a hefty fine of $2,000 per day. The officials pleaded for people to do the right thing and answer the calls, emphasizing their only goal is to keep the disease from spreading further. 

END OF SUMMARY.
