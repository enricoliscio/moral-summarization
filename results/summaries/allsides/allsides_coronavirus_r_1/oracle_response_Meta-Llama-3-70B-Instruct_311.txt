SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised" due to such behavior. The individuals, who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a June 17 party, have refused to answer phone calls or speak with health officials, hindering efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert expressed frustration, stating that some individuals deny attending the party or hang up on contact tracers, while others have parents answer for them, providing false information. Day urged individuals to "do the right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily cooperate with health officials. The subpoenas aim to compel the individuals to speak with contact tracers, with a daily fine of $2,000 for non-compliance. The goal is to stem the spread of the disease by notifying those who may have been exposed and requiring them to quarantine.
