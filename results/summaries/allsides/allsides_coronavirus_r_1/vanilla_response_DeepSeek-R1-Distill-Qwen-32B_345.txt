Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people who refused to speak with contact tracers. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

So, the officials issued subpoenas to eight people who were infected with COVID-19. They refused to talk to contact tracers, which is important for tracking the spread. The county executive, Ed Day, mentioned that their health isn't compromised by people's refusal. The health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, added that failure to comply would cost $2,000 per day. 

The subpoenas are to get these individuals to speak about a June 17 party in Clarkstown where they might have contracted the virus. These eight people didn't answer interview requests, which is necessary to find out who else they were in contact with to prevent further spread. Rupert is frustrated because some people hang up, deny being at the party, or don't answer their phones. She mentioned that even when their names were found through others, they still refused.

Day emphasized they don't want to punish anyone, just to get the information needed to stop the spread. Contact tracing is crucial for controlling the virus, so their refusal is hindering efforts. The party host had symptoms but still held the event, contributing to the cluster. Rockland County is struggling with this infection cluster that started at that party.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: subpoenas issued, reason for refusal, the party, consequences, and the importance of contact tracing. Make sure it's clear and concise, covering all main elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The subpoenas aim to compel them to discuss their potential exposure at a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the virus spread. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert stated that the individuals either hung up, denied attending the party, or ignored contact attempts, hindering efforts to track the virus. County Executive Ed Day emphasized that the goal is not punishment but to prevent further spread by identifying contacts. Contact tracing is crucial for controlling the outbreak, but the refusal to cooperate has forced the county to take legal action. The party host, who had symptoms, defied health guidelines by hosting the event, contributing to the infection cluster. END OF SUMMARY.
