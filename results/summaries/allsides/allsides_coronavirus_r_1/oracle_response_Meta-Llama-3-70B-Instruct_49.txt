SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have taken drastic measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. Eight individuals, allegedly infected with the coronavirus, have been issued subpoenas for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. According to County Executive Ed Day, "the health of our county will not be compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." The individuals' refusal to answer questions about their contacts has forced the county to resort to subpoenas, with a daily fine of $2,000 for non-compliance. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert expressed frustration, stating that many infected individuals are not answering their phones or refusing to talk, hindering efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus. The officials' goal is to stem the spread of the disease by notifying those who may have been in contact with the infected individuals and requiring them to quarantine for 14 days. The county's actions are a last resort to keep the community safe from the highly contagious disease.

END OF SUMMARY.
