SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason. The individuals, who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party, have declined interview requests, refused to answer phones, or denied attending the party despite evidence to the contrary. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized that the goal is to protect the community, not to punish individuals. They stressed that contact tracing is crucial to stemming the spread of the virus, and that the individuals' refusal to cooperate is compromising public health. The subpoenas carry a daily fine of $2,000 for non-compliance. Officials urged the individuals to do the "right thing" and voluntarily speak with health officials to prevent further spread of the virus.
