SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a strong stand against ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight subpoenas have been issued to individuals infected with the coronavirus who refused to voluntarily cooperate with contact tracers. These individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing is compromising the health of the entire county. 

The county executive, Ed Day, and the health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized that the subpoenas are a necessary measure to ensure the safety of the community. They aim to prevent further spread of the virus and keep residents safe. The infected individuals are not answering their phones or are refusing to provide information about their contacts, which is crucial to stemming the tide of this deadly and highly contagious disease. 

The host of the party is also under scrutiny, as they held the event despite exhibiting coronavirus symptoms. The health commissioner pleaded for cooperation, stating that the lack of compliance must stop. The county is struggling to contain the infection cluster that originated at the party, and the refusal of these individuals to cooperate is hindering their efforts. The officials are sending a clear message: failure to comply will not be tolerated, and those who refuse to do the right thing for their neighbors will face consequences. 

END OF SUMMARY.
