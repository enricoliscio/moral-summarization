Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people who refused to talk to contact tracers. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about officials in Rockland County subpoenaing eight individuals who were infected with COVID-19 for not cooperating with contact tracers. The officials are frustrated because these people aren't answering calls or refusing to talk, which hinders efforts to track the spread. They mention a party where the infection cluster started, and the host had symptoms but still held the event. The officials emphasize the importance of contact tracing and the necessity of cooperation to prevent further spread.

Now, the moral framing here is about responsibility and community impact. The officials are upset because the individuals' refusal to cooperate puts others at risk. They're highlighting the importance of doing the "right thing" for neighbors and the community. The article also touches on the consequences of ignoring public health measures, which is a moral issue of selfishness versus community welfare.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral aspect. I should mention the frustration of the officials, the refusal to cooperate, the impact on the community, and the use of subpoenas as a last resort. I'll also include the point about the party host ignoring symptoms, which adds to the moral judgment on ignoring public health guidelines.

I should structure the summary to first state the action (issuing subpoenas), then explain why (refusal to cooperate), the consequences (risk of spreading), and the officials' stance on community responsibility. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but include all these elements.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the officials issuing subpoenas to eight people. Then mention their refusal to speak with contact tracers. Highlight the frustration and the impact on the community. Include the party incident and the host's actions. Emphasize the importance of contact tracing and the moral obligation to cooperate. End with the officials' message about doing the right thing for neighbors.

I think that covers all the key points while preserving the moral framing. I'll make sure the language reflects the officials' frustration and the community's expectation to act responsibly.

SUMMARY:  
Officials in New York’s Rockland County have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert expressed frustration, stating that the refusal to provide information endangers public health and delays efforts to contain the virus. The individuals are linked to a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the host reportedly held the event despite experiencing symptoms. Rupert emphasized the importance of contact tracing to identify and isolate infected individuals, calling the refusal to cooperate “ignorant, stupid, or obstinate.” The county warned that non-compliance could result in daily fines of $2,000. Officials stressed that their goal is not to punish but to protect the community, urging individuals to “do the right thing” for their neighbors. Rupert also highlighted the challenges faced by health workers, as some individuals deny attendance at gatherings or refuse to respond to calls. The county is struggling to control a COVID-19 cluster linked to the party.  
END OF SUMMARY.
