Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it sound forced.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rockland County officials issuing subpoenas to eight people who refused to speak with contact tracers. They were at a party where COVID spread. The officials are frustrated because people aren't cooperating, leading to the use of subpoenas to get them to talk.

The author used words like "ignorance," "stupidity," "obstinance," "prevent," "refusing," "keep," "stem," etc. I need to incorporate these into the summary. I should start by mentioning the issuance of subpoenas, the refusal to speak, and the reasons behind it.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points: who, what, why. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to highlight the officials' frustration and the importance of cooperation in preventing the spread.

I should also mention the consequences of not complying, like the $2,000 fine, and the purpose of contact tracing. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too detailed.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the issuance of subpoenas, then the reason (refusal to speak), the frustration expressed by the officials using the moral terms, the purpose of contact tracing, and the consequences. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the necessary moral framing words.

I should check that I'm not adding any new information beyond what's in the article and that the summary accurately reflects the original content while emphasizing the moral aspects. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

Alright, putting it all together now, making sure to include the key moral words and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials in New York issued subpoenas to eight individuals allegedly infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day criticized those who ignored their obligations, stating, “The health of our county will not be compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance.” Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized the importance of preventing the virus’s spread by identifying contacts, adding that failure to comply would result in a $2,000 daily fine. The individuals, linked to a June 17 party, had either refused to answer calls or denied their attendance, despite evidence from others. Rupert stressed the need for cooperation to stem the virus’s spread, calling the refusal unacceptable. Contact tracing is essential to notify exposed individuals and keep the disease from spreading further. The officials stressed their desire for voluntary compliance, but the refusal to answer calls or provide information forced them to take legal action. END OF SUMMARY.
