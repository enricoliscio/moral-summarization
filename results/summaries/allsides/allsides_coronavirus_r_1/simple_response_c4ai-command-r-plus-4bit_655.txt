SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a strong moral stand against individuals who are compromising the well-being of their community by refusing to cooperate with contact tracing efforts. Eight subpoenas have been issued to infected individuals who attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown and are now unwilling to assist in identifying close contacts. County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasize that the subpoenas are a necessary measure to protect the health of the county, with each day of non-compliance costing $2,000. The officials' frustration is evident as they strive to do what is right for their neighbors, but are met with ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance. The host of the party, symptomatic of COVID-19, is also criticized for their irresponsible decision to hold the event. The lack of cooperation from attendees and their parents, who provide false information or refuse to answer calls, is hindering efforts to contain the infection cluster. The summary urges individuals to act responsibly and cooperate with health officials to protect their community's health and well-being.
