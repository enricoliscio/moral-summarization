Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people infected with COVID-19. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rockland County officials are issuing subpoenas to eight people who refused to speak with contact tracers. They're upset because these individuals aren't cooperating, which is hindering efforts to contain the virus. The officials are emphasizing the importance of contact tracing and the community's health.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspect. The officials are framing this as a responsibility to protect others, not just about the individuals' actions. They're frustrated because cooperation is essential, and refusal is putting others at risk.

I should include key details: the number of people subpoenaed, the reason (refusing contact tracing), the fines, the party where the outbreak started, and the officials' statements about community health. Also, mention the consequences of non-cooperation.

I'll structure the summary to start with the action (issuing subpoenas), explain why (refusal to cooperate), and then the officials' stance on community responsibility. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me draft it, ensuring all important points are covered without losing the moral angle. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed. Make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day emphasized the importance of protecting public health, stating that refusal to comply would result in daily fines of $2,000. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert explained that the individuals were linked to a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the host reportedly ignored symptoms and hosted the event. Contact tracers have faced challenges, with some individuals hanging up, denying attendance, or providing false information. Officials stress that cooperation is crucial to prevent further spread, as contact tracing is essential to identifying and isolating infected individuals. The county aims to protect the community by encouraging responsible behavior, but non-compliance has forced them to take legal action. Rupert highlighted the need for honesty and cooperation to control the outbreak. END OF SUMMARY.
