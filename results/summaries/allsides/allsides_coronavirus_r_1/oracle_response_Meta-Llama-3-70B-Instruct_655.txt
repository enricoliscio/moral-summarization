SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason for their actions. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised" due to their refusal to comply. The individuals, who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17, have declined interview requests, refusing to answer questions about who they came into contact with, thereby preventing health officials from stemming the spread of the virus. According to Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert, the infected partygoers are not answering their phones or refusing to talk when contact tracers reach out, forcing the county to resort to subpoenas. The officials' goal is to "keep" the virus from spreading by identifying and notifying those who may have been exposed, and requiring them to quarantine for 14 days. The refusal to cooperate has led to a struggle to contain the infection cluster.
