SUMMARY:

Officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17 and refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The county executive and health commissioner warned that failure to comply would result in a daily fine of $2,000. The individuals had declined interview requests to determine who else they came into contact with, potentially spreading the virus further. Health officials expressed frustration that the infected partygoers were not answering their phones or refusing to talk when contacted. The host of the party had coronavirus symptoms but still held the event. Contact tracing is crucial to stemming the spread of COVID-19, but officials in Rockland are struggling to contain the cluster that began at the party.

END OF SUMMARY.
