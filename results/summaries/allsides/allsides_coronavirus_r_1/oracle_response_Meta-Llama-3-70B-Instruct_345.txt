SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have taken drastic measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, issuing subpoenas to eight individuals who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. According to County Executive Ed Day, "the health of our county" will not be "compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." The individuals, who allegedly contracted the virus at a June 17 party, have been refusing to answer calls or speak with health officials, hindering efforts to prevent the further spread of the disease. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized that "failure to comply will be costly: $2,000 per day." The officials' goal is to stem the spread of the virus by identifying and notifying those who may have come into contact with the infected individuals. However, the refusal of the partygoers to answer questions and provide information has forced the county to resort to subpoenas. As Day urged, "we want people to do the right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily cooperate with health officials. END OF SUMMARY.
