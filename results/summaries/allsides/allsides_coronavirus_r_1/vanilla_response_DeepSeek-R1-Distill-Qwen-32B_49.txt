Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Rockland County in New York issuing subpoenas to eight people infected with COVID-19. They refused to speak with contact tracers. The officials mentioned that the health of the county is at risk because of people's refusal to cooperate. They also mentioned that those who don't comply will face a $2,000 daily fine.

The subpoenas are related to a June 17 party in Clarkstown where some attendees were infected. The host had symptoms but still held the event. The health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, said that these individuals are not answering calls or denying their attendance, even when their names were found through others.

Contact tracing is important because it helps identify who else might be infected, so they can quarantine and stop the spread. Rockland County is struggling with a cluster from that party, which shows why cooperation is crucial.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: subpoenas issued, reason for refusal, the party incident, the importance of contact tracing, and the consequences of non-compliance.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main action, then the reason, the context of the party, the officials' statements, and the importance of contact tracing.

Let me make sure I include all the essential details without going over the word limit. I'll avoid extra details and keep it concise.
