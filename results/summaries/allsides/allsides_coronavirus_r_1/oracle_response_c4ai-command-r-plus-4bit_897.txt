SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a strong stand against ignorance, obstinance, and stupidity in the face of a coronavirus outbreak. Eight subpoenas have been issued to individuals who are allegedly infected with the virus but refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, are sending a clear message that the health of the community must come first. The infected individuals attended a party in Clarkstown on June 17 and are now refusing to answer calls or provide information about their contacts. The county is using subpoenas to compel these individuals to cooperate, with a daily fine of $2,000 for non-compliance. This action is a last resort, as health officials stress that they simply want people to do the right thing and answer calls voluntarily. Unfortunately, the refusal of these individuals to cooperate is compromising the county's efforts to prevent the spread of the virus and keep their community safe. This situation highlights the challenges faced by contact tracers across the country and the importance of personal responsibility in stemming the tide of this deadly disease. END OF SUMMARY.
