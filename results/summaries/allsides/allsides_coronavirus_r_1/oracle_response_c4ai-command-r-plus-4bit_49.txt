SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a strong stand against ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Eight subpoenas have been issued to individuals allegedly infected with COVID-19 who are refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized the importance of protecting the health of the community and preventing further spread of the virus. The subpoenas carry a hefty fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. The officials expressed frustration at the refusal of the infected individuals to answer calls or provide information about their contacts, which is crucial for stemming the tide of the disease. The situation arose from a party held in Clarkstown on June 17, where the host, symptomatic of COVID-19, ignored health guidelines and held the gathering anyway. The county is now struggling to contain the infection cluster that resulted from this party. The officials implored residents to do the right thing and voluntarily speak to health officials, emphasizing that their goal is to protect the community and keep the disease from spreading further.
END OF SUMMARY.
