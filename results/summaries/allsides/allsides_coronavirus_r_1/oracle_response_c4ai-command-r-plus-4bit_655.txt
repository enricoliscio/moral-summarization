SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a strong stand against ignorance, obstinance, and stupidity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Eight subpoenas have been issued to individuals allegedly infected with COVID-19 who are refusing to cooperate with contact tracers, with County Executive Ed Day warning of costly consequences for their failure to comply. These individuals attended a party in Clarkstown on June 17 and are now jeopardizing the health of the entire county by refusing to answer calls and provide information about their contacts. The subpoenas are a last resort, according to Day, who stressed that the goal is to prevent further spread of the virus and keep the community safe. Rockland County Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert echoed this sentiment, expressing frustration at the lack of cooperation and stressing the importance of contact tracing in stemming the tide of COVID-19 infections. The county is facing a challenging cluster of infections stemming from the party, and the refusal of these individuals to answer calls and provide information is compromising their efforts to contain the outbreak. This must stop, Rupert asserted, calling for a collective effort to do what is right for the community.
END OF SUMMARY.
