Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Rockland County officials issuing subpoenas to eight people infected with COVID-19 who refused to talk with contact tracers. They held a party despite knowing about the virus, and now the county is using legal action to get them to cooperate. The officials express frustration, using terms like "ignorance," "stupidity," and "obstinance." They emphasize the importance of contact tracing to prevent the spread and keep the community safe. 

I should make sure to include those morally charged words in the summary. I'll need to condense the information, focusing on the key actions and the moral implications. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens. Let me structure it by mentioning the subpoenas, the reasons behind them, the officials' frustration, the refusal to cooperate, and the importance of contact tracing. I'll also highlight the negative behaviors like ignoring calls and denying attendance. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary elements without being too lengthy. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the morally framed words and the essential details about the party and the spread of the virus.

SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day criticized their "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance," while Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized the need to "prevent" further spread by identifying contacts. The individuals allegedly attended a June 17 party in Clarkstown, where the host had symptoms but proceeded despite the risk. Rupert expressed frustration, noting that many "refused" to answer calls or denied attendance, even when their names were confirmed by others. The goal of contact tracing is to "stem" the virus's spread by notifying exposed individuals to "keep" the community safe. The county warned of daily $2,000 fines for noncompliance, stressing that cooperation is essential to "prevent" further infections. END OF SUMMARY.
