SUMMARY:
Rockland County officials announced on Wednesday that they have issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The county executive, Ed Day, and the health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized the importance of compliance in protecting "the health of our county." The subpoenas carry a hefty fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. The infected individuals attended a party in Clarkstown on June 17, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing efforts is compromising the county's ability to stem the spread of the virus. Rupert expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation, stating that many of those infected are not answering calls, denying attendance at the party, or providing false information. She emphasized that "this must stop" as it hinders the efforts to contain the outbreak. The county is facing an outbreak stemming from the party, and the officials' moral duty is to protect the community from further harm. The officials stressed that their actions are not intended to get anyone in trouble but to do the right thing for their neighbors and prevent further spread of the disease. Day and Rupert urged the infected individuals to cooperate voluntarily for the greater good. END OF SUMMARY.
