SUMMARY: Ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance are compromising the health of Rockland County, New York, according to County Executive Ed Day. Eight people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus are refusing to speak with contact tracers, and the county has been forced to issue subpoenas to compel them to cooperate. These individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing is hindering efforts to prevent further spread of the virus. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized the seriousness of the matter, stating that failure to comply with the subpoenas would result in a $2,000 per day fine. The county officials' frustration is evident as they struggle to contain a coronavirus infection cluster stemming from the party. They appeal to the public's sense of moral duty, urging people to do the right thing for their neighbors by voluntarily cooperating with health authorities. However, the lack of cooperation and responsibility demonstrated by the infected individuals and their contacts is endangering the community and undermining the efforts to control the pandemic.

END OF SUMMARY.
