SUMMARY:
In Rockland County, New York, officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who have refused to cooperate with contact tracers, citing "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance" as the reason. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised" due to their actions. The individuals, who were allegedly infected with COVID-19 at a June 17 party, have refused to answer calls or provide information, forcing officials to take drastic measures. Day urged them to do the "right thing for their neighbors" and voluntarily speak with health officials. However, their "refusal" to cooperate has led to the issuance of subpoenas, which will result in a "costly" fine of $2,000 per day. The officials are struggling to contain a coronavirus infection cluster that began at the party, and their lack of "cooperation" is hindering efforts to stem the disease's spread. END OF SUMMARY.
