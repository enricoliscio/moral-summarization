SUMMARY:
In Rockland County, New York, officials are taking drastic measures to contain a COVID-19 cluster that originated from a June 17 party. Eight individuals who allegedly contracted the virus are refusing to cooperate with contact tracers, prompting the issuance of subpoenas. County Executive Ed Day emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be "compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." Failure to comply with the subpoenas will result in a "costly" fine of $2,000 per day. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert expressed frustration over the individuals' "refusal" to answer phone calls or provide information, forcing the county to take action. The officials' goal is to do the "right" thing and protect the community by tracing contacts and requiring quarantine. Rupert stressed that "cooperation" is "necessary" to stem the spread of the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
