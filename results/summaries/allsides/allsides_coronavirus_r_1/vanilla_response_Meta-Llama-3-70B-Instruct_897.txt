SUMMARY:

Officials in Rockland County, New York, have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 at a party on June 17. The individuals had refused to cooperate with contact tracers, ignoring requests to discuss who they had been in contact with. The county executive and health commissioner warned that failure to comply would result in a $2,000 per day fine. The officials expressed frustration, stating that the infected individuals were not answering their phones or refusing to talk when contacted. The host of the party had coronavirus symptoms but still held the event. Contact tracing is crucial in stemming the spread of COVID-19, and officials are struggling to contain a cluster of infections that began at the party. The goal of contact tracing is to notify those who may have been exposed and require them to quarantine for 14 days.
