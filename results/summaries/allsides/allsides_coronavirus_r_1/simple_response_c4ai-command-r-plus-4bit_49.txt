SUMMARY: Health officials in Rockland County, New York, are taking a hard line against residents who are refusing to cooperate with contact tracing efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. Eight people who attended a party on June 17 and are believed to be infected with the coronavirus are refusing to speak with contact tracers and provide information about their close contacts. The county has issued subpoenas to these individuals, threatening fines of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. The officials argue that their actions are necessary to protect the health and safety of the community and that the refusal to cooperate is selfish and irresponsible. They emphasize that contact tracing is a crucial tool in the fight against the pandemic and that the consequences of non-cooperation could be dire. The county is facing challenges in containing an infection cluster linked to the party, and the lack of cooperation from the attendees is hindering their efforts. The officials appeal to the public's sense of civic duty and urge residents to do the right thing by cooperating with health authorities to prevent further spread of the disease.
