SUMMARY:  
Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day criticized their "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance," emphasizing that failure to comply could result in a $2,000 daily fine. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert explained that the individuals declined to answer calls or provide information about their contacts, hindering efforts to "prevent" further spread. The subpoenas aim to compel them to speak with tracers about a June 17 party where the virus likely spread. Rupert expressed frustration, noting that some individuals hung up, denied attending the party, or provided false information. Contact tracing is essential to "stem" the virus's spread by identifying those exposed and requiring quarantine. The officials stressed that cooperation is crucial to "keep" the community safe, urging individuals to "do the right thing" for their neighbors. However, their refusal to answer or provide information has forced the county to take legal action. END OF SUMMARY.
