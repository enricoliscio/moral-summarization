SUMMARY:
In Rockland County, New York, officials are taking drastic measures to contain a coronavirus cluster that originated from a June 17 party. Eight individuals, allegedly infected with COVID-19, have been issued subpoenas for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers voluntarily. According to County Executive Ed Day, "the health of our county" will not be "compromised because of ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance." The refusal to comply will come at a "costly" price of $2,000 per day. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized that the goal is to "do the right thing for their neighbors" and prevent further spread of the virus. However, the infected individuals' "refusal" to talk has "forced" the county to resort to subpoenas. Rupert stressed that "cooperation" is "necessary" to stem the spread of the disease. The officials are determined to "stop" the spread of the virus, even if it means taking a tough stance. END OF SUMMARY.
