SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The subpoenas carry a fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. The infected individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing efforts is hindering the county's ability to contain the spread of the virus. 

County Executive Ed Day and Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert emphasized that the subpoenas are a last resort and that their priority is protecting the health of the community. Rupert described the challenges faced by contact tracers, including people hanging up, denying attendance at the party, or refusing to provide information. 

The situation in Rockland County highlights the importance of contact tracing in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and the challenges faced by health officials when individuals are uncooperative. Local news reports indicate that the county is struggling to contain an infection cluster that originated at the June 17 party.
