SUMMARY: Rockland County officials have been forced to issue subpoenas and threaten fines to people who are allegedly infected with coronavirus and refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. This moral outrage is a direct result of people prioritizing their own selfish interests over the health and safety of their community. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, have rightly expressed their frustration at the irresponsible behavior of those who attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown and are now refusing to help prevent further spread of the virus. Their refusal to cooperate is a blatant disregard for the well-being of their neighbors and is unacceptable. The county is taking the necessary steps to hold these individuals accountable and prevent further harm. The host of the party, who had coronavirus symptoms, acted with negligence and a blatant disregard for the health of others by choosing to hold the event anyway. This shameful incident underscores the ongoing challenge faced by health officials across the country, who are working tirelessly to contain the spread of COVID-19. The selfish actions of a few are endangering the lives of many, and it is crucial that we all do our part to stop the spread of this deadly disease. END OF SUMMARY.
