SUMMARY:
Rockland County officials issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. Ed Day, the county executive, expressed frustration at the individuals' ignorance, stupidity, and obstinance, emphasizing the importance of doing the right thing for their neighbors. The subpoenas carry a hefty fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. Patricia Rupert, the health commissioner, explained that the subpoenas are a last resort to prevent the further spread of the virus. The infected individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing is compromising the health of the county. Rupert highlighted the lack of necessary cooperation and the importance of stopping the spread of misinformation, such as parents promising their adult children have been home when they have not. Local health officials stressed that contact tracing is essential to containing the COVID-19 outbreak. The county is currently struggling to contain a coronavirus cluster that originated at the party. The subpoenas are meant to compel the infected individuals to disclose their contacts to prevent further spread of the disease. Day assured that the goal is not to get anyone in trouble but to protect the community by identifying those at risk of infection. END OF SUMMARY.
