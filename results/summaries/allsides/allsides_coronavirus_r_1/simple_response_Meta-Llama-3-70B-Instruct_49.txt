SUMMARY:

In Rockland County, New York, officials have taken drastic measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. Eight individuals who attended a party on June 17, where the host had coronavirus symptoms, have been subpoenaed for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. The county executive, Ed Day, emphasized that the "health of our county" will not be compromised by "ignorance, stupidity, or obstinacy." The officials' goal is to identify and notify those who may have been infected, requiring them to quarantine for 14 days. However, the infected individuals have been uncooperative, refusing to answer calls or denying their attendance at the party. The county's health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, stressed that the lack of cooperation is hindering efforts to stem the disease's spread. The officials are urging individuals to do the right thing for their neighbors and voluntarily speak with health officials. Failure to comply with the subpoenas will result in a daily fine of $2,000.
