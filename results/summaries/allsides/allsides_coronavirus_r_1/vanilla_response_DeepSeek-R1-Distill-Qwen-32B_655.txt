Alright, I need to summarize this news article about New York's Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people infected with COVID-19. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

So, the main points are that Rockland County officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who refused to speak with contact tracers. The reason is that these people attended a June 17 party in Clarkstown where the virus spread. The county exec and health commissioner are frustrated because these individuals aren't cooperating, which is hindering contact tracing efforts. The goal of contact tracing is to identify others who might have been exposed and prevent further spread.

I should mention the consequences of not complying, which is a $2,000 daily fine. Also, the host of the party had symptoms but still held the event. The officials are emphasizing that they don't want to punish people but need their cooperation to protect the community.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Rockland County issued subpoenas to eight people for refusing contact tracing. Then explain the context of the party and the refusal to cooperate. Include the fines and the officials' statements about their intentions. Finally, mention the importance of contact tracing in controlling the spread.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the action (subpoenas), the reason (refusing to talk with contact tracers), the context (party leading to infections), the consequences (fines), and the officials' stance (desire for cooperation, not punishment). Make sure to include the health officials' points about the necessity of contact tracing.

I should avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main elements. Keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft it:

Rockland County officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals who allegedly contracted COVID-19 after refusing to engage with contact tracers. The individuals attended a June 17 party where the virus spread. The health department is frustrated by their refusal to cooperate, hindering efforts to trace contacts and prevent further transmission. Failure to comply could result in a $2,000 daily fine. Officials emphasize their goal is to protect public health, not punish individuals, by identifying and isolating those exposed to the virus.

Wait, that's under 200 words. Let me check if I included all key points: subpoenas, refusal, party context, fines, officials' intentions, contact tracing importance. Yes, seems covered. Maybe add a bit more about the party host having symptoms to show why it's important.

Revised:

Rockland County officials have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to speak with contact tracers. These individuals attended a June 17 party where the virus spread, despite the host showing symptoms. The county is frustrated by their refusal to cooperate, which hinders contact tracing efforts to identify and isolate exposed individuals. Failure to comply could result in a $2,000 daily fine. Officials stress their aim is to protect public health, not punish, by preventing further transmission.

That's better. It includes the host's symptoms, the fines, and the officials' intentions. Now, let me count the words. It's concise and under 200 words. I think this covers all necessary information effectively.
