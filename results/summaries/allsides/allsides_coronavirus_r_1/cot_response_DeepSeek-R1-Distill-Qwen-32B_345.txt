Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about New Yorkâ€™s Rockland County issuing subpoenas to people infected with COVID-19 for refusing to speak with contact tracers. The task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment or imply right and wrong. So, I should go through the article and pick out words that have such connotations.

Looking at the article, words like "ignorance," "stupidity," "obstinance," "cooperate," "right thing," "neighbors," "refuse," "deny," "hang up," "unfortunately," "struggling," "stop," "deadly," "contagious," and "cluster" stand out. These words carry moral implications, either criticizing the individuals' actions or emphasizing the importance of cooperation.

Next, I need to summarize the article while keeping these moral words intact. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the issuance of subpoenas, the reason behind it (failure to cooperate with contact tracers), the frustration of health officials, the impact on the community, and the essential nature of contact tracing.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral framing. Start by stating the issuance of subpoenas, mention the refusal to cooperate, the consequences, and the officials' emphasis on the community's well-being. Make sure to include the moral words to convey the tone and message accurately.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed. It's important to balance brevity with completeness, making sure the moral perspective isn't lost.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and that all morally framed words are appropriately included. This way, the summary not only informs but also reflects the original article's moral stance on the issue.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rockland County officials in New York have issued subpoenas to eight individuals infected with COVID-19 for refusing to cooperate with contact tracers. County Executive Ed Day emphasized the importance of protecting public health, stating that ignorance, stupidity, or obstinance would not compromise community safety. Health Commissioner Patricia Rupert explained that the individuals had declined to speak with contact tracers, hindering efforts to trace the spread of the virus from a June 17 party. She expressed frustration that some partygoers hung up, denied attendance, or failed to return calls, even when their names were provided by others. Rupert stressed the need for cooperation to prevent further spread, as contact tracing is essential to controlling the virus. Day reiterated that the goal is to protect neighbors by identifying those who may have been exposed. The county is struggling to contain a coronavirus cluster linked to the party, and officials warn that failure to comply with subpoenas could result in fines of $2,000 per day. END OF SUMMARY.
