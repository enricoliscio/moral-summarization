SUMMARY: Rockland County officials in New York issued subpoenas to eight people infected with coronavirus who refused to cooperate with contact tracers. The subpoenas carry a fine of $2,000 per day for non-compliance. The infected individuals attended a party on June 17 in Clarkstown, and their refusal to participate in contact tracing efforts is hindering the county's ability to contain the spread of the virus. The county executive, Ed Day, and health commissioner, Patricia Rupert, emphasized that the subpoenas are a last resort to protect the health of the community. Rupert also expressed frustration with the lack of cooperation from the infected individuals and their contacts, noting that many do not answer calls or provide accurate information. Local news reports suggest that Rockland County is facing challenges in containing a coronavirus cluster linked to the June 17 party.
END OF SUMMARY.
