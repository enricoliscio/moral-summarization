SUMMARY:

Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations, which would benefit President Trump. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, but only about the public announcement, which would allow him to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump's goal was to get Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America, by investigating the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server. Sondland's words also implicated Vice President Pence, who allegedly nodded in agreement when informed about the aid being held up pending investigations. The testimony exposed Trump's shakedown of Ukraine, where he sought to massage the narrative to fit his own interests, and engaged in meddling and interference in Ukraine's affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
