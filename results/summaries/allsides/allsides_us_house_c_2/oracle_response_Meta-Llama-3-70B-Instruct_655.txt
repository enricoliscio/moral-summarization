SUMMARY:

Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine took action on a public statement, which was code for investigating the Bidens. Sondland also testified that he told Vice President Pence that the aid was being held up pending investigations, and Pence just nodded. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement of them, which would give him material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. Sondland's testimony made it clear that Trump wanted Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America in 2016, by investigating the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server. Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid to Ukraine and investigations, but Sondland's own words revealed the shakedown.

END OF SUMMARY.
