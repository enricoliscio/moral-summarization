SUMMARY:
Gordon Sondland's testimony in the impeachment hearings revealed his knowledge of the quid pro quo arrangement with Ukraine. He communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent upon Ukraine announcing investigations into the Bidens and the DNC server, which would provide Trump with material to *defame Biden and shift blame from Russia for election interference. Sondland also testified about a call with Trump, where he said Trump didn't care about Ukraine but only about "big stuff" that benefits himself. Republicans have tried to spin Trump's claims of Ukrainian *meddling, but Sondland's testimony made clear Trump wanted Ukraine to help *exonerate Russia for its attack on America. While Sondland is not a *wholly reliable witness, his testimony corroborates other witnesses' accounts and reveals the *ugliest aspects of Trump's *shakedown. Sondland's testimony paints a disturbing picture of a president willing to sacrifice national security and abuse his power for personal gain.
