Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the testimony of Gordon Sondland regarding the Ukraine aid and the investigations into the 2016 election. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that Sondland told a Ukrainian official that U.S. aid wouldn't resume until Ukraine took some action related to a public statement they'd been discussing. He also mentioned to Mike Pence that the aid was held up due to pending investigations, but Pence's chief of staff denied this. 

Then, Sondland didn't dispute the testimony of David Holmes, who said he overheard a call where Sondland told Trump that Ukraine would do whatever the president wanted. After the call, Sondland reportedly said Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only the "big stuff" that benefits him. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, just the public announcement of them, which would help Trump defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election.

The article also mentions that some Republicans tried to downplay Trump's claims about Ukrainian election interference, but Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC. Sondland emphasized the "DNC server" in his testimony, indicating the focus was on exonerating Russia. However, Sondland's credibility is questioned because he claimed ignorance about the connection between Burisma and the Bidens, which is seen as unbelievable. Republicans might use his statement that he never heard Trump directly link aid to investigations, instead, he inferred it as "two plus two equals four."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main points: Sondland's communication about aid resumption, the role of public statements, Trump's focus on exonerating Russia, Sondland's credibility issues, and the Republican angle.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Sondland's role in the aid suspension, then move to the call with Trump, the public announcement aspect, the DNC server point, and end with the credibility and Republican stance. Make sure it's concise and covers all key elements without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: Gordon Sondland testified that U.S. aid to Ukraine would resume only if Ukraine pursued investigations into the 2016 election, specifically the DNC server, to exonerate Russia. He claimed Trump only cared about the public announcement of these investigations, not their execution, to defame Biden. Sondland's credibility was questioned as he denied knowing the Burisma-Biden connection. Republicans may focus on his statement that Trump never directly linked aid to investigations, inferring it as "two plus two equals four." END OF SUMMARY.
