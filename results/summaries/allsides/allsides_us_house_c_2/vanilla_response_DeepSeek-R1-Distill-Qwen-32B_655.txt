Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article talks about Sondland's testimony regarding the Ukraine aid and investigations. He communicated to a Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would resume only if Ukraine took some action on a public statement they'd been discussing. He told Pence that the aid was held up pending investigations, but Pence's staff denied that. 

Then there's the part about Holmes, a U.S. Embassy official, who overheard a call Sondland made to Trump. On that call, Trump asked if Ukraine would pursue investigations. Sondland said they'd do whatever the president wanted. After the call, Sondland told Holmes that Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only about "big stuff" that benefits him. 

Sondland testified that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, just the public announcement. The goal was to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. 

The article also mentions Republicans trying to downplay Trump's claims about Ukraine interfering in the election. Nunes accused Ukraine of meddling through public statements, but Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the DNC server, specifically the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked it. 

Sondland's credibility is questioned because he claimed ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens, which seems unlikely. Republicans might focus on Sondland's statement that he never heard Trump directly link aid to investigations, but he inferred it because "two plus two equals four."

So, the summary needs to capture these key points: Sondland's communication about aid and public statements, Trump's focus on public announcements, the DNC server investigation, and the political implications. It should be concise, under 200 words, and structured clearly.
