SUMMARY:

Ambassador Sondland's testimony revealed that President Trump's true intention behind asking Ukraine for "investigations" was to get a public announcement that would help him defame Joe Biden and shift the blame for 2016 election interference from Russia to Ukraine. Sondland communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine took action on the public statement. He also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement that would benefit him. This is a clear abuse of power, as Trump was using his position to coerce a foreign government into doing his political bidding. The Republicans' attempts to spin this as Ukraine's fault are misleading and ignore the fact that public officials expressing opinions is not equivalent to interfering in an election. Sondland's testimony exposed Trump's true motives and highlighted the immorality of his actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
