Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sondland's testimony. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about Sondland communicating to a Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would resume only if Ukraine took some action related to a public statement they'd been discussing. He also told Pence that aid was held up pending investigations, but Pence's staff denied that. Sondland didn't dispute Holmes' testimony about overhearing a call where Trump asked if Ukrainians would pursue investigations. Sondland said Ukraine would do whatever the president wanted, and Trump didn't care about Ukraine itself, only the "big stuff" that benefits him. 

Sondland mentioned that Trump only cared about the public announcement of investigations, not the actual investigations. This was to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Republicans tried to downplay Trump's claims, but Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the DNC server, exonerating Russia. Sondland claimed ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens, which seems unreliable. Republicans might use his statement that he never heard Trump link aid to investigations directly, but Sondland inferred it.

So, the main points are: Sondland's communication about aid conditional on public statements, Trump's focus on public announcements to defame Biden, the DNC server investigation, Sondland's credibility issues, and Republican attempts to downplay the links.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, using the specified tokens. I'll structure it by highlighting Sondland's testimony, the conditions for aid, Trump's motivations, the DNC server, Sondland's credibility, and Republican responses.

SUMMARY:  
Sondland testified that U.S. aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine making a public statement about investigations, particularly into the DNC server, to benefit Trump politically. He claimed Trump cared only about the public announcement, not the actual investigations, to defame Biden and obscure Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland also stated Trump wanted Ukraine to exonerate Russia, despite his earlier claims of Ukrainian interference. Republicans downplayed Trump's claims, but Sondland's testimony clarified Trump's focus on the DNC server. Sondland's credibility was questioned, as he claimed ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens. Republicans may highlight that Sondland never heard Trump directly link aid to investigations, though he inferred the connection.  
END OF SUMMARY.
