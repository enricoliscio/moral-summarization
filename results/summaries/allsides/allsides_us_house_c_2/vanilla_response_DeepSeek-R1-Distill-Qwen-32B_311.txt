Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Sondland's testimony. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article talks about how Sondland communicated to a Ukrainian official that U.S. aid was tied to certain actions, like investigations. He mentioned that the aid wouldn't resume until Ukraine made a public statement about these investigations. He also told Pence about this, but Pence's staff denied it. 

Then there's the part about Sondland's call with Trump, where he asked if Ukraine would pursue the investigations. Sondland said they'd do whatever the president wanted. After the call, Sondland told Holmes that Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only about the "big stuff" that benefits him. 

Sondland emphasized that Trump wasn't focused on the investigations themselves but on their public announcement. This would help Trump defame Biden and shift blame from Russia. 

The article also mentions Republicans trying to downplay Trump's claims about Ukraine interfering in the election. Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the DNC server, which ties back to the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked it. 

However, Sondland's credibility is questioned because he claimed ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens, which seems unbelievable. He also said he never heard Trump directly link aid to investigations but inferred it himself. 

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Sondland's testimony linking aid to investigations, Trump's focus on public announcements, the DNC server angle, and Sondland's credibility issues. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.
