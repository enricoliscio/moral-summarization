SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland revealed that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on the country taking action on the public statement regarding investigations. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about actual investigations but only wanted a public announcement of them to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in his election. Republicans have tried to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, accusing Ukraine of meddling through public statements. However, Sondland's testimony made clear that Trump wanted investigations into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the DNC, seeking to exonerate Russia for its attack on the US. Sondland's insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is not credible, and he likely tried to distance himself from the shakedown. Republicans will likely focus on Sondland's statement that he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between aid and investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
