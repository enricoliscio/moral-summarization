SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not be resumed until Ukraine took action on a public statement, which would benefit President Trump. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but rather the public announcement of them, which would allow him to defame Joe Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Trump wanted Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America, and Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference were a sham. Republicans tried to massage Trump's claims, but Sondland's testimony showed that Trump's goal was to get Ukraine to announce investigations, not actually conduct them. This was a clear case of meddling and interference, and Sondland's testimony exposed Trump's shakedown of Ukraine. 

END OF SUMMARY.
