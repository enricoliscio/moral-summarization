Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

The article discusses Sondland's testimony regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine and Trump's involvement in pressuring Ukraine for investigations. Key points include Sondland linking aid resumption to public statements about investigations, Trump's focus on public announcements rather than actual investigations, and the goal to defame Biden and muddy the waters regarding Russia's role in the 2016 election. There's also mention of Republicans trying to massage Trump's claims about Ukrainian interference, which Sondland clarifies was about the DNC server, not public statements. Sondland's credibility is questioned, and the term "shakedown" is used to describe Trump's actions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral terms: defame, muddy, elected, massage, interference, meddling, hacked, attack, shakedown.

I should start by stating Sondland's role in linking aid to public statements, Trump's focus on announcements to defame Biden and muddy the election narrative. Mention Republicans trying to massage Trump's claims, but Sondland clarifies it's about DNC server. Highlight the shakedown aspect and Sondland's questionable credibility.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, includes all key points, and uses the moral terms appropriately without making it too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence captures an essential point and incorporates the necessary words.

SUMMARY:  
Sondland testified that U.S. aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine making a public statement about investigations, which Trump wanted to defame Biden and muddy the narrative around Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Trump cared only about the public announcement, not the actual investigations, as Sondland explained. Republicans tried to massage Trump’s claims of Ukrainian election interference, but Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server. Sondland emphasized that Trump’s goal was to exonerate Russia, not address public statements. Despite Sondland’s claims of ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens, his testimony revealed Trump’s shakedown, where aid was linked to political favors. Sondland admitted he inferred the connection between aid and investigations, stating “two plus two equals four.” END OF SUMMARY.
