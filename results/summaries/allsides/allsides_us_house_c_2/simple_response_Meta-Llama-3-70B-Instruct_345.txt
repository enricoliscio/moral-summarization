SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigating the 2016 election. Sondland also testified that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, but only about the public announcement that would benefit him. This announcement would allow Trump to defame Joe Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony exposed Trump's true intentions: to use Ukraine to exonerate Russia for its attack on America and to smear his political opponent. The moral implication is clear: Trump's actions were a gross abuse of power, driven by self-interest and a desire to undermine the integrity of the electoral process.

END OF SUMMARY.
