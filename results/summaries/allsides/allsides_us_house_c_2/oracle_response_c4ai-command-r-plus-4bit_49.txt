SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland revealed that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on Ukraine taking action on public statements regarding investigations. Sondland's testimony indicated that Trump was more interested in the public announcement of investigations, which would provide material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in his election. Republicans have attempted to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, accusing Ukraine of meddling through public statements. However, Sondland's testimony made clear that Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC, and sought to exonerate Russia for its attack on America. Sondland's insistence on his ignorance of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is not credible, and he likely wanted to distance himself from the ugliest aspect of Trump's shakedown. Republicans will likely focus on Sondland's statement that he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between aid and investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
