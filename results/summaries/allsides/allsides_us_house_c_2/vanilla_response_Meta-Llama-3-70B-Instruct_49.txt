SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine took action on a public statement regarding investigations. Sondland also testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, but Pence's chief of staff denied this. Sondland confirmed a call with Trump, where Trump asked if Ukraine would pursue investigations, and Sondland replied that they would do whatever Trump wanted. Sondland testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but rather the public announcement, which would benefit Trump. The public announcement would allow Trump to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony contradicts Republican claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.

END OF SUMMARY.
