SUMMARY:
Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement regarding investigations. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement, which would give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. This is a clear example of Trump's "shakedown" of Ukraine. Sondland's testimony also made it plain that Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C. server. This is an "insane" claim, and Sondland's insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is "preposterous". The whole ordeal reeks of Trump's "ugliest" aspects, and it's clear that he only cares about what benefits him, not the well-being of Ukraine or the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
