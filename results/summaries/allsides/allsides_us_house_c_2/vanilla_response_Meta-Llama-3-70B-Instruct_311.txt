SUMMARY:

Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not be resumed until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations. He also testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that the aid was being held up pending investigations, which Pence's chief of staff denied. Sondland confirmed that he told President Trump that Ukraine would do whatever he wanted, and that Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only about the "big stuff" that benefited him. Sondland revealed that Trump wanted a public announcement of investigations, not the actual investigations themselves, to defame Joe Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Republicans tried to downplay Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, but Sondland's testimony made it clear that Trump wanted Ukraine to exonerate Russia for its attack on America.

END OF SUMMARY.
