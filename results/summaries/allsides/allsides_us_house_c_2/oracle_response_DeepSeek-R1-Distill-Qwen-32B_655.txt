Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user wants the summary to include as many of those words as possible and to keep it under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Sondland's testimony regarding the Ukraine aid and the investigations into Biden and the DNC server. The key moral words here are defame, muddy, elected, massage, interference, meddling, hacked, attack, shakedown.

I should start by identifying the main events: Sondland communicated that aid was tied to investigations, Pence's nod, Holmes overhearing the call where Trump asked about investigations, Sondland's comment about Trump not caring about Ukraine, and the focus on public announcements to defame Biden. Also, Republicans tried to massage Trump's claims, and Sondland's unreliability as a witness.

I need to make sure to include all the moral words. I'll structure the summary to flow from Sondland's communication to the implications of the investigations, Trump's focus on public announcements, the Republicans' actions, and Sondland's credibility issues.

I'll also need to keep the summary concise. I'll start by mentioning Sondland's communication about aid resumption, then the call details, Trump's focus on public announcements, the intent to defame Biden, Republicans' attempts to massage claims, and Sondland's unreliability. Finally, I'll note that Republicans might rely on Sondland's statement about not hearing Trump directly link aid to investigations.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me draft the summary and count the words. If it's over, I'll trim some parts without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Sondland testified that U.S. aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine pursuing investigations, specifically the public announcement of probes into the DNC server and Burisma, to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia’s role in the 2016 election. He claimed Trump only cared about the public announcement, not the actual investigations. Sondland also revealed Trump’s disregard for Ukraine’s interests, focusing instead on “big stuff” benefiting him. Republicans tried to massage Trump’s claims of Ukrainian interference, but Sondland clarified Trump sought an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC. Sondland’s credibility was questioned, as he claimed ignorance of the Burisma-Biden connection. Despite this, Republicans may rely on his testimony that he never heard Trump directly link aid to investigations, but inferred the connection himself. END OF SUMMARY.
