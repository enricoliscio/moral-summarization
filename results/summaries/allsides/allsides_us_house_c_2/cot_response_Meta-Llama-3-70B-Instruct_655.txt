SUMMARY:
Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement they had been discussing for many weeks. He believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and Vice President Mike Pence nodded in agreement. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only about the "big stuff" that benefits him, and that he wanted a public announcement of investigations to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. Sondland's insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is hardly credible, and his testimony exposed the "ugly" and "insane" nature of Trump's claims. The public comments by Ukrainian officials are not what Trump had in mind, and Sondland's testimony made it plain that Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C.
