SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not be resumed until Ukraine took action on a public statement regarding investigations. He also testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that the aid was being held up pending investigations, but Pence's chief of staff denied this. Sondland confirmed that he had a conversation with President Trump, in which Trump asked about the status of investigations in Ukraine. Sondland said that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, but rather the public announcement of them, which would benefit him. Sondland's testimony also revealed that Trump's goal was to get Ukraine to announce investigations into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server in 2016, in order to exonerate Russia for its attack on America.
