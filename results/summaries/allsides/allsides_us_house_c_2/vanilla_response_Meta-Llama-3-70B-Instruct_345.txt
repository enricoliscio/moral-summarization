SUMMARY:

Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not be resumed until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations. He also testified that he told VP Mike Pence that the aid was being held up pending investigations, but Pence's chief of staff denied this. Sondland confirmed a call with Trump, where Trump asked if Ukraine would pursue investigations, and Sondland replied that they would do what Trump wanted. Sondland testified that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, but about the public announcement, which would benefit Trump. The public announcement would allow Trump to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony contradicts Republican claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, and instead supports the notion that Trump wanted Ukraine to exonerate Russia for its attack on America.

END OF SUMMARY.
