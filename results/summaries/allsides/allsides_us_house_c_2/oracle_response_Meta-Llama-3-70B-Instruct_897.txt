SUMMARY:

Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations. He also told Vice President Pence that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but only about the public announcement to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Trump wanted Ukraine's help to exonerate Russia for its attack on America, and Sondland's testimony made it plain that public comments by Ukrainian officials were not what Trump had in mind. Instead, Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C. server. Sondland's insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is hardly credible, and Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid and investigations.

END OF SUMMARY.
