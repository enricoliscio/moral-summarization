SUMMARY:
Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that the resumption of U.S. aid was contingent upon Ukraine taking action on a public statement, which was likely a reference to investigations into the 2016 election. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but rather the public announcement of them, which would give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference were based on a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C. Republicans tried to massage Trump's claims, but Sondland's testimony made it plain that Trump wanted Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America. Sondland's insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens is hardly credible, and his testimony exposed the ugly aspects of Trump's shakedown. END OF SUMMARY.
