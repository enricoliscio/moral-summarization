SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland revealed that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into the Bidens and the DNC server, even if they didn't actually carry them out. Sondland's testimony also made clear that Trump sought Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on the US election, despite Republicans' attempts to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian interference. Sondland's credibility is questioned due to his denial of knowledge about the connection between Burisma and the Bidens. Republicans will likely focus on Sondland's statement that he never heard directly from Trump about the linkage between aid and investigations. Nonetheless, Sondland's testimony provides significant insight into Trump's attempts to use Ukraine to gain political benefit and deflect attention from Russia's election interference. 

END OF SUMMARY.
