SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland revealed that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on the country taking action on public statements regarding investigations. Sondland's testimony also suggested that Trump was more concerned about the public announcement of investigations, which could be used to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in his election. Republicans have attempted to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, accusing Ukraine of meddling through public statements. However, Sondland's testimony indicated that Trump wanted an inquiry into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC, and wanted Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on the US. Sondland's reliability as a witness is questionable, particularly regarding his knowledge of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens. Republicans will likely focus on Sondland's statement that he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between aid and investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
