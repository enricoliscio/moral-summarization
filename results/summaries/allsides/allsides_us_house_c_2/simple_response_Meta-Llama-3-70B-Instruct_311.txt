SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, a key figure in the Ukraine scandal, testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but only about the public announcement, which would give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump's true intention was to get Ukraine to exonerate Russia for its attack on America, not to investigate Ukraine's alleged interference. Sondland's credibility is questionable, as he claimed to be ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens, a claim that is hardly believable. Republicans may cling to Sondland's statement that he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid and investigations, but Sondland's own words reveal the corrupt nature of Trump's demands.

END OF SUMMARY.
