SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland stated that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into the Bidens and the DNC server, which Trump wanted to exonerate Russia for its attack on the US election. Sondland also testified that he believed the aid was held up pending these investigations and that Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only about his own interests. He further stated that Zelensky only needed to announce the investigations, not actually carry them out. Sondland's testimony contradicted claims by Republicans that Ukraine meddled in US elections through public statements, as Trump wanted an inquiry into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the DNC. Sondland is not seen as a wholly reliable witness due to his denial of knowledge about the connection between Burisma and the Bidens.

END OF SUMMARY.
