SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland revealed that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on the country taking action on the public statement regarding investigations. He also testified about a call with Trump where the President expressed interest in investigations benefiting him, showing a disregard for Ukraine. Sondland's testimony clarifies Trump's intentions in calling for investigations into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, which involved Russia's attack on America. Republicans have attempted to massage Trump's claims of interference, but Sondland's statements indicate Trump's desire for Ukraine to help exonerate Russia for its attack. While Sondland may not be a wholly reliable witness, his testimony provides insight into Trump's attempts to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's involvement in his election. 

END OF SUMMARY.
