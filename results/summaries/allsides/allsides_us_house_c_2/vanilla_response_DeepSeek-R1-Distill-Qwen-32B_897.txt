Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about Sondland's testimony regarding the Ukraine aid and investigations. He mentioned that the resumption of U.S. aid was tied to Ukraine taking some action on a public statement about investigations. He told Pence that the aid was held up, and Pence nodded. Pence's staff denied that. Sondland didn't dispute Holmes' testimony where he overheard a call between Trump and Sondland. On that call, Trump asked if Ukraine would pursue investigations, and Sondland said they'd do whatever the president wanted. Sondland then said Trump didn't care about Ukraine, only the "big stuff" that benefits him. He also mentioned that Trump didn't care about the investigations themselves, just the public announcement. This would allow Trump to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Republicans tried to downplay Trump's claims, but Sondland clarified that Trump wanted an investigation into the DNC server, exonerating Russia. Sondland claimed he didn't know about Burisma and the Bidens, which seems unlikely. Republicans might focus on Sondland not hearing Trump directly link aid to investigations, but he inferred it.

So, the summary should cover Sondland's key points: tying aid to public statements, Trump's focus on announcements, the DNC server investigation, and the implications for Biden and Russia. Also mention Sondland's credibility issues and Republican reactions.

SUMMARY:  
Sondland testified that U.S. aid to Ukraine was conditioned on Ukraine making a public statement about investigations, specifically into the DNC server, to benefit Trump politically. He claimed Trump didn’t care about the investigations themselves, only their public announcement, which would help defame Biden and obscure Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Sondland also said Trump didn’t directly link aid to investigations but inferred it, and he dismissed claims about Burisma and the Bidens as implausible. Republicans may focus on Sondland’s claim that Trump never explicitly tied aid to investigations, despite his inference. END OF SUMMARY.
