SUMMARY:
Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took action on a public statement, which would benefit President Trump. Sondland told Vice President Pence that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and Pence nodded in agreement. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement of them, which would give him material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. Sondland's words exposed Trump's attempt to exonerate Russia for its attack on America. The testimony also showed that Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference are "insane" and that his demands for investigations were a "shakedown". END OF SUMMARY.
