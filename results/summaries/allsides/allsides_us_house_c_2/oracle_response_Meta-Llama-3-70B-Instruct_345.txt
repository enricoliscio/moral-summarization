SUMMARY:

Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigations, which would benefit President Trump. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement, which would allow him to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Trump wanted Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America, and Sondland's testimony revealed that he was willing to engage in a shakedown to get it. Republicans have tried to massage Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, but Sondland's testimony made it clear that Trump's goal was to get Ukraine to announce investigations into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC server. This is a clear case of meddling and interference, and Sondland's testimony has shed light on the true nature of Trump's actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
