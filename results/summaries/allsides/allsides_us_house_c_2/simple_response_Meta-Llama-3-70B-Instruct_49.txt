SUMMARY:

Gordon Sondland, the US Ambassador to the EU, testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not be resumed until Ukraine made a public statement about investigating the 2016 election interference. Sondland also testified that he believed the aid was being held up pending investigations, and that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, only the public announcement that would benefit him. This announcement would allow Trump to defame Joe Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony revealed that Trump's true intention was to get Ukraine to help exonerate Russia for its attack on America, and not to actually investigate Ukraine's role in the election. The moral framing of this testimony is clear: Trump's actions were self-serving and corrupt, and his administration's attempts to spin this as a legitimate investigation are dishonest and misleading. 

END OF SUMMARY.
