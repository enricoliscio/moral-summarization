SUMMARY:

Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified that he told a Ukrainian official that US aid would likely not resume until Ukraine made a public statement about investigating the 2016 election. He also testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence that the aid was being held up pending investigations, which Pence's chief of staff denied. Sondland confirmed a phone call with Trump, where Trump asked if Ukraine would pursue investigations, and Sondland replied that they would do whatever Trump wanted. Sondland testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but only about the public announcement of them, which would benefit Trump. The goal was to get Ukraine to announce investigations to defame Joe Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's role in the 2016 election. Sondland's testimony contradicted Republican claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, and instead showed that Trump wanted Ukraine to help exonerate Russia.
