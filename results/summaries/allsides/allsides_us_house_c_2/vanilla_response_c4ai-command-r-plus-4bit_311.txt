SUMMARY: In his testimony, Sondland said he communicated to a Ukrainian official that US aid was contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into Biden and the DNC server, which Trump wanted to exonerate Russia for its 2016 election interference. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about Ukraine but only about his own interests. He further supported the testimony of David Holmes, who overheard a call between Trump and Sondland where Trump inquired about investigations. Republicans tried to spin Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference, but Sondland's testimony made clear that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the DNC, not Russia. Sondland's credibility is questioned due to his denial of knowledge about Burisma and the Bidens, but he provided significant insights into Trump's motives and actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
