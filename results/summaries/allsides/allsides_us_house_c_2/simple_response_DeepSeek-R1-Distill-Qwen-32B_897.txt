Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Sondland's testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Let me break it down.

First, the user wants a summary that's under 200 words, so I need to be concise. The key points are Sondland's communication to Ukrainian officials about holding aid until investigations were announced, Trump's focus on public statements, and the implications for Biden and Russia.

I should highlight that Sondland linked aid to the public announcement, not the actual investigations. Trump's motive was to discredit Biden and exonerate Russia. Also, Sondland's credibility is questioned because he claimed ignorance about Burisma and the Bidens, which seems insincere.

The moral framing here is about Trump's misuse of power, putting personal interests over national security. I need to make sure that's clear in the summary. Also, mention that Republicans might focus on Sondland not hearing Trump directly link aid to investigations, but Sondland inferred it.

I should structure the summary to start with Sondland's role, then Trump's motives, the implications, and end with the credibility issue and Republican reactions. Keeping it under 200 words, so I'll have to be precise with each point.

SUMMARY:  
Sondland testified that he told Ukrainian officials U.S. aid would resume only if Ukraine made a public statement about pursuing investigations into the 2016 election, specifically targeting the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC. Trump, according to Sondland, cared only about the public announcement of these investigations, not their actual execution. This aligns with Trump's goal to defame Biden and exonerate Russia. Sondland also claimed Trump did not care about Ukraine itself, only the "big stuff" benefiting him. Republicans argue Sondland never directly heard Trump link aid to investigations, but Sondland inferred the connection. His credibility is questioned, as he claimed ignorance about Burisma's ties to the Bidens while pushing for investigations, likely to distance himself from Trump's scheme. Sondland's testimony underscores Trump's misuse of power for personal gain, prioritizing political advantage over national security.  
END OF SUMMARY.
