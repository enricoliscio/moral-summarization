SUMMARY:
Ambassador Sondland testified that he communicated to a Ukrainian official that the resumption of U.S. aid was contingent upon Ukraine taking action on a public statement, which was likely a precursor to investigations. Sondland also testified that Trump didn't care about the actual investigations, but rather the public announcement of them, which would give him material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia's help in getting Trump elected. This is a clear example of a "shakedown" where Trump is using his power to coerce Ukraine into doing his bidding. Sondland's testimony also revealed that Trump's claims of Ukrainian election interference are "insane" and that his goal was to get Ukraine's help in exonerating Russia for its attack on America. The Republicans' attempts to massage Trump's claims are a weak attempt to justify his "ugly" actions. END OF SUMMARY.
