SUMMARY: In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States has struggled with flawed foreign policy decisions, including the invasion of Iraq and a reactive swing toward disengagement and dithering. These errors have contributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics, damaged relations, and crises at home and abroad. President Obama has the opportunity to course-correct and bring about constructive change, but it requires the rare and vital ability to recognize and admit mistakes. A notable example of this is former President George W. Bush, who in his second term, acknowledged his shortcomings and instituted sweeping changes to his administration, policies, and priorities. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own personal struggles and failures earlier in life. By standing up to himself and demanding self-accountability, Bush brought about positive results in various regions and on social issues. Obama can learn from Bush's example and recognize the need for big changes in moments of foreign policy strain and dysfunction. By admitting mistakes and leading administration-wide change from within, Obama can break free from the blame game and bring about the necessary transformation.
