Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that since 9/11, U.S. foreign policy hasn't been a golden age. It mentions Bush's unilateral policies, especially the Iraq invasion, and then Obama's reactive approach leading to disengagement. It talks about the nation's problems due to a sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics. The author points out that some issues are fixable human errors and that the U.S. system can change.

The article then compares Obama to George W. Bush, noting that Bush made many mistakes but in his second term, he recognized the need for change. Bush made significant changes in his administration, like replacing key officials and changing policies, which led to better outcomes. The author contrasts this with Obama's aloofness from his cabinet, leading to strained relationships and a lack of constructive change.

The moral framing here is about leadership and the ability to admit mistakes and make changes. Bush's example is held up as a positive model for Obama, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection and reform in leadership.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the key points: the flawed U.S. foreign policy post-9/11, the comparison between Bush and Obama, and the moral lesson about leadership and admitting mistakes.

I'll start by stating the period hasn't been a golden age, mention Bush's Iraq mistake and Obama's disengagement. Then, note the problems from vulnerability and politics. Highlight that change is possible and the author's point about Bush's second-term changes. Compare this to Obama's leadership style and the moral takeaway about leadership and admitting errors.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going into too much detail.
