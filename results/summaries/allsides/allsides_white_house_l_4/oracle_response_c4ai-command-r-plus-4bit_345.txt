SUMMARY: Since the 9/11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed strategies and moral dilemmas. The Bush administration's unilateral excesses, including the invasion of Iraq, were followed by Obama's disengagement and dithering, resulting in crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa, as well as strained relations with allies due to NSA eavesdropping. However, Obama has an opportunity to learn from Bush's second term, where he recognized his mistakes, instituted a reordering of his administration, replaced key personnel, modified policies, and changed his engagement on issues like Iraq. Bush's ability to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own past failures and struggles. Obama, facing similar foreign policy challenges, should follow Bush's example and stand up to himself, admitting his mistakes and leading administration-wide change from within. This honest self-assessment and willingness to modify one's approach is a key aspect of effective leadership and moral growth.
END OF SUMMARY.
