Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand its main points.

The article is about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, comparing the approaches of Bush and Obama. It mentions that the period hasn't been a golden age, with Bush's Iraq invasion and Obama's disengagement as key mistakes. It also talks about how the U.S. has swung between policies and the impact on various regions like Syria, Iraq, Libya, etc.

The author points out that while Obama has made errors, he could learn from Bush's ability to admit mistakes and implement changes. Bush made significant changes in his second term, like replacing key staff and adopting new policies, which improved outcomes.

The user wants a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I need to capture the main ideas concisely. I'll highlight the flawed policies, the comparison between Bush and Obama, and the suggestion for Obama to learn from Bush's approach.

I should structure it to mention the period's challenges, Bush's initial mistakes, his later reforms, and how Obama could adopt similar strategies. Keeping it within the word limit is crucial, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise, and then check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions and a lack of constructive change, according to a recent analysis. The period has seen the Bush administration's unilateralism, exemplified by the Iraq invasion, followed by Obama's disengagement and indecision. Both leaders faced significant errors, including crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and strained relations with allies. Obama, however, has been criticized for failing to acknowledge mistakes and implement meaningful reforms. In contrast, George W. Bush, despite his many errors, recognized the need for change in his second term, replacing key officials and adopting new policies, such as the Iraq surge and a "light footprint" counterterrorism strategy. Bush's ability to admit mistakes and embrace change, influenced by his personal struggles, offers a model for Obama to emulate. The article suggests that Obama could benefit from learning from Bush's approach to leadership and reform, particularly in addressing foreign policy challenges and fostering collaboration within his administration.
