SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the US foreign policy since 9/11, criticizing the approaches of both the Bush and Obama administrations. The author argues that the US has swung between flawed policies, from unilateralism to disengagement, leading to damaged relations and crises in various regions. However, the author notes that the US system is built to change and that Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize and correct mistakes. Bush's second term saw a significant overhaul of his administration, policies, and priorities, leading to improved results in various areas. The author suggests that Obama could benefit from adopting a similar approach, acknowledging errors and embracing change, rather than being seen as aloof and reactive. By doing so, Obama can grow in office and produce constructive change.
