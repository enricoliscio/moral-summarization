SUMMARY:
Since 9/11, the US has swung from one set of flawed policies to another, from unilateralist excess to reactive disengagement. The nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and human errors that can be fixed. The US system is built to change, but it requires leaders who can recognize their mistakes and lead constructive change. Obama's errors in judgment and execution have contributed to damaged relations and crises worldwide. However, he can learn from George W. Bush, who recognized his mistakes and instituted sweeping changes in his second term. Bush's ability to admit errors and embrace change stemmed from his own failures and struggles. Obama would be wise to look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's example, standing up to himself and demanding change from within. END OF SUMMARY.
