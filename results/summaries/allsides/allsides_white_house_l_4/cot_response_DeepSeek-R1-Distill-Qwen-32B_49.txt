Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "unilateralist," "excess," "errors," "dysfunctional," "flaws," "crises," "strained," "admit," "change," "fix," "failures," "struggles," "shortcomings," "best," "wise," "content," "punt," "blame game," "big change," "needed," "demand," "admit," "lead," "change from within." I'll list these each with a star.

Next, I need to write a summary of the article. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by noting that the article discusses the U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, highlighting the flawed policies under Bush and Obama. It mentions the Iraq invasion as a key error and the reactive disengagement under Obama. The article points out the nation's vulnerabilities and dysfunctional politics. It then contrasts Obama's leadership with Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and make changes, like the Iraq surge. The summary should highlight that Bush's ability to recognize and fix errors led to better outcomes, suggesting Obama could learn from this approach.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes the key points without being too verbose. I'll make sure to incorporate the moral words to maintain the author's framing. Let me piece this together concisely, making sure not to exceed 200 words.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, highlighting flawed decisions under Bush and Obama, such as the Iraq invasion and reactive disengagement. It notes the nation's heightened vulnerability and dysfunctional politics, contributing to crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa, as well as strained relations with allies. The author contrasts Obama's aloof leadership with Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and implement sweeping changes, including a policy surge in Iraq. Bush's ability to acknowledge shortcomings and seek new perspectives improved outcomes, unlike Obama's White House-centric approach. The article suggests Obama could learn from Bush's example, emphasizing the need for leaders to admit errors and drive change. END OF SUMMARY.
