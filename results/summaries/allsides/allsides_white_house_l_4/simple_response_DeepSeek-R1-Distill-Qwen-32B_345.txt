Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. The article is about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, comparing Bush and Obama's approaches.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It starts by saying that the post-9/11 era isn't seen as a golden age for U.S. foreign policy. Bush's unilateral policies, especially the Iraq invasion, are criticized. Then Obama's disengagement and indecision are mentioned, with Iraq possibly symbolizing his errors too. The article talks about the U.S. being vulnerable and the impact of dysfunctional politics. It mentions that some problems can be fixed through human error correction.

The author then compares Obama to Bush, noting that Bush made many mistakes but recognized the need for change in his second term. Bush restructured his administration, changed policies, and brought in new people. The article highlights Bush's ability to admit mistakes and lead change, which improved outcomes in various areas. It contrasts this with Obama's aloofness from his cabinet and the lack of such change.

The key moral points are about leadership, admitting mistakes, and the importance of restructuring. The author suggests Obama could learn from Bush's approach.

Now, I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, keeping the moral framing. I should mention the flawed policies under both Bush and Obama, the need for change, Bush's example of admitting mistakes and restructuring, and the contrast with Obama's leadership style. I'll make sure to highlight the moral lessons about leadership and accountability.

I should structure it by first stating the overall assessment of the era, then Bush's mistakes and his corrective actions, followed by Obama's shortcomings, and the moral lesson about leadership and admitting errors.

Let me draft it, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The period since September 11, 2001, has been marked by flawed U.S. foreign policies, with the Iraq invasion under George W. Bush and disengagement under Barack Obama as notable errors. The U.S. has faced heightened vulnerability and political dysfunction, contributing to crises in regions like Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine, as well as strained relations with allies. While some issues stem from human error, the U.S. system allows for change. Bush, despite his mistakes, demonstrated leadership by admitting errors and restructuring his administration in his second term, leading to improved outcomes. In contrast, Obama's aloofness from his cabinet and reluctance to embrace change have hindered progress. The article highlights the moral importance of leaders admitting mistakes and driving change, urging Obama to learn from Bush's example. END OF SUMMARY.
