Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, comparing Bush and Obama's approaches. It mentions Bush's unilateral policies, especially the Iraq invasion, and Obama's disengagement. The author points out that both presidents made mistakes but suggests that Bush recognized his errors and made significant changes in his second term. Obama, on the other hand, is seen as aloof and not as effective in leadership. The key takeaway is that leaders need to admit mistakes and make changes, as Bush did, to improve foreign policy. I'll need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words.
