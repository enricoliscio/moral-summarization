SUMMARY: In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, US foreign policy has been characterized by a series of flawed approaches, from the Bush administration's unilateralism to Obama's disengagement and dithering. The article suggests that Obama can learn from Bush's ability to recognize mistakes and embrace change. Bush instituted a reordering of his administration, replacing key figures and modifying policies. He launched the surge in Iraq, initiated a "light footprint" approach to fighting terror, and responded to the financial crisis. Bush also actively sought outside perspectives for his second term, in contrast to Obama's insular approach. The author argues that Obama should stand up to himself, admit his mistakes, and lead administration-wide change from within, rather than giving up or punting to the future. Bush's willingness to acknowledge shortcomings and lead through tough times may have stemmed from his own personal failures and struggles. Obama would be wise to look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's ability to demand change and admit mistakes.
END OF SUMMARY.
