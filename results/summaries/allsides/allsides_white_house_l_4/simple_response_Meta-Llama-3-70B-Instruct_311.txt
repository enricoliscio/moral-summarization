SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the US foreign policy since 9/11, criticizing the unilateralist approach of the Bush administration and the reactive disengagement of the Obama administration. The author argues that the nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and human errors that can be fixed. Obama's mistakes have contributed to damaged relations and crises globally, but he can still produce constructive change by recognizing his errors. The author suggests that Obama can learn from George W. Bush, who, despite his mistakes, recognized the need for change in his second term and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change stemmed from his own life experiences and struggles. The article concludes that Obama would be wise to look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's example, standing up to himself and demanding administration-wide change from within.
