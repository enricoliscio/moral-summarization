SUMMARY:

The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed US foreign policies, swinging from unilateralist excess to disengagement and dithering. The invasion of Iraq, reactive swing, and eavesdropping scandals have contributed to damaged relations and crises worldwide. However, the US system is built to change, and leaders can correct their mistakes. President Obama, who has made errors of judgment and execution, can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize and correct his mistakes. In his second term, Bush instituted sweeping changes, replacing key officials, modifying policies, and launching new initiatives. He also actively sought outside perspectives and brought in new talent. Obama, on the other hand, is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, leading to feelings of being sidelined. To grow in office, Obama should look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's willingness to admit errors, stand up to himself, and lead administration-wide change. By doing so, he can begin to correct his mistakes and lead the country towards constructive change.
