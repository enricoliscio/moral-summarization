SUMMARY:
The years since the September 11 attacks have been marked by a series of unsettlingly flawed US foreign policies, swinging from unilateralist excess to reactive disengagement and dithering, with the invasion of Iraq and the war in Afghanistan as enduring symbols of these errors in judgment and execution. The heightened sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics of the nation have contributed to damaged relations and crises around the world, including at home. However, the genius of the US system is its ability to change and recognize mistakes. President Obama has the opportunity to learn from his predecessor, George W. Bush, who in his second term, admitted his shortcomings and instituted sweeping changes to his administration, policies, and priorities. Bush's willingness to embrace change and see his way through tough times may have stemmed from his own past failures and struggles. He actively sought outside perspectives and brought in new Cabinet secretaries who had not been part of his inner circle. Obama, currently seen as aloof from his Cabinet, could benefit from following Bush's example of standing up to himself and demanding that he admit his mistakes, thereby leading administration-wide change from within to address foreign policy dysfunctions and strains.
