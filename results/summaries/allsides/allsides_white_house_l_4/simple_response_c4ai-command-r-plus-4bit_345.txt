SUMMARY: Since the 9/11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed approaches and errors in judgment, swinging from unilateralism under the Bush administration to disengagement and dithering under Obama. The article argues that Obama can learn from his predecessor, George W. Bush, who recognized the need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration in his second term. Bush replaced key personnel, modified policies, and actively sought outside perspectives, leading to improved results in various regions and on social issues. This willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from Bush's own past failures and struggles, and he turned it into a strength, acting as a "coach-in-chief" to support and encourage his Cabinet members. Obama, by contrast, is seen as aloof from his Cabinet and has allowed dysfunctional politics to get in the way of national interests. If he is to improve his foreign policy legacy, Obama would be wise to learn from Bush's example and admit his own mistakes, leading administration-wide change from within. END OF SUMMARY.
