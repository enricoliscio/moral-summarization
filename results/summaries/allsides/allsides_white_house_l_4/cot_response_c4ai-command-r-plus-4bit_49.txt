SUMMARY:
The years following the September 11 attacks have been marked by a series of flawed U.S. foreign policies and a heightened sense of vulnerability. The article argues that while some of these issues are understandable given the context, others are the result of human errors that can and should be fixed. The key to constructive change, it suggests, lies in the ability of leaders to admit their mistakes and embrace change. The article uses the example of George W. Bush, who, despite his many mistakes, recognized the need for change and overhauled his administration, policies, and priorities during his second term. Bush brought in fresh perspectives and modified his approach to key issues like Iraq, with positive results in many regions. The article contrasts Bush's willingness to admit errors and adapt with Obama's more aloof and White House-centric approach, which has contributed to damaged relations and crises. It encourages Obama to look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's ability to stand up to himself and demand administration-wide change from within. By admitting mistakes and leading change, Obama can begin to address the moral strains and dysfunctions in U.S. foreign policy and avoid playing the blame game.
