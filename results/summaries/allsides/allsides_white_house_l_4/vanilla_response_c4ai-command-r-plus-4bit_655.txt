SUMMARY: In the years following the September 11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed decisions and reactive swings, from the invasion of Iraq under the Bush administration to Obama's disengagement and dithering. However, despite their mistakes, both presidents had the ability to recognize their errors and make changes. Bush's second term saw a sweeping reordering of policies and personnel, resulting in improved relations and outcomes. Obama, facing similar foreign policy challenges, can learn from Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and lead administration-wide change. Bush's ability to acknowledge shortcomings and adapt may have stemmed from his own personal struggles, and he also served as a coach-in-chief, supporting and encouraging his Cabinet members. Obama is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, but he has the opportunity to grow and lead constructive change by following Bush's example of self-reflection and adaptation.
END OF SUMMARY.
