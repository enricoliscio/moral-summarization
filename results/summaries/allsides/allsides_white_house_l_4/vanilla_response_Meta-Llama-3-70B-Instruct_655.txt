SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the US foreign policy since 9/11, describing it as a series of flawed policies. The author criticizes the Bush administration's unilateralism and Obama's reactive disengagement. The nation's problems are attributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability and human errors that can be fixed. The article suggests that Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize mistakes and institute change. Bush's second term saw a sweeping reordering of his administration, policies, and priorities, including replacing key officials and modifying his engagement on key issues. The results were improved in various regions, including social issues, relations with allies, and war zones. The article concludes that Obama can grow in office by learning from Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change, rather than being aloof from his Cabinet and playing the blame game.
