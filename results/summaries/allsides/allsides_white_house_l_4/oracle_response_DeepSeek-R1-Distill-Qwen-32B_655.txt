Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that must be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It discusses the U.S. foreign policy post-9/11, highlighting errors under Bush and Obama. The author suggests Obama should learn from Bush's approach of admitting mistakes and making changes. 

I need to identify the key moral terms used: invasion, disengagement, dithering, eavesdropping, mistakes, instituted, reordering, replaced, modified, changed, launching, initiating, fighting, terror, sidelines, strains, dysfunctions, punt, play, stand, lead. I'll ensure these words are included in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it by first outlining the flawed policies under Bush and Obama, then Bush's corrective actions, and finally the advice for Obama to follow suit. I'll make sure each moral term is naturally integrated without forcing them in.

I'll start by stating the period's challenges, mention Bush's invasion of Iraq and Obama's disengagement. Then, I'll note the issues like strained relations and NSA eavesdropping. Next, I'll highlight Bush's changes, such as replacing staff and policies, leading to better outcomes. Finally, I'll conclude with the advice for Obama to admit mistakes and lead change, using the required terms.

SUMMARY: Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions, from Bush's invasion of Iraq to Obama's disengagement and dithering. The nation has faced crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa, as well as strained relations with allies over NSA eavesdropping. While Obama has inherited a legacy of mistakes, he is not doomed to repeat them. The author suggests learning from Bush, who, despite his errors, admitted mistakes and reorganized his administration, replacing key officials and modifying policies. Bush's actions included launching the Iraq surge and adopting a "light footprint" approach to fighting terror, leading to improved outcomes. In contrast, Obama's Cabinet feels sidelined, and his White House-centric approach has hindered constructive change. The author urges Obama to embrace change by admitting mistakes and leading from within, as Bush did, rather than giving up, punting to the future, or playing the blame game. The ability to stand up to oneself and demand accountability is crucial for addressing the strains and dysfunctions in U.S. foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
