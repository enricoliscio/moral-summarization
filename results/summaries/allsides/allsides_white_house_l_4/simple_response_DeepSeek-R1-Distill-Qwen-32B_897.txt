Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main arguments. It's about U.S. foreign policy post-9/11, criticizing both Bush and Obama administrations. The author suggests that Obama needs to learn from Bush's ability to admit mistakes and make changes.

I should highlight the flaws in both administrations: Bush's unilateralism leading to Iraq, and Obama's disengagement. The moral aspect is about leadership and accountability. Bush changed his policies after recognizing errors, which had positive effects. Obama, on the other hand, is seen as distant and not open to change.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the critique of both presidents, the need for Obama to admit mistakes, and the example of Bush's leadership qualities.

Also, the summary should end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start with "SUMMARY:". I'll make sure it's concise and captures the moral lesson the author is conveying.

Let me structure it: Start with the period since 9/11, mention both Bush and Obama's issues, then Bush's turnaround, and the advice to Obama to learn from that. Keep it balanced and highlight the moral framing about leadership and change.

SUMMARY: Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions, from Bush's Iraq invasion to Obama's disengagement. The nation's vulnerabilities and political dysfunction have exacerbated crises in regions like Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine, as well as strained relations with allies. Obama, while not doomed to repeat errors, lacks the ability to acknowledge mistakes, unlike Bush, who, after recognizing his failures, restructured his administration and implemented significant changes, such as the Iraq surge and financial crisis response. Bush's willingness to admit errors and seek new perspectives contrasts with Obama's aloof leadership style. The author suggests Obama could learn from Bush's example, emphasizing the importance of humility, accountability, and the courage to lead change. END OF SUMMARY.
