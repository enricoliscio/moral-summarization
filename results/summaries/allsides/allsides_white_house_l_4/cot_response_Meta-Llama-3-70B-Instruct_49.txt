SUMMARY:
Since 9/11, the US has swung from one set of flawed policies to another, with the Bush administration's unilateralist excess and Obama's reactive disengagement. The nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and human errors that can be fixed. Obama's errors in judgment and execution have contributed to damaged relations and crises globally. However, he can still produce constructive change by recognizing his mistakes, a rare and vital quality in a leader. He can learn from George W. Bush, who admitted his errors and instituted sweeping changes in his second term, leading to better results in various regions. Obama needs to emulate Bush's willingness to acknowledge shortcomings and fix them, rather than being aloof and sidelined. By doing so, he can grow in office and lead administration-wide change.
