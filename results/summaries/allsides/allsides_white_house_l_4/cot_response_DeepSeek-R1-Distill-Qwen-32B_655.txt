Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "golden age," "unilateralist excess," "errors," "flawed policies," "disengagement," "dithering," "vulnerability," "frayed," "dysfunctional," "crises," "strained," "errors of judgment," "mistakes," "genius," "change," "constructive," "rare," "vital," "model," "best example," "many," "urgent need," "reordering," "weekly conference calls," "surge," "light footprint," "fighting AIDS," "deals," "outside perspectives," "aloof," "strikingly different," "crisis," "doubt," "bucked up," "confidence," "best person," "backed," "White House-centric," "sidelined," "dismiss," "errors," "foreign policy strains," "dysfunctions," "content," "punt," "blame game," "big change," "stand up," "admit," "lead," "administration-wide change," "within."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, highlighting the moral aspects. The article compares Obama's foreign policy to Bush's, noting the flaws and suggesting that Obama could learn from Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and make changes. I'll focus on the key points: the flawed policies post-9/11, Bush's recognition and changes, Obama's aloofness, and the suggestion for Obama to adopt a similar approach.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose. I'll structure it to first outline the problems, then Bush's response, contrast with Obama, and conclude with the recommendation.

**SUMMARY:**

The article critiques U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, highlighting flawed decisions and crises under both Bush and Obama. Bush's Iraq invasion and Obama's disengagement are labeled errors, while the nation's dysfunction and vulnerability have strained relations. Bush, despite many mistakes, acknowledged failures and restructured his administration, leading to improved outcomes. Obama, in contrast, is seen as aloof and resistant to change. The article suggests Obama could learn from Bush's ability to admit mistakes and embrace reform, emphasizing the importance of leadership and accountability in addressing foreign policy challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
