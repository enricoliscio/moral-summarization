SUMMARY: In the years following the September 11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed strategies and reactive approaches, with the Bush administration's unilateralism and invasion of Iraq followed by Obama's disengagement and similar mistakes in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and beyond. However, the article suggests that Obama can learn from Bush's second term, where he acknowledged his mistakes and made sweeping changes to his administration and policies. Bush replaced key personnel, modified policies in Iraq, responded to the financial crisis, and sought outside perspectives for his second-term team. The author argues that Obama can learn from Bush's ability to recognize and admit mistakes, lead administration-wide change, and grow as a leader in challenging times. Bush's willingness to admit errors may have stemmed from his own struggles and failures earlier in life, which taught him the importance of acknowledging shortcomings and taking corrective action. Obama can benefit from this approach as he navigates foreign policy challenges and seeks to improve his leadership.
END OF SUMMARY.
