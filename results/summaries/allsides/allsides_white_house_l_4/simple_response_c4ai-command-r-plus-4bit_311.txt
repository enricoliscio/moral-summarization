SUMMARY: In the years following the September 11 attacks, US foreign policy has been characterized by a series of flawed and often unilateral approaches, with the invasion of Iraq and subsequent disengagement under Barack Obama being notable errors. However, there is a way forward: learning from the example set by George W. Bush, who in his second term acknowledged his mistakes and implemented sweeping changes to his administration and policies. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own personal failures and struggles, and he actively sought to bring in outside perspectives, modify his approach to key issues, and modify his leadership style. This ability to recognize mistakes and lead administration-wide change is a rare and vital quality in a leader, and one that Obama would be wise to emulate if he hopes to bring about constructive change and improve damaged relations. By standing up to himself and demanding self-accountability, a leader can initiate the big changes needed to correct course.
