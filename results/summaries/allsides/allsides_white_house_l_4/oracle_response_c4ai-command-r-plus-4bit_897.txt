SUMMARY: In the years following the 9/11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed and unsettling approaches, swinging from the unilateral excesses of the Bush administration's first term to the disengagement and dithering of the Obama era. Obama finds himself facing a string of mistakes that have led to damaged relations and crises around the world, from Syria and Iraq to Libya and Egypt. However, there is a way forward. Obama can draw inspiration from his predecessor, George W. Bush, who in his second term recognized the need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration. Bush replaced key cabinet members, modified policies, and changed his own engagement on issues like Iraq. He stood up to himself and demanded that he admit his mistakes, leading to improved results in region after region. Obama would be wise to learn from Bush's ability to recognize mistakes and embrace change, which may have stemmed from Bush's own failures and struggles earlier in life. This could help Obama grow as a leader and begin to repair the strains and dysfunctions in US foreign policy.
