Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure I adhere to that. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Let me read through the article again to spot those words.

The article starts by talking about the period since 9/11 not being a golden age of US foreign policy. Words like "golden age" have a positive moral connotation. Then it mentions "flawed policies," which is a negative moral term. "Unilateralist excess" is another negative term, indicating excessive and wrong actions. The invasion of Iraq is labeled as a "signature error," so "error" is a moral word here.

Moving on, the article talks about Obama's "disengagement and dithering," which are negative. It also mentions "heightened sense of vulnerability," which is more of a state but could imply a moral failing in handling it. "Frayed and on edge" describes a negative state. "Dysfunctional politics" is a strong negative moral term. "Human errors" are mistakes, so that's negative. "Genius of the US system" is positive, highlighting a strength.

The article then discusses Obama needing "constructive change" and the "ability to recognize mistakes," which are positive moral actions. It contrasts this with Bush, who made "many" mistakes but later changed his administration, showing a positive moral action. Words like "sweeping reordering," "weekly conference calls," "surge in Iraq," "light footprint," and "fighting AIDS in Africa" are positive outcomes. "Strained relations" is negative. Bush's "outside perspectives" and "new military commanders" are positive changes.

Bush's willingness to "admit errors" and "embrace change" are positive. His "failures and struggles" in life are negative but led to positive actions. "Coach-in-chief" is a positive role. Obama is "aloof," which is negative, while Bush's Cabinet members felt supported, a positive. The article ends by suggesting Obama should learn from Bush's ability to change, which is a positive moral lesson.

Now, I'll list all these morally framed words as per the user's instruction. Then, I need to write a concise summary, keeping these words to preserve the moral framing. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be brief but include the key points about the flawed policies, the need for change, Bush's example, and Obama's current approach. I should make sure to include the moral terms identified to maintain the original framing.

It argues that the nation's dysfunction and vulnerability have hindered national interests, but change is possible. The author suggests Obama should learn from George W. Bush, who, despite many errors, acknowledged his mistakes and reorganized his administration, leading to better outcomes in Iraq and elsewhere. Bush's ability to admit failures and embrace change, drawing from his personal struggles, stands as a model. In contrast, Obama's aloofness and White House-centric approach have sidelined his Cabinet. The article concludes that Obama could benefit from Bush's example, emphasizing the need for leaders to recognize errors and lead constructive change.
