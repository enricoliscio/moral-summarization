SUMMARY:

The period since 9/11 has been marked by flawed US foreign policies, swinging from unilateralist excess to disengagement and dithering. The invasion of Iraq was a signature error, and the reactive swing under Obama has led to crises in Syria, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa. The nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability, dysfunctional politics, and human errors that can be fixed. However, Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize mistakes and institute change. Bush's second term saw a sweeping reordering of his administration, policies, and priorities, including replacing key officials and modifying his engagement on key issues. He launched the surge in Iraq, initiated a "light footprint" approach to fighting terror, and responded to the financial crisis. Obama would do well to emulate Bush's willingness to admit errors and lead administration-wide change from within, rather than being aloof from his Cabinet and playing the blame game. By doing so, he can begin to grow in office and address the strains and dysfunctions in US foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
