SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the US foreign policy since 9/11, describing it as a series of flawed policies. The author argues that the country has swung from unilateralism under Bush to disengagement under Obama, leading to crises in various regions. However, the author suggests that Obama can learn from Bush's ability to recognize and correct mistakes. During his second term, Bush made significant changes to his administration, policies, and priorities, including replacing key officials and modifying his engagement on key issues. This led to improved results in various regions and on social issues. The article concludes that Obama can benefit from Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change, and that this ability is essential for a leader to grow in office.
