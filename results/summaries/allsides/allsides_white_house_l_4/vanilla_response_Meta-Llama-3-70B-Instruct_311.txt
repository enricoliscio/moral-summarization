SUMMARY:

The article discusses the flaws in US foreign policy since 9/11, citing the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration and the reactive disengagement of the Obama administration. The author argues that the US has swung from one flawed policy to another, contributing to damaged relations and crises in various regions. However, the author suggests that Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize and correct mistakes. Bush's second term saw a sweeping reordering of his administration, policies, and priorities, including replacing key officials and modifying his own engagement on key issues. The author notes that Obama's approach has been criticized for being aloof from his Cabinet, whereas Bush was known for his ability to coach and support his team. The article concludes that Obama can benefit from Bush's willingness to admit errors and lead change from within.
