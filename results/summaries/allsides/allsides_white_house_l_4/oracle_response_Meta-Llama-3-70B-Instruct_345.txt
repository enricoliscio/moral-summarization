SUMMARY:

The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed policies, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq to Barack Obama's reactive swing towards disengagement and dithering. The nation's problems are partly due to a heightened sense of vulnerability, but also to human errors that can be fixed. Obama's errors in judgment and execution have contributed to damaged relations and crises in various regions. However, he can still produce constructive change by recognizing his mistakes, a quality rare in leaders. A model for Obama could be George W. Bush, who in his second term recognized the need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration, replacing key officials and modifying policies. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change stemmed from his own life struggles and failures. Obama, on the other hand, is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, and would benefit from adopting a more inclusive approach. By standing up to himself and demanding change, Obama can lead administration-wide reform and produce better results. END OF SUMMARY.
