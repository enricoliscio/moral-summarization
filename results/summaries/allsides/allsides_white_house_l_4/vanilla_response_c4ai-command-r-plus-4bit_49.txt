SUMMARY: In the years following the September 11 attacks, U.S. foreign policy has been characterized by a series of flawed approaches, swinging from the unilateralism of the Bush administration's first term to the disengagement and indecisiveness of the Obama administration. However, despite his own share of mistakes, George W. Bush recognized the need for change during his second term and implemented sweeping personnel and policy changes that led to improvements in various areas. Bush's ability to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own personal struggles and failures earlier in life. This self-awareness also translated into his role as a supportive coach-in-chief to his cabinet members, in contrast to Obama's more distant approach. As Obama faces similar foreign policy challenges, he would benefit from following Bush's example of acknowledging mistakes and leading administration-wide change from within.
