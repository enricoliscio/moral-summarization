SUMMARY:
Since 9/11, the US has swung from one set of flawed policies to another, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration to the reactive disengagement of Obama's presidency. The nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and human errors that can be fixed. However, Obama's errors of judgment and execution have contributed to damaged relations and crises around the world. To produce constructive change, Obama needs to recognize his mistakes and lead administration-wide change from within, like George W. Bush did in his second term. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change led to better results in various regions and issues. Obama would be wise to learn from Bush's example and stand up to himself to demand change.
