SUMMARY:
The period following the September 11 attacks has been marked by a series of flawed U.S. foreign policy decisions, swinging from the unilateral excesses of the Bush administration to the disengagement and dithering of the Obama presidency. The article argues that while some of the nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics, others are a result of human errors that can be rectified. The key to constructive change, it suggests, lies in the ability to recognize and admit mistakes, a quality exemplified by George W. Bush in his second term. Bush overhauled his administration, replaced key personnel, and modified policies, resulting in improved outcomes in various regions and on social issues. He also actively sought outside perspectives, in contrast to the insular Obama approach. The article encourages Obama to learn from Bush's ability to lead administration-wide change by demanding self-accountability and admitting his own mistakes. It concludes that by doing so, Obama can move beyond blame and bring about the big change that the American system sometimes requires.
