SUMMARY:
The article reflects on the foreign policy decisions made by the United States since the September 11, 2001 attacks, describing a history "not pretty." It argues that the US has swung from one set of flawed policies to another, with the invasion of Iraq and the reactive disengagement of Barack Obama being signature errors. The author acknowledges that some of the nation's problems stem from a heightened sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics, but also highlights human *errors* that can be fixed. The article praises the ability of the US system to bring about *change*, and encourages President Obama to recognize and learn from his *mistakes*. It suggests that Obama could look to George W. Bush as a model for admitting *errors* and embracing *change*, noting that Bush made significant modifications to his administration and policies in his second term. The article also highlights Bush's ability to support and motivate his Cabinet members, contrasting it with Obama's more White House-centric approach. It encourages Obama to look beyond political caricatures and recognize the importance of admitting *mistakes* and leading *change* from within.
