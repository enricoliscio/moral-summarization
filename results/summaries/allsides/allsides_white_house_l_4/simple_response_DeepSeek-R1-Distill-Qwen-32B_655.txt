Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 and compares Obama's approach to Bush's. The author is critical of both but seems to highlight Bush's ability to admit mistakes and change course as a positive example for Obama. 

First, I should identify the main points: the period since 9/11 has been problematic for U.S. foreign policy, with Bush's unilateralism and Iraq invasion, followed by Obama's disengagement. The author points out that both presidents made errors, but Bush took steps to correct them by changing his administration and policies, leading to some improvements. The article suggests Obama should learn from Bush's ability to recognize and fix mistakes.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, which is about leadership and accountability. The author is highlighting the importance of a leader admitting errors and making necessary changes, using Bush as a model for Obama. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key elements: the flawed policies, Bush's corrective actions, and the lesson for Obama.

I should avoid getting bogged down in the details of each policy but focus on the overarching theme of leadership and change. Also, the summary should end with the conclusion that Obama can learn from Bush's example.

Let me structure this: start with the period's issues, mention Bush's and Obama's mistakes, then Bush's corrective actions, and finally the advice for Obama to admit errors and lead change. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Since the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions, from Bush's Iraq invasion to Obama's disengagement. The author critiques both presidents for errors but highlights Bush's ability to admit mistakes and implement significant changes, such as restructuring his administration and adopting new policies. This contrasts with Obama's perceived aloofness and reluctance to embrace change. The article suggests Obama could learn from Bush's leadership, emphasizing the importance of admitting faults and driving internal reforms to address ongoing foreign policy challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
