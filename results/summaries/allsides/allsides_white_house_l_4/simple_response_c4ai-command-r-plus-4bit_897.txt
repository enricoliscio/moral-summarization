SUMMARY: Since the September 11 attacks, US foreign policy has been characterized by a series of flawed approaches, swinging from the unilateralism of the Bush administration's first term to the disengagement and dithering of the Obama administration. However, despite his mistakes, George W. Bush recognized the need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration, policies, and priorities in his second term. Bush replaced key personnel, modified policies, and actively sought outside perspectives, leading to improved results in various regions and on social issues. Obama, facing similar foreign policy challenges, would be wise to learn from Bush's ability to admit mistakes and lead administration-wide change. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own failures and struggles earlier in life, and he turned this into a strength by becoming a coach-in-chief who supported and encouraged his Cabinet members. Obama, on the other hand, is perceived as aloof from his Cabinet. If he wants to grow as a leader, he should look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's ability to demand change and admit mistakes.
END OF SUMMARY.
