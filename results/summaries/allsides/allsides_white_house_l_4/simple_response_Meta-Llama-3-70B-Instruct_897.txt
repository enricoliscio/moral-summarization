SUMMARY:

The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed US foreign policies, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration to the reactive disengagement of the Obama administration. The nation's problems are partly due to a heightened sense of vulnerability, but also due to human errors that can be fixed. The author argues that Obama's mistakes can be rectified if he learns from his predecessor, George W. Bush, who recognized his errors and instituted sweeping changes in his second term. Bush's ability to admit mistakes and embrace change stemmed from his own life experiences and struggles. He brought in new perspectives, rewrote key policies, and actively sought to bring in outside experts. In contrast, Obama is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, and his White House-centric approach has left Cabinet officers feeling sidelined. The author urges Obama to learn from Bush's example and take responsibility for his mistakes, leading administration-wide change from within.
