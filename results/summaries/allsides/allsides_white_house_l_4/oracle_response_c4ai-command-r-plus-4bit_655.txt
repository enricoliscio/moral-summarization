SUMMARY: Since the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed strategies and mistakes, swinging from the unilateral excesses of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq to Obama's reactive disengagement and dithering. Obama finds himself facing a string of errors that have damaged relations and created crises globally, from Syria and Iraq to Libya and Egypt. However, there is hope for constructive change if Obama can recognize and admit his mistakes, a quality exemplified by his predecessor, George W. Bush. Bush's second term was marked by a sweeping reordering of his administration, with replaced cabinet members and modified policies. Bush admitted his errors and embraced change, perhaps due to his own past failures and struggles. He actively sought outside perspectives and instituted policies like the surge in Iraq and the "light footprint" approach to fighting terror. Obama, in contrast, is seen as aloof and has sidelined his Cabinet, playing the blame game instead of standing up to admit mistakes and lead administration-wide change. If Obama can learn from Bush's ability to demand change and recognize mistakes, there is a chance for growth and improved foreign policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
