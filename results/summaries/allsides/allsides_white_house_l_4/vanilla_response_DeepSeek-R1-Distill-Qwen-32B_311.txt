Alright, I need to summarize this article about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11. The user wants it to be concise, under 200 words, and structured with a "SUMMARY:" token at the start and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It starts by stating that the period after 9/11 isn't a golden age for U.S. foreign policy. The author, who wrote a history on this, mentions the flawed policies under Bush and Obama. Bush's main error was the Iraq invasion, while Obama's issues include disengagement and dithering, leading to problems in various regions like Syria, Libya, and others.

The article then contrasts Obama's leadership style with Bush's. Bush, despite many mistakes, recognized errors and made significant changes in his second term, like reshuffling his cabinet and adopting new policies. This led to some improvements, such as the Iraq surge and better relations with allies. The author suggests Obama could learn from Bush's ability to admit mistakes and implement changes.

I need to capture these key points: the flawed policies post-9/11, Bush's mistakes, Obama's issues, the contrast in leadership styles, and the suggestion for Obama to learn from Bush's approach.

I should structure the summary to first mention the overall assessment of U.S. foreign policy, then discuss Bush and Obama's mistakes, followed by the contrast in their leadership, and conclude with the advice for Obama.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is concise. I'll start with the period since 9/11, mention Bush's Iraq invasion, Obama's disengagement, the problems that arose, and then highlight Bush's corrective actions. Finally, I'll note the author's suggestion for Obama to adopt a similar approach.

Let me draft this, making sure to include all key elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The period since September 11, 2001, has not been a golden age for U.S. foreign policy, marked by flawed decisions and heightened vulnerability. The Bush administration's unilateralism, including the Iraq invasion, was followed by Obama's disengagement, leading to crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere. The U.S. has struggled with strained relations, border issues, and NSA controversies. While Obama faces criticism, the article suggests he could learn from Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and implement sweeping changes in his second term. Bush reshuffled his cabinet, adopted new policies like the Iraq surge, and sought outside perspectives, leading to improved outcomes. In contrast, Obama's aloof leadership has left Cabinet members sidelined. The author advises Obama to embrace change and admit errors, as Bush did, to address foreign policy challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
