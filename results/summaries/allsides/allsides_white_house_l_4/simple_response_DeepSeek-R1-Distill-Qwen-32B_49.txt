Alright, so I'm trying to summarize this news article for the user. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that since 9/11, U.S. foreign policy hasn't been a golden age. The author, who wrote a history on this period, points out that the U.S. has swung between flawed policies. First, under Bush, there was the Iraq invasion, which was a big mistake. Then under Obama, there was disengagement and indecision, leading to issues like the war in Syria. The author mentions that the U.S. has been vulnerable and politically dysfunctional, affecting national interests.

The article then talks about Obama being at the end of a series of policy errors, leading to various crises around the world and strained relations with allies. However, the author suggests that Obama isn't doomed to continue making mistakes. The key is for him to recognize his errors, similar to how Bush did in his second term. Bush made many mistakes but recognized the need for change, restructured his administration, and implemented new policies, leading to some successes.

The author contrasts Obama's leadership style with Bush's. Bush was more hands-on, supportive of his team, and brought in outsiders, which helped improve the situation. Obama, on the other hand, is seen as aloof, leading to Cabinet members feeling sidelined. The article suggests that Obama could learn from Bush's approach by admitting mistakes and embracing change.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. The article criticizes both Bush and Obama but ultimately suggests that leadership and admitting mistakes can lead to improvement. It's about accountability and the ability to change course, which are moral qualities.

I should structure the summary to highlight the period's challenges, the errors of both Bush and Obama, and the lesson that recognizing mistakes can lead to better outcomes. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all key points.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the main elements: the flawed policies post-9/11, the comparison between Bush and Obama, the need for leaders to admit mistakes, and the positive outcome when they do. I'll end with the moral takeaway about accountability and change.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me count the words in my draft. It looks like it's around 190 words, so that's good. I think this captures the essence and the moral framing the user is looking for.

SUMMARY: Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions and a heightened sense of vulnerability, according to a recent analysis. The Bush administration's unilateralism, including the Iraq invasion, was followed by Obama's disengagement, leading to crises in Syria, Libya, and elsewhere. Dysfunction in politics and errors in judgment have strained relations with allies and exacerbated global conflicts. However, the article suggests that Obama, like Bush in his second term, could address these issues by acknowledging mistakes and embracing change. Bush, despite his errors, restructured his administration, implemented new policies, and improved outcomes in areas like Iraq and international relations. In contrast, Obama's aloof leadership style has left Cabinet members sidelined. The article highlights the importance of leaders admitting faults and taking accountability to drive constructive change, emphasizing that big transformations require self-reflection and bold action. END OF SUMMARY.
