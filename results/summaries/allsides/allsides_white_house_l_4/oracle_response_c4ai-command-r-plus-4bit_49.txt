SUMMARY: Since the 9/11 attacks, US foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed strategies and mistakes, from the Bush administration's unilateral excesses to Obama's disengagement and dithering. Obama now faces a string of errors that have damaged relations and created crises globally. However, he can learn from Bush's second term, where he recognized his mistakes, instituted a reordering, and replaced key personnel. Bush modified his approach, changed policies, and actively sought outside perspectives, resulting in improved outcomes. He also demonstrated an ability to admit errors and embrace change, possibly stemming from his own past failures. Bush's willingness to stand up to himself and demand self-accountability is a vital lesson for Obama if he wants to lead effective change and navigate current strains and dysfunctions. Bush's ability to coach and support his Cabinet, in contrast to Obama's White House-centric approach, is also notable. Obama can learn from Bush's example of recognizing mistakes and leading administration-wide change from within.
END OF SUMMARY.
