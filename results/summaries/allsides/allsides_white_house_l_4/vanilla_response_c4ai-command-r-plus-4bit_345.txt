SUMMARY: The article reflects on the foreign policy decisions made by the United States since the 9/11 attacks, arguing that the country has swung from one set of flawed policies to another. The Bush administration's unilateralist excesses in the first term, including the invasion of Iraq, are contrasted with Barack Obama's reactive disengagement and dithering, resulting in crises in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa, as well as strained relations with allies. The article suggests that Obama could learn from Bush's ability to recognize mistakes and embrace change, highlighting Bush's second-term reordering of his administration and policies, which led to improved results in various regions. Bush's willingness to admit errors may have stemmed from his own personal struggles and failures, and he turned this into a strength, acting as a coach-in-chief to support and encourage his Cabinet members. The article concludes by suggesting that Obama should look beyond political caricatures and learn from Bush's ability to lead administration-wide change by admitting mistakes and demanding better.
