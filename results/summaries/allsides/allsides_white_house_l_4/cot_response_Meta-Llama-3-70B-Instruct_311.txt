SUMMARY:
The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed policies and errors in U.S. foreign policy. The Bush administration's unilateralist excess, including the invasion of Iraq, was followed by Obama's reactive swing towards disengagement and dithering. The result has been a string of crises and damaged relations with allies. However, the article argues that Obama can still produce constructive change by recognizing his mistakes and instituting a sweeping reordering of his administration. The author points to George W. Bush as a model, who in his second term recognized the need for change and made significant reforms, including replacing key officials and modifying his approach to key issues. By acknowledging his shortcomings and embracing change, Bush was able to turn his failures into a plus. Obama would be wise to learn from Bush's example and lead administration-wide change from within. END OF SUMMARY.
