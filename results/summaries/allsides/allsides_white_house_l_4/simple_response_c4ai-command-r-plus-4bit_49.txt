SUMMARY: The period following the September 11 attacks has been marked by a series of flawed foreign policies and errors in judgment by the US, including the invasion of Iraq and reactive disengagement under Barack Obama. Obama now faces a string of crises and damaged relations, both domestically and internationally. However, there is a way forward: recognizing and admitting mistakes, and implementing constructive change. This was achieved by George W. Bush in his second term, where he instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration and policies, leading to improved results in various regions and relations with allies. Bush's ability to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own personal failures and struggles, and he turned this into a strength, acting as a "coach-in-chief" to support and encourage his Cabinet members. Obama, who is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, could learn from Bush's example and stand up to himself and his administration, demanding admission of mistakes and leading change from within. There is hope for improvement, but it requires a moral courage and honesty that begins with the President himself.
END OF SUMMARY.
