Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user provided the article, and I have to make sure the summary is under 200 words and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, discussing how it's been flawed under both Bush and Obama. The author, who wrote a history on this period, points out the mistakes each administration made. Bush's Iraq invasion was a big error, and Obama's approach led to other issues like strained relations with allies and problems in various regions.

The article also talks about how Bush, in his second term, recognized his mistakes and made significant changes, like reshuffling his cabinet and implementing new policies. This led to some improvements. In contrast, Obama didn't do as much to fix the problems, and his administration was seen as aloof from their cabinet.

The key takeaway is that leaders need to acknowledge their mistakes and make changes, as Bush did, to improve their policies. The author suggests Obama could learn from Bush's approach despite their differences.

Now, I'll condense this into a concise summary. I need to mention the flawed policies under both presidents, Bush's recognition and changes, and the contrast with Obama's approach. Also, the importance of admitting mistakes for constructive change.

I should keep it around 200 words, making sure it's clear and captures all main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the period, mention Bush and Obama's issues, Bush's corrective actions, Obama's shortcomings, and the lesson about admitting mistakes.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the U.S. foreign policy since September 11, 2001, describing it as a period marked by flawed decisions and crises. The Bush administration's unilateralist approach, highlighted by the Iraq invasion, was followed by Obama's reactive policies, leading to disengagement and regional instability. The article critiques the U.S. system's vulnerabilities, including dysfunctional politics and human errors, but notes its ability to change. Bush, despite his mistakes, recognized the need for reform in his second term, reshuffling his cabinet and implementing policies like the Iraq surge, which improved outcomes. In contrast, Obama's administration was seen as aloof, with strained relations with allies and a lack of leadership in addressing crises. The article suggests that Obama could learn from Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change, emphasizing the importance of leaders acknowledging mistakes to drive constructive change. END OF SUMMARY.
