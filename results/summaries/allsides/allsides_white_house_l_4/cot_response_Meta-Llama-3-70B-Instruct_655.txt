SUMMARY:
The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed policies, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration to the reactive disengagement of the Obama administration. The invasion of Iraq, a tragic irony, has contributed to a sense of vulnerability and dysfunction in US politics. The nation's problems are compounded by human errors, including mistakes in judgment and execution, which have led to damaged relations and crises in various regions. However, the US system is designed to change, and Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize and correct his mistakes. Bush's willingness to admit errors and embrace change led to a sweeping reordering of his administration and improved results in various areas. Obama would be wise to adopt a similar approach, acknowledging his shortcomings and leading administration-wide change from within. END OF SUMMARY.
