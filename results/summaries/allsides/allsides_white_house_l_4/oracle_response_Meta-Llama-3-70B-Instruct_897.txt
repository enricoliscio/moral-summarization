SUMMARY: The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed policies, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration to the reactive disengagement of the Obama administration. The US has swung from one mistake to another, damaging relations and creating crises around the world. However, the author argues that these errors can be fixed, citing the example of George W. Bush, who recognized his mistakes and instituted sweeping changes in his second term. Bush replaced key officials, modified policies, and brought in new perspectives, leading to improved results in various regions. In contrast, Obama is seen as aloof from his Cabinet and has failed to admit his mistakes. The author suggests that Obama could learn from Bush's example, recognizing his errors and leading administration-wide change from within. By doing so, Obama can begin to grow in office and address the strains and dysfunctions that have plagued US foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
