Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary of around 200 words, making sure to include as many of those moral terms as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, highlighting the flawed policies under Bush and Obama. It mentions the Iraq invasion under Bush and the disengagement under Obama. The author points out the need for leaders to admit mistakes and change course, using Bush's second term as an example where he made significant changes, which led to better outcomes.

I need to identify key moral terms from the list provided. Words like "invasion," "disengagement," "dithering," "eavesdropping," "mistakes," "instituted," "reordering," "replaced," "modified," "changed," "launched," "initiated," "fighting," "terror," "bring," "bucked," "restoring," "back," "sidelined," "strains," "dysfunctions," "give," "punt," "play," "stand," "lead" are important.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the main issues under both presidents, the need for admitting mistakes, and the example of Bush's corrective actions. I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the problems, then the need for change, and concluding with the example of Bush's leadership.

I should also keep the summary within 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary moral terms without making it too lengthy. I'll make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's message about the importance of leadership in admitting and correcting mistakes.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each paragraph is clear and each sentence includes the appropriate moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure all key points are covered.

SUMMARY:  
Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions, from the Iraq invasion under George W. Bush to Barack Obama's disengagement and dithering. The nation has faced crises in regions like Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine, as well as strained relations with allies due to NSA eavesdropping. Obama, however, is not doomed to repeat these mistakes. The article highlights the importance of leaders recognizing and correcting errors, using Bush's second term as an example. Bush acknowledged his mistakes, reordering his administration by replacing key officials and modifying policies, such as the Iraq surge and a "light footprint" approach to fighting terror. These changes led to improved outcomes, including better relations with allies and progress in war zones. In contrast, Obama's aloofness and White House-centric approach have sidelined his Cabinet. The author suggests that Obama could learn from Bush's ability to admit errors, stand up to himself, and lead change, even if their leadership styles differ. The article emphasizes that in times of foreign policy strains and dysfunctions, leaders must avoid giving up, punting to the future, or playing the blame game, instead choosing to stand and lead with integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
