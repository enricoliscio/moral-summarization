SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the flaws in US foreign policy since 9/11, criticizing both the Bush and Obama administrations for their mistakes. The author argues that the US has swung from one flawed policy to another, from unilateralism to disengagement, and that the nation's problems are partly due to a heightened sense of vulnerability and dysfunctional politics. However, the author also suggests that some of these errors can be fixed, and that Obama can learn from George W. Bush's ability to recognize and correct his mistakes. Bush's willingness to admit errors and institute change in his second term led to improved results in various regions, including Iraq, Africa, and relations with allies. The article encourages Obama to adopt a similar approach, recognizing his own mistakes and embracing change, rather than being aloof from his Cabinet and playing the blame game. By doing so, Obama can grow in office and lead administration-wide change.
