SUMMARY: In the years following the September 11 attacks, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by a series of flawed approaches and errors in judgment, swinging from the unilateralism of the Bush administration's first term to the disengagement and dithering of the Obama administration. Despite this, there is hope for improvement as Obama has an opportunity to learn from his predecessor, George W. Bush, who recognized the need for change and instituted sweeping personnel and policy changes during his second term. Bush's willingness to admit mistakes and embrace change may have stemmed from his own past failures, and he actively sought outside perspectives for his second-term team, in contrast to Obama's more insular approach. Bush's ability to lead his administration through tough times and demand self-accountability is something Obama can emulate to bring about much-needed change.
END OF SUMMARY.
