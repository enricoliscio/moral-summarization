SUMMARY:

The period since 9/11 has been marked by a series of flawed policies, from the unilateralist excess of the Bush administration to the reactive disengagement and dithering of the Obama administration. The US has swung from one mistake to another, leading to damaged relations and crises around the world. However, the author argues that Obama can still change course and produce constructive change by recognizing his mistakes and instituting reforms. The author points to George W. Bush as a model, who in his second term recognized the need for change and reordered his administration, replacing key officials and modifying policies. Bush's willingness to admit errors and bring in new perspectives led to better results in various regions. In contrast, Obama is seen as aloof from his Cabinet, leading to feelings of being sidelined. The author urges Obama to learn from Bush's example and stand up to himself, admitting mistakes and leading administration-wide change from within. END OF SUMMARY.
