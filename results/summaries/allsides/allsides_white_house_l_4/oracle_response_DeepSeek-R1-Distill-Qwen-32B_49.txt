Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's a critique of U.S. foreign policy since 9/11, comparing Bush and Obama's approaches. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to include those in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main points. The article talks about Bush's unilateralism leading to the Iraq invasion, Obama's disengagement, and the resulting issues. It also highlights Bush's ability to admit mistakes and make changes, which Obama could learn from.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the flawed policies under both presidents, the need for change, and Bush's example. I'll use the moral words like "invasion," "disengagement," "mistakes," and "lead" to maintain the framing.

Also, the user wants the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly without markdown. I'll check to ensure I'm not missing any key points and that the summary flows logically, emphasizing the moral aspects as the author intended.

SUMMARY: Since September 11, 2001, U.S. foreign policy has been marked by flawed decisions and a lack of constructive change. The Bush administration's unilateralist approach, including the invasion of Iraq, set a problematic precedent. Obama's tenure saw disengagement and dithering, with Iraq again becoming a symbol of policy failures. The U.S. has faced crises in Syria, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Africa, as well as strained relations with allies over NSA eavesdropping. While some issues stem from heightened vulnerability and dysfunctional politics, others are tied to human errors that could be corrected. Bush, despite his mistakes, demonstrated the ability to admit errors and institute sweeping changes, such as replacing key officials and modifying policies. His willingness to stand up to himself and lead change offers a model for Obama, who has been seen as aloof from his Cabinet. Bush's approach, including bringing in new perspectives and actively supporting his team, contrasts with Obama's White House-centric strategy, which has left Cabinet members sidelined. Learning from Bush's example, Obama could embrace change and lead the U.S. through its current strains and dysfunctions. END OF SUMMARY.
