SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. This decision is hailed as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, as it marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" by the government against houses of worship and religious leaders. The governor's administration had "abused" the COVID-19 pandemic to restrict religious liberty, but the lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society have secured the fundamental freedom of religion. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health recommends remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals, but does not obligate or encourage in-person activity. This decision is a critical step in preserving the freedom of religion, which is "essential" to a self-governing democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
