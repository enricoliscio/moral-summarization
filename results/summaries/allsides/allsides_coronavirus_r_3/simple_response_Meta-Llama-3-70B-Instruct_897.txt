SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious freedom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement replaces mandates on Illinois churches with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, allowing churches to resume in-person services without numerical limits. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, emphasizing that the fundamental freedom of religion is critical to a self-governing democracy. The lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society had previously led to the lifting of restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. The firm's Vice President and Senior Counsel, Peter Breen, criticized the governor's initial actions as a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders.
