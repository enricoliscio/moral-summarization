SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm hailed the decision as a victory for religious freedom and liberty, stating that the governor had abused his power and stomped on the rights of people of faith. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health will now be recommendations instead of mandates, with a focus on trying to keep people safe while facilitating in-person religious activities. 

The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against the governor's previous orders, representing multiple churches and their pastors. As a consequence of these lawsuits, the governor has loosened and lifted restrictions on drive-in and outdoor religious services, respectively, ultimately removing all mandates against how and where religious groups can practice their faith. The firm emphasized that people of faith should not have had to secure their basic rights through repeated lawsuits and that the end of these restrictions marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination against houses of worship.
END OF SUMMARY.
