SUMMARY:
The Thomas More Society hailed Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's decision to withdraw restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic as a "total and complete victory for people of faith." The nonprofit law firm had filed multiple lawsuits challenging the governor's previous mandates limiting in-person gatherings at churches to 10 or fewer people. In response to the lawsuits, Pritzker replaced the mandates with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, acknowledging that religious activities are essential. The Thomas More Society argued that Pritzker's initial restrictions discriminated against people of faith and infringed on their fundamental rights. They emphasized that the freedom to practice religion is critical in a self-governing democracy. As a result of the lawsuits, Pritzker also loosened restrictions on drive-in and outdoor religious services. The society celebrated the outcome as a victory for religious freedom, declaring that people of faith can now breathe freer while also acknowledging that it should not have taken repeated legal action to secure their basic rights.
