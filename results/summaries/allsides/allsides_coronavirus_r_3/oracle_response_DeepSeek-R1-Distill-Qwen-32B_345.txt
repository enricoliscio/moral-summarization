Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker removing restrictions on religious services after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The society sees this as a victory for religious freedom. The governor had previously limited church gatherings, but now it's just recommendations. The society criticizes the governor for abusing power and discriminating against religious groups, while the governor's office says they're trying to keep people safe.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "victory," "abused," "liberty," "discrimination," "freedom," "restrictions," etc., are important. I should make sure the summary reflects the conflict between the governor's actions and the society's stance on religious freedom.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the governor's action, then the society's reaction as a victory, the details of the lawsuits, and the governor's response. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn mandatory restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm celebrated this as a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom, stating that Pritzker had "abused" the pandemic to "stomp" on the "liberty" of Illinois residents. The governor replaced mandatory limits on church gatherings with non-binding health recommendations, emphasizing that in-person services should remain remote, especially for vulnerable populations. The Thomas More Society criticized the previous restrictions as discriminatory and a violation of fundamental "freedom of religion," which they argued is "critical" to democracy. The society filed multiple lawsuits, leading to the "loosening" and "lifting" of restrictions, including those on drive-in and outdoor services. A spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Health stated that religious activities were always considered essential and that the updated guidance aimed to balance "worship options" with safety. The society declared the outcome a "complete victory" for Illinois churches, while Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.  
END OF SUMMARY.
