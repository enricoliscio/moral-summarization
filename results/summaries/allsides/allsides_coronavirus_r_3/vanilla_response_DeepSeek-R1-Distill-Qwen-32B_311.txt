Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let's read through it carefully. The main points are about the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, removing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. They filed three lawsuits, which led to the governor dropping the mandates. Now, instead of mandatory limits, there are recommendations, but the health department still advises remote services, especially for vulnerable groups. The society sees this as a victory for religious freedom, while the governor's administration claims religious activities were always essential. I should include the key details: who was involved, what the restrictions were, how the lawsuits impacted the decision, and the current status of the guidelines. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the essential information without getting too bogged down in specifics. Also, end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has lifted mandatory restrictions on religious services following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The governor replaced the previous mandates, which limited church gatherings to 10 people, with non-binding recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. Health officials advised continuing remote services, especially for vulnerable populations. The Thomas More Society called the move a victory for religious freedom, stating that the governor's guidelines no longer enforce in-person worship. The society filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's restrictions, leading to the removal of limits on drive-in and outdoor services. While the governor's administration maintained that religious activities were always deemed essential, the society criticized the government for its earlier discrimination against churches. END OF SUMMARY.
