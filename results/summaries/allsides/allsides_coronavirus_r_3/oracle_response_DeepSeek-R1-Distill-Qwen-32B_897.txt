Okay, so I'm trying to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, lifted restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. They called it a victory for religious freedom. The governor replaced mandatory restrictions with health recommendations, suggesting that remote services are still better for vulnerable people. The society criticized the governor for abusing power and discriminating against religious groups, and they filed multiple lawsuits which led to the restrictions being loosened. The governor's office stated that religious activities are essential and the new guidelines aim to balance worship options with safety.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key morally framed words: facilitate, victory, limits, activities, abused, stomp, liberty, restrictions, freedom, had, secure, end, discrimination, trying, safe, loosened, lifted, services, removed, practice.

I'll start by mentioning the governor withdrawing restrictions after lawsuits, calling it a victory. Then, explain the replacement of mandates with recommendations, emphasizing the health department's advice on remote services. Highlight the society's criticism of the governor abusing power and discrimination. Mention the lawsuits leading to loosened restrictions, including drive-in and outdoor services. Conclude with the governor's statement on essential activities and balancing safety with worship options.

I need to make sure each sentence flows and includes the necessary moral terms without making it too wordy. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring all key points and moral words are included concisely.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, which hailed the move as a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom. The governor replaced mandatory limits on church activities with health recommendations, stating that remote services are still strongly encouraged, particularly for vulnerable groups. The Thomas More Society criticized Pritzker for "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp" on religious liberty, calling the removal of restrictions a win for "fundamental freedom of religion." The society filed multiple lawsuits against Pritzker's orders, leading to the loosening of restrictions, including the lifting of bans on drive-in and outdoor services. A spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Health emphasized that religious activities are "essential" and the new guidelines aim to "try" to keep people "safe" while allowing more worship options. The society condemned the governor's actions as "discrimination" against religious groups, asserting that "people of faith" should no longer have to fight for their rights in court. END OF SUMMARY.
