SUMMARY:

In a major victory for people of faith, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's decision is seen as a complete and total victory for churches in Illinois, as it removes mandates on in-person services and replaces them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The Thomas More Society hailed the move as a win for religious liberty, stating that the governor and his administration had "abused" the pandemic to "stomp" on the religious freedom of Illinois citizens. The society's Vice President, Peter Breen, emphasized that the fundamental freedom of religion is "critical to a self-governing democracy." The decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders. With this move, people of faith in Illinois can "breathe a little freer" and practice their religion without restrictions.
