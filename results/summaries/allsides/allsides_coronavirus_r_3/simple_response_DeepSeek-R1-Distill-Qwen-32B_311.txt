Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, withdrawing restrictions on religious services during the pandemic after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. 

I need to capture the key events: the governor lifting the mandates, the replacement with recommendations, the reaction from the Thomas More Society, and the context of the lawsuits. The moral framing here is about religious freedom and government overreach, so I should highlight that perspective.

I should mention the lawsuits, the governor's response, the health department's stance, and the society's view on it being a victory for religious liberty. Also, note the initial restrictions and how they were lifted through legal action. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral angle the author presented. I'll structure it to show the conflict, the resolution, and the implications for religious freedom. Let me piece together the main points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The governor initially required churches to limit gatherings to 10 people, but these mandates have been replaced by non-binding health recommendations. Health officials advised continuing remote services, especially for vulnerable populations, but the Thomas More Society celebrated this change as a victory for religious freedom. Vice President Peter Breen criticized the governor for abusing the pandemic to restrict religious liberty and praised the outcome as a win for faith communities. The society had filed three lawsuits against Pritzker, leading to the removal of restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services. Breen emphasized the importance of religious freedom in a democracy and criticized the need for repeated legal battles to secure these rights. The Illinois Department of Health stated that religious activities were always considered essential and that the updated guidelines aimed to balance worship options with safety. END OF SUMMARY.
