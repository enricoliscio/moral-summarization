SUMMARY: Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services that were implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm celebrated the decision as a victory for religious freedom, as the mandates will now be replaced by recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The Thomas More Society had filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's order, representing churches and pastors in Illinois who felt their religious liberties were being infringed upon. The lawsuits argued that Pritzker's restrictions unfairly targeted religious gatherings, and as a result, the governor has loosened restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services, in addition to removing mandates on the number of people present at services. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential and that the updated guidance is intended to balance the resumption of worship services with the need to keep people safe. The Thomas More Society declared the outcome as a "total and complete victory for people of faith," emphasizing the fundamental importance of religious freedom in a democratic society.
END OF SUMMARY.
