SUMMARY:

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor announced that he would remove mandates on Illinois churches, which previously limited services to 10 people or less, and replace them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The new guidance strongly recommends that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, hailed the announcement as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, citing that the governor's previous restrictions were an abuse of power and a violation of religious liberty. The firm had filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's order on behalf of various churches and religious leaders.

END OF SUMMARY.
