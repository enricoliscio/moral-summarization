Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is about the Illinois governor lifting restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective, which seems to highlight the victory for religious freedom and the government's overreach.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The governor, J.B. Pritzker, removed the mandates on church gatherings after being sued. The society sees this as a win for religious liberty. The health department is now giving recommendations instead of strict rules, encouraging remote services but not mandating them. The society's spokesperson, Peter Breen, calls it a victory and criticizes the governor for abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious rights. They also mention that the governor had to lift other restrictions after previous lawsuits.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the governor withdrew restrictions following lawsuits. Then mention the society's view as a victory for religious freedom. Include the shift from mandates to recommendations, the health department's stance, and Breen's comments on the governor's actions. Also, note the previous lawsuits leading to other restrictions being lifted.

I should ensure the moral angle is clearâ€”emphasizing the protection of religious rights and the government's overreach. Keep the tone consistent with the original article's framing, highlighting the positive outcome for the churches and the negative critique of the governor's initial actions.

Let me structure the summary: start with the governor's action, the society's reaction, the change from mandates to recommendations, Breen's statements, the health department's position, and the impact of prior lawsuits. Make sure it's concise and within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each key point is included without exceeding the word count.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted mandatory restrictions on religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The society celebrated this decision as a victory for religious freedom, stating that Pritzker's initial restrictions on church activities were an overreach. The governor replaced the mandates with non-binding health recommendations, allowing churches to decide whether to resume in-person services. Health officials emphasized the importance of remote services, particularly for vulnerable populations, but did not enforce any restrictions. Peter Breen of the Thomas More Society criticized Pritzker for abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious liberty, calling the outcome a "total and complete victory" for people of faith. The society had previously filed three lawsuits against Pritzker, leading to the removal of other restrictions, such as limits on drive-in and outdoor services. The governor's decision was seen as a step toward protecting religious freedom, though Breen noted that churches should not have had to sue to secure their rights.  
END OF SUMMARY.
