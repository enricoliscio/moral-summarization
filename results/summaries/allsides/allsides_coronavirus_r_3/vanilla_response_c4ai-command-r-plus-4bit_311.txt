SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services that were implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic following multiple lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm filed three lawsuits against Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker's orders, representing several churches in the state. The lawsuits argued that the restrictions on in-person religious services violated religious freedom. As a result of the lawsuits, Pritzker has replaced the mandates with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, which emphasize that remote services are still strongly recommended. The Thomas More Society declared the outcome as a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom in Illinois, with Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen stating that fundamental freedom of religion is critical in a self-governing democracy. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic, and the updated guidance aims to balance the desire for in-person worship with the need to keep people safe.
END OF SUMMARY.
