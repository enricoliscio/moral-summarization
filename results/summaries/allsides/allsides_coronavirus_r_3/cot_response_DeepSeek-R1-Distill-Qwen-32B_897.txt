Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the context and the key points. The article is about the Governor of Illinois removing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. 

I notice that the user has specified two main tasks: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. 

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "withdrawn," "restrictions," "victory," "mandates," "abused," "discrimination," "freedom," "critical," "basic rights," "shameful," "essential," and "safeguard" come to mind. These words are used to convey the moral stance of the parties involved, especially highlighting the conflict between religious freedom and pandemic restrictions.

Next, for the summary, I need to ensure it's concise, no more than 200 words, and includes the identified morally framed words. I'll start by stating that the Governor withdrew restrictions, mention the lawsuits by the Thomas More Society, and highlight the victory for religious freedom. I should also include the health department's stance, the Governor's actions in response to the lawsuits, and the societal implications regarding freedom and discrimination.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first state the main action, then the reasons behind it, the reactions from both sides, and the broader implications.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets all the requirements and that the morally framed words are appropriately included to maintain the original tone and message of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, withdrew restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The Society celebrated this as a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom, as the governor replaced mandatory limits on church gatherings with non-binding health recommendations. Health officials emphasized that remote services were still strongly advised, particularly for vulnerable populations. The Society criticized Pritzker for abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious liberty, calling the previous restrictions a "shameful chapter of discrimination." The governor's administration acknowledged that religious activities are essential and adjusted guidelines to balance safety with worship options. The Society filed multiple lawsuits, leading to the removal of restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services, and ultimately all mandates. The outcome was seen as a win for religious freedom but highlighted the need for legal battles to secure basic rights.
