SUMMARY:
In a victory for religious freedom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The law firm hailed the decision as a win for people of faith, as Pritzker replaced mandates on churches with mere recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The updated guidance is a complete reversal of the previous restrictions, which the Thomas More Society argued were an abuse of power and a shameful act of discrimination against religious institutions. The firm filed multiple lawsuits on behalf of churches in Illinois, challenging Pritzker's orders as a violation of fundamental rights. According to a spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health, religious activities have always been deemed essential. The governor's decision to loosen restrictions is a recognition of the critical importance of freedom of religion in a self-governing democracy and a victory for the basic rights of Illinois residents.
