Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, who removed restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The society sees this as a victory for religious freedom. The governor had previously limited church gatherings, but now it's just recommendations. The society criticizes the governor for abusing power and discriminating against religious groups. They filed multiple lawsuits, leading to the lifting of restrictions.

I need to highlight the moral aspects using words like "victory," "abused," "liberty," "discrimination," "freedom," etc. I'll structure the summary to show the conflict, the actions taken, and the outcomes, making sure to include the key moral terms.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start by stating the governor's action, then the society's reaction, the reasons behind it, and the implications for religious freedom. I'll end by mentioning the loosening of restrictions and the government's response.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is appropriately placed without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary captures the essence of the article from the moral perspective presented.

SUMMARY: The Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn mandatory restrictions on religious services during the coronavirus pandemic after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, which called the move a "total and complete victory" for people of faith. The governor replaced the mandates, which limited church gatherings to 10 or fewer people, with non-binding recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. Health officials emphasized that remote services should continue, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society criticized Pritzker for "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp" on religious liberty and declared an end to "shameful discrimination" against houses of worship. The society filed three lawsuits, leading to the loosening of restrictions, including the lifting of limits on drive-in and outdoor services. Pritzker's administration acknowledged that religious activities are essential and aimed to balance safety with worship options. The society emphasized the importance of securing fundamental religious freedom in a democracy, while Pritzker's office did not immediately respond to the developments. END OF SUMMARY.
