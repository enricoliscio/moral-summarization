SUMMARY:

In a victory for religious freedom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement replaces mandates with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, allowing churches to operate without numerical limits. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, stating that the governor's previous restrictions were an abuse of power and a threat to religious liberty. The society's Vice President, Peter Breen, emphasized that fundamental freedom of religion is critical to a self-governing democracy and that people of faith should "breathe a little freer" now. The decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders.
