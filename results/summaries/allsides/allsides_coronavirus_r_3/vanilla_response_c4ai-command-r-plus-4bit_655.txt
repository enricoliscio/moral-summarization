SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has lifted restrictions on religious services that were put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm celebrated the decision as a victory for religious freedom, as the previous mandates limited religious services to no more than 10 people. The governor's new guidance will be based on recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, which emphasizes remote services. Peter Breen, Vice President and Senior Counsel of the Thomas More Society, called the decision a "total and complete victory for people of faith," and criticized the initial restrictions as an abuse of power. The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against the governor's orders on behalf of churches in Illinois, arguing that the restrictions discriminated against religious organizations. As a result of these lawsuits, the governor loosened restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services, and eventually lifted all mandates against religious practices in the state. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health stated that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic, and that the updated guidance aims to balance worship options with public safety.
END OF SUMMARY.
