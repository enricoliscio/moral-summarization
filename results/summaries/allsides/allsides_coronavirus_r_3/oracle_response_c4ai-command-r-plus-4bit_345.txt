SUMMARY: In a victory for religious freedom, Illinois' governor has lifted restrictions on religious services put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. The nonprofit law firm Thomas More Society had filed lawsuits against the governor, alleging that he had abused his power and imposed limits on religious activities. The firm argued that the governor's actions were a form of discrimination against people of faith and a stomping on their fundamental freedom of religion. As a result of the lawsuits, the governor has now removed all mandates and replaced them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. This change allows churches and religious leaders to facilitate in-person services while still encouraging remote options for vulnerable individuals. According to the Thomas More Society, this is a complete victory for the churches and people of Illinois, who can now practice their religion without restrictions. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential and that the updated guidance aims to balance worship options with keeping people safe. The end of these restrictions marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination against houses of worship in the state.
END OF SUMMARY.
