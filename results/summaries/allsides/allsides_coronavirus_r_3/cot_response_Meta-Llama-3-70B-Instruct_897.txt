SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, as the mandates will be replaced by recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The governor's administration was accused of "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp on the religious liberty" of Illinois residents. The Thomas More Society's Vice President, Peter Breen, emphasized that the fundamental "freedom of religion" is "critical to a self-governing democracy." The decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders. The updated guidance is designed to balance the desire for more worship options with the need to keep people safe. END OF SUMMARY.
