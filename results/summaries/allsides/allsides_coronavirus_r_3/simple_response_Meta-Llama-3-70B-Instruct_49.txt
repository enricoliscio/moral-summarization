SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious freedom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement replaces mandates on churches with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, allowing places of worship to resume in-person activities without restrictions. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, citing the fundamental freedom of religion as "critical to a self-governing democracy." The lawsuits filed by the nonprofit law firm had previously led to the lifting of restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. The governor's decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders. The updated guidance prioritizes safety while respecting the desire for more worship options.
