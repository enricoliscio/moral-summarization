SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious liberty, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's decision marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination by the government against houses of worship and religious leaders. The new guidance from the Illinois Department of Health replaces mandates with recommendations, strongly advising places of worship to continue facilitating remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society hailed the move as a total and complete victory for people of faith, emphasizing that fundamental freedom of religion is critical to a self-governing democracy. The governor's administration had previously abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois, but has now lifted all mandates against how and where churches and people can practice their religion. This decision is a significant step towards securing the basic rights of religious individuals and institutions.
