SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm argued that the restrictions violated religious liberty and freedom of worship, and the governor's decision to replace mandates with recommendations is being hailed as a victory for people of faith.

Peter Breen, Vice President and Senior Counsel of the Thomas More Society, stated that the governor of Illinois abused his power during the COVID-19 pandemic to infringe on the religious liberty of its citizens. He emphasized that freedom of religion is critical to a self-governing democracy and that religious institutions should not have had to resort to legal action to protect their basic rights.

The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against the governor's orders, representing multiple churches and their pastors. As a result of these lawsuits, the governor loosened restrictions not only on indoor religious services but also on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. The updated guidance now treats religious activities as essential and aims to balance the desire for worship options with the need to keep people safe.

This outcome is seen as a victory for religious freedom and a step towards ensuring that governments do not overstep their bounds in times of crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
