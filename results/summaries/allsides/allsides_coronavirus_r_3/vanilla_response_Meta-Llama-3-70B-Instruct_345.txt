SUMMARY:

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor announced that he would remove mandates on Illinois churches, which previously limited services to 10 people or less, and replace them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The department emphasized that places of worship should continue to facilitate remote services, especially for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, hailed the announcement as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, stating that the governor's actions were a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship. The firm had filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's order on behalf of various churches and pastors. The withdrawal of restrictions marks a significant win for religious liberty in Illinois.
