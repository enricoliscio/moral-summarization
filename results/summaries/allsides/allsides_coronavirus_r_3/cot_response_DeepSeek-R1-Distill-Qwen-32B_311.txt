Okay, so the user has provided a news article about the governor of Illinois lifting restrictions on religious services following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. They want me to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "abused," "discrimination," "victory," "freedom," "critical," "shameful," "rights," "mandatory," "loosened," "oppression," "oppress," "oppressed," "abridging," and "oppressed" stand out as they relate to moral or ethical issues.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article, highlighting the moral aspects. I'll structure it to mention the governor's action, the lawsuits, the victory for religious groups, the moral arguments made, and the implications for religious freedom.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing without being too verbose. I'll start by stating the governor's decision, then mention the lawsuits and the society's view as a victory. I'll include the health department's recommendations and the society's criticism of the governor's actions. Finally, I'll note the loosening of restrictions and the broader implications for religious freedom.

I should double-check that all key points are covered and that the moral language is appropriately included. The summary should reflect the tension between public health measures and religious freedom, emphasizing the legal and moral battle fought by the churches.

**SUMMARY:**  
Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois lifted mandatory restrictions on religious services after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The Society called the move a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom, criticizing the governor for "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp on the religious liberty" of Illinois residents. The Illinois Department of Health replaced mandates with recommendations, encouraging remote services but not obligating in-person gatherings. The Society filed three lawsuits, leading to the removal of restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services. They accused the governor of "discrimination" and "oppression" of religious groups. Health officials stated religious activities were always deemed essential, but the Society emphasized the importance of "fundamental freedom of religion" in a democracy. The governor's actions were seen as a response to legal challenges, with the Society declaring an end to a "shameful chapter" of government overreach.
