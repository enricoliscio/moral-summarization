Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, removing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The society is a nonprofit law firm, and they're celebrating this as a victory. The governor had previously limited church gatherings to 10 people, but now it's just recommendations from the health department, not mandates.

I notice that the author uses phrases like "victory for people of faith" and mentions that the governor "abused the pandemic" to infringe on religious liberty. There's also a focus on the legal battles, with multiple lawsuits leading to the restrictions being lifted. The society emphasizes the importance of religious freedom in a democracy and criticizes the governor for forcing churches to fight for their rights.

I should make sure the summary reflects that the Thomas More Society sees this as a moral victory, highlighting the governor's actions as overstepping and infringing on religious freedom. Also, the shift from mandates to recommendations is a key point, showing the impact of the lawsuits.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the main points: the governor lifting restrictions, the role of the lawsuits, the moral stance on religious freedom, and the health department's recommendations. I'll structure it to show the cause and effect, emphasizing the victory for religious groups and the criticism of the governor's initial actions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to capture the moral framing without adding my own opinions. I'll focus on the key events and the perspectives presented by the Thomas More Society and the governor's response.

SUMMARY:  
The Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The Society celebrated this as a victory, as the governor had previously mandated limits on church gatherings, such as capping attendance at 10 people. The new guidance now only recommends remote services, particularly for vulnerable groups, rather than enforcing mandatory restrictions. The Society criticized Pritzker for abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious freedom, calling the change a "total and complete victory" for Illinois churches. The governor's administration argued that religious activities were always considered essential and that the updated guidelines aimed to balance worship options with safety. The Society filed multiple lawsuits, including cases on behalf of The Beloved Church, Jesus House Restoration Ministries, and five Lake County churches, leading to the relaxation of restrictions. Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment. The Society emphasized the importance of religious freedom in a democracy and criticized the need for repeated legal battles to secure these rights.  
END OF SUMMARY.
