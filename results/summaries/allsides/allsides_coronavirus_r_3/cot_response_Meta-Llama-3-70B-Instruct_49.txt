SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, marking a "total and complete victory" for people of faith. The governor's administration had "abused" the pandemic to "stomp" on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois. The new guidance from the Illinois Department of Health replaces mandates with recommendations, allowing churches to resume in-person activities. The Thomas More Society hailed this as a "critical" win for fundamental freedom of religion, which is "essential" to a self-governing democracy. The lawsuits filed against the governor's orders had previously led to the lifting of restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. This decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter" of discrimination against houses of worship and religious leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
