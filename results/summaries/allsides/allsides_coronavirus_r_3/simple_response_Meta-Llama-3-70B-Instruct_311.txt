SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious freedom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement marks a complete victory for people of faith, as the previous mandates limiting church attendance to 10 people have been replaced with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision, stating that the governor's administration had "abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois." The society's Vice President and Senior Counsel, Peter Breen, emphasized that the fundamental freedom of religion is "critical to a self-governing democracy." The decision is a significant win for religious leaders and houses of worship, who should no longer face discrimination from the government.
