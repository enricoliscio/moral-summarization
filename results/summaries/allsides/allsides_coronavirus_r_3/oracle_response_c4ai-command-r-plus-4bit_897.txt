SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services, marking a victory for religious freedom in the state. The Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, filed multiple lawsuits against Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's mandates, which limited religious activities and abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of Illinoisans. As a result of these legal challenges, Pritzker has now lifted all restrictions on how and where Illinois residents can practice their religion. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health strongly recommends that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals, but it is no longer mandatory. This marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination against houses of worship and religious leaders in Illinois. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a total and complete victory for people of faith, emphasizing that the fundamental freedom to practice one's religion is critical to a self-governing democracy. While the governor did not immediately respond to requests for comment, a spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic, and that the new guidance is designed to balance the desire for in-person worship with keeping people safe.
END OF SUMMARY.
