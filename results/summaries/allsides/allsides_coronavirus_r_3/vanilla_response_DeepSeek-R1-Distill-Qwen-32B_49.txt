Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, withdrawing restrictions on religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. It mentions that this happened after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. 

Okay, so the governor had previously imposed mandates that limited church services to 10 or more people. Now, he's removing those mandates and replacing them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The health officials are advising against in-person services, especially for vulnerable groups, but it's no longer mandatory.

The Thomas More Society is celebrating this as a victory. They filed multiple lawsuits against Pritzker, which led to the changes. The governor's administration is accused of abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious freedom. The society points out that this was a necessary legal battle, and the governor has now loosened other restrictions as a result of these lawsuits.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: the governor removing restrictions, the role of the Thomas More Society's lawsuits, the shift from mandates to recommendations, the health department's advice, and the societal reaction regarding religious freedom.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main action, then the cause, the response from the health department, and the implications regarding religious freedom. Also, mention that the governor didn't respond immediately to the request for comment.

Let me make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward.
