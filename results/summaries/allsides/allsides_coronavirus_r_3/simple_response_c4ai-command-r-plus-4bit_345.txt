SUMMARY: The Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, has successfully challenged Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's restrictions on religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. The governor's mandates, which limited the number of people present at religious services to 10 or fewer, have been replaced by recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. This change is being hailed as a victory for religious freedom by the Thomas More Society, who argued that the restrictions were an abuse of power and discriminated against houses of worship. The firm filed three lawsuits on behalf of churches in Illinois, challenging the restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services, as well as the overall limit on the number of people at services. As a result of these legal challenges, Governor Pritzker has now lifted all mandates against religious practices in Illinois. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic, and the updated guidance is designed to balance the desire for in-person worship with the need to keep people safe. This outcome is seen as a significant victory for the fundamental freedom of religion and a reaffirmation of the rights of religious leaders and their congregations. END OF SUMMARY.
