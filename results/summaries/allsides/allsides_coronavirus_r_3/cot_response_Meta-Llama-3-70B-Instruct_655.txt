SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, marking a "total and complete victory" for people of faith. The governor's administration was accused of "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp" on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois. The new guidance replaces mandates with recommendations, allowing churches to decide how to conduct services while prioritizing safety. This move is seen as a "critical" step in protecting the "fundamental freedom of religion" in a "self-governing democracy." The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "victory" after filing multiple lawsuits against the governor's orders, which were deemed "shameful" and "discriminatory" towards houses of worship.
