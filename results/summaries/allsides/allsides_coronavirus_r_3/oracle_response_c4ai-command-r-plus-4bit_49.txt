SUMMARY: The Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, has secured a victory for religious freedom in Illinois amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The firm filed multiple lawsuits against Governor J.B. Pritzker's orders, which imposed limits on religious activities and abused the power of the state to stomp on the religious liberty of its citizens. As a result of these legal challenges, Pritzker has now lifted all mandates against religious practices in Illinois. 

The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health strongly recommends that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. However, the removal of restrictions on religious services is a significant win for the fundamental freedom of religion in the state. 

According to the Thomas More Society, Pritzker's previous orders discriminated against houses of worship and religious leaders. The firm filed lawsuits on behalf of multiple churches and pastors, challenging the governor's restrictions on drive-in and outdoor religious services. As a consequence of these lawsuits, Pritzker loosened his restrictions, ultimately leading to the complete removal of all mandates. This victory ensures that people of faith in Illinois can now practice their religion freely, without unnecessary government interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
