SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious liberty, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement marks a complete and total victory for people of faith, allowing them to practice their religion without arbitrary limits. The Thomas More Society hailed the move, saying it ended a shameful chapter of discrimination by the government against houses of worship and religious leaders. The governor's administration had abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois, but has now handed a complete victory to the churches. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health recommends remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals, but does not obligate or encourage in-person activity. This move is a significant step towards securing the fundamental freedom of religion, critical to a self-governing democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
