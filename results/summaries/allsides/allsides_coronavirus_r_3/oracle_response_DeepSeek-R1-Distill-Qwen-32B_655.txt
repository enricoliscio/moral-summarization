Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the Illinois governor lifting restrictions on religious services after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The author uses words like "victory," "abused," "liberty," "discrimination," etc., which carry moral connotations.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The governor, J.B. Pritzker, removed mandates on church gatherings due to lawsuits. The Thomas More Society sees this as a victory for religious freedom. The health department now has recommendations instead of strict rules, encouraging remote services but not mandating them. The society filed multiple lawsuits, leading to the lifting of restrictions. They argue the governor abused his power, which is a strong moral statement. The governor's administration claims religious activities were always essential and the new guidelines balance worship options with safety.

I need to include the morally framed words without changing the meaning. I'll structure the summary to highlight the victory, the abuse of power, the impact on religious liberty, and the end of discrimination. I should also mention the lawsuits and the resulting loosening of restrictions. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn mandatory restrictions on religious services following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The society declared this a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom, as the governor replaced strict mandates with non-binding health recommendations. The Illinois Department of Health emphasized that remote services should continue, particularly for vulnerable groups, but the change was seen as a win for churches. The society criticized Pritzker for "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp" on religious liberty, calling the previous restrictions a form of "discrimination." The governor's administration loosened other restrictions in response to the lawsuits, including allowing drive-in and outdoor services. The society highlighted that "fundamental freedom of religion" is "critical" to democracy and criticized the need for repeated legal battles to secure these rights. The updated guidelines aim to balance worship options with safety, though the society remains critical of the government's initial actions. END OF SUMMARY.
