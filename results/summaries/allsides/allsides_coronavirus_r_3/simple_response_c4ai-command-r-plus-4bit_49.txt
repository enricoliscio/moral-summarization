SUMMARY: In a victory for religious freedom, Illinois' governor has withdrawn restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm argued that the restrictions imposed by the governor, J.B. Pritzker, unfairly targeted religious gatherings and violated the fundamental right to freedom of religion. As a result of the lawsuits, Pritzker has replaced mandates with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, emphasizing that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic. The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits on behalf of churches and pastors in Illinois, arguing that the restrictions were discriminatory and a violation of their basic rights. Peter Breen, vice president and senior counsel of the Thomas More Society, hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory for people of faith," emphasizing that freedom of religion is critical to a self-governing democracy. The spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health also acknowledged the importance of worship while striving to keep people safe. This outcome sends a strong message against government discrimination and affirms the fundamental right to religious freedom.
END OF SUMMARY.
