SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted restrictions on religious services implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic. This decision comes after multiple lawsuits were filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm, challenging the mandates that limited religious gatherings to 10 people or fewer. The updated guidance, provided by the Illinois Department of Health, now offers recommendations instead of mandates for religious services. While remote services are still strongly recommended, particularly for vulnerable individuals, the new guidance allows for in-person gatherings while encouraging safety precautions. Peter Breen, Vice President and Senior Counsel of the Thomas More Society, hailed the decision as a victory for religious freedom, stating that fundamental freedoms are critical in a democracy. He also emphasized that it should not have taken multiple lawsuits to secure these basic rights. A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential and that the updated guidance aims to balance worship options with safety measures. The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against the governor's orders, leading to the gradual lifting of restrictions on drive-in services, outdoor religious services, and ultimately, all mandates against religious gatherings.
END OF SUMMARY.
