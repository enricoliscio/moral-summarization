SUMMARY:

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor announced that he would remove mandates on Illinois churches, which previously limited services to 10 people or less, and replace them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The department emphasized that places of worship should continue to facilitate remote services, especially for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, after filing multiple lawsuits against the governor's restrictions. The firm argued that the governor's orders had discriminated against houses of worship and religious leaders. The governor's decision marks a shift towards guidelines rather than mandates, allowing churches to practice their religion without restrictions.

END OF SUMMARY.
