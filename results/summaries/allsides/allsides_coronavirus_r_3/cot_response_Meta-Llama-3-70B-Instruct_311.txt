SUMMARY:
In a major victory for people of faith, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's decision is a complete and total victory for churches in Illinois, marking the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination by the government against houses of worship and religious leaders. The new guidance from the Illinois Department of Health replaces mandates with recommendations, strongly advising places of worship to continue facilitating remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. This move is a critical step in protecting the fundamental freedom of religion, essential to a self-governing democracy. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a triumph, emphasizing that people of faith across Illinois can now breathe a little freer. END OF SUMMARY.
