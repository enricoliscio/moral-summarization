Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, withdrawing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The society sees this as a victory for religious freedom, while the governor's administration argues that they're trying to balance safety with worship options.

I should identify the key elements: the action taken by the governor, the role of the lawsuits, the response from the Thomas More Society, and the broader implications regarding religious freedom and government overreach. The moral framing here emphasizes the conflict between public health measures and individual freedoms, particularly religious ones.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the moral debate. I'll start by stating the governor's action, mention the lawsuits, highlight the society's victory, and then touch on the health department's stance. I'll conclude with the broader implications of the decision, tying it back to the moral argument about religious liberty.

I should also make sure to include quotes that highlight the moral perspective, like Breen's comments about the victory for people of faith and the importance of religious freedom in a democracy. This will help preserve the author's framing.

Now, I'll structure the summary to flow logically: starting with the governor's decision, the cause (lawsuits), the response from the society, the health department's position, and the implications. I'll keep each sentence focused and avoid unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear, accurate, and maintains the moral angle presented in the original article.

SUMMARY:  
The Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted mandatory restrictions on religious services following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The Society celebrated this as a victory for religious freedom, as the governor replaced strict mandates with non-binding health recommendations. The Illinois Department of Health emphasized that in-person services were not encouraged, particularly for vulnerable groups, but the Society argued that the governor had overstepped by targeting religious activities during the pandemic. The Society filed three lawsuits, leading to the removal of restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services, and ultimately all mandates. Peter Breen of the Society called the outcome a "total victory" for faith communities, highlighting the importance of religious freedom in a democracy. The governor's administration stated that religious activities were always considered essential and that the updated guidelines aimed to balance safety with worship options. The decision was seen as a win for religious liberty but also raised concerns about the need for repeated litigation to secure basic rights.  
END OF SUMMARY.
