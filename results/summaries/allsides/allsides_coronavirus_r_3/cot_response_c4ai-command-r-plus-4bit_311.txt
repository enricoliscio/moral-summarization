SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois has been forced to retreat from his restrictions on religious services during the coronavirus pandemic following legal action from the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm hailed the decision as a *victory* for people of faith, with the governor removing mandates on churches and replacing them with mere recommendations. This came after the Thomas More Society filed multiple lawsuits challenging the governor's *abuse* of power and *discrimination* against religious institutions. The firm argued that the fundamental freedom of religion is *critical* to a self-governing democracy and that people of faith should be able to practice their beliefs without undue interference from the state. As a result of the lawsuits, the governor backed down and lifted all mandates, ensuring that the *basic rights* of religious groups in Illinois are respected. According to the Thomas More Society, this marks the end of a *shameful* chapter of discrimination against houses of worship in the state, and a victory for the freedom to practice one's religion safely during the pandemic.
