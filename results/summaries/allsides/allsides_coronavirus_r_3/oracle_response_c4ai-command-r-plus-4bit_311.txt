SUMMARY: The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm hailed the decision as a victory for religious freedom, stating that the governor had abused his power and stomped on the liberties of the people of Illinois. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health strongly recommends that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society filed multiple lawsuits against the governor's orders, representing several churches and their pastors. They argued that the restrictions limited religious activities and discriminated against houses of worship. As a result of the lawsuits, the governor loosened and lifted mandates against religious services, ultimately removing all restrictions on how and where people can practice their religion. The victory secured fundamental freedom of religion and ended a chapter of discrimination against religious organizations in the state. According to a spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health, the updated guidance tries to balance the desire for more worship options while keeping people safe.
END OF SUMMARY.
