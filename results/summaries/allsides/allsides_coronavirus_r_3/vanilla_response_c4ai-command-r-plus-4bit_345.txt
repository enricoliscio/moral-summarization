SUMMARY: Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services implemented during the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's orders, arguing that they violated religious liberty. In response to the lawsuits, Pritzker initially lifted restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. Ultimately, he removed all mandates on churches, replacing them with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The Thomas More Society declared this a "total and complete victory" for religious freedom in Illinois, stating that the governor had "abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people." A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health affirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential and that the updated guidance aims to balance worship options with safety measures. The firm emphasized that fundamental freedom of religion is critical in a self-governing democracy and that legal action should not have been necessary to secure these basic rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
