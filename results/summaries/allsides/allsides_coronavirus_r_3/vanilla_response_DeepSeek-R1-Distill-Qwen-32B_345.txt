Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about the Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, removing restrictions on religious services during the pandemic. This change came after lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society. They're a nonprofit law firm, and they see this as a victory. The governor had previously limited church gatherings to 10 people or more, but now those mandates are being replaced by recommendations from the health department.

I should note that the health officials still recommend remote services, especially for vulnerable groups. The Thomas More Society's VP, Peter Breen, called it a total victory for people of faith. They filed three lawsuits, and as a result, the governor lifted some restrictions, like drive-in services and outdoor gatherings. The society emphasizes the importance of religious freedom and criticizes the governor for the initial restrictions.

I also need to mention that the health department says religious activities were always considered essential and that the new guidelines aim to balance worship options with safety.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these key points: the governor's action, the reason behind it (the lawsuits), the removal of mandates, the health department's stance, the society's victory claim, the specifics of the lawsuits, and the broader implications regarding religious freedom.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all important aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
The Governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has lifted restrictions on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. Previously, churches were limited to gatherings of 10 or fewer people, but these mandates have been replaced by non-binding recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. Health officials emphasized that remote services remain strongly advised, particularly for vulnerable populations. The Thomas More Society called the change a "total victory" for religious freedom, as the governor had initially imposed strict limits on church activities. The society filed three lawsuits, leading to the removal of restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services. While the governor's administration argued religious activities were always deemed essential, the society criticized the initial restrictions as an overreach, asserting that fundamental religious freedoms are critical to democracy.
