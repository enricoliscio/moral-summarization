SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious liberty, the governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's decision marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination against houses of worship and religious leaders. The Thomas More Society hailed the announcement as a complete victory, stating that people of faith across Illinois can now breathe a little freer. The governor's administration had abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois, but has now handed a complete victory to the churches in Illinois. The updated guidance replaces mandates with recommendations, strongly advising places of worship to continue facilitating remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. This decision marks a significant loosening of restrictions, allowing people of faith to practice their religion freely. The Thomas More Society had filed three lawsuits against the governor's order, which had imposed various limits on church activities.
