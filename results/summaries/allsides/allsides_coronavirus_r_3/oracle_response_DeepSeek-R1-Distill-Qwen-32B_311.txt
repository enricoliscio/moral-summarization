Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the governor of Illinois removing restrictions on religious services after lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. They used words like "facilitate," "victory," "abused," "liberty," etc. 

I should make sure the summary includes these words. The key points are: the governor withdrew restrictions, the society called it a victory, the health department's recommendations, the society's lawsuits, and the governor's loosening of other restrictions. I need to condense this into a concise summary without losing the moral tone. 

I'll start by stating the governor's action, then mention the society's victory. Next, I'll include the health department's stance on remote services. Then, I'll note the lawsuits and the governor's loosening of other restrictions. Finally, I'll touch on the societal impact and the health department's efforts. 

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll make sure to include all the key morally framed words where appropriate. Let me draft this and then check the word count.

SUMMARY:  
The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has withdrawn mandatory restrictions on religious services during the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm declared this a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, as the governor replaced strict mandates with health department recommendations. The updated guidelines do not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activities, strongly encouraging remote services, especially for vulnerable groups. The Thomas More Society criticized Pritzker for "abusing" the pandemic to "stomp" on religious liberty, calling the removal of restrictions a win for freedom of religion. The society filed multiple lawsuits, including cases on behalf of churches seeking to lift limits on "drive-in" and outdoor services. Pritzker loosened other restrictions as a result of these legal challenges. The Illinois Department of Health stated that religious activities have always been deemed essential and that the new guidance aims to balance worship options with safety. The society emphasized that fundamental freedoms are critical to democracy and that the government's actions marked a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against religious groups. END OF SUMMARY.
