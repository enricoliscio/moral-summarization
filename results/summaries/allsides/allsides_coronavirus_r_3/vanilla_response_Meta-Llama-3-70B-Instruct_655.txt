SUMMARY:

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor announced that he would remove mandates on Illinois churches, which previously limited services to 10 people or less. The mandates will be replaced by recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health, which strongly recommend remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, stating that the governor's previous restrictions were an abuse of power and a violation of religious liberty. The firm had filed three lawsuits against the governor's order, which led to the loosening of restrictions on "drive-in" and outdoor religious services. The governor's decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders.
