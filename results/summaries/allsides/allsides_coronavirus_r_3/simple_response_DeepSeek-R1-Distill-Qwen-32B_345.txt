Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the governor of Illinois removing restrictions on religious services. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, okay, let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Governor Pritzker withdrawing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. They're a law firm, right? They're celebrating this as a victory for religious freedom. The governor had previously limited church gatherings to 10 people, but now it's just recommendations. The health department says they don't encourage in-person services, especially for vulnerable groups. 

Peter Breen from the Thomas More Society calls it a total victory for people of faith. He criticizes the governor for abusing the pandemic to infringe on religious liberty. They filed multiple lawsuits, which led to the governor lifting restrictions on drive-in and outdoor services. Now, all mandates are gone, so churches can decide how to practice their religion. 

The health department says religious activities are essential and the new guidelines balance worship options with safety. Pritzker didn't respond to comments. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angle: the fight for religious freedom, the governor's overreach, and the legal battles. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it to highlight the key points: the withdrawal of restrictions, the lawsuits, the victory for religious groups, the health department's stance, and the criticism of the governor's actions. 

Wait, should I include all the specific lawsuits? Maybe just mention that multiple lawsuits were filed, leading to the changes. Also, the health department's statement about essential activities and safety. 

Let me draft a summary that starts with the governor's action, then the lawsuits, the victory, the health department's response, and the criticism. Make sure it's clear that the author sees this as a moral victory for religious freedom against government overreach.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me put it all together in a concise manner, making sure not to exceed the word limit and preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has lifted mandatory restrictions on religious services, replacing them with non-binding health recommendations, following lawsuits filed by the Thomas More Society. The nonprofit law firm, which represents several churches, celebrated this as a victory for religious freedom, stating that the governor had "stomped on the religious liberty" of Illinois residents. The Illinois Department of Health emphasized that in-person services remain strongly discouraged, particularly for vulnerable populations, but religious activities have been deemed essential during the pandemic. The Thomas More Society criticized the governor for forcing churches to file multiple lawsuits to secure their rights, calling the situation a "shameful chapter" of discrimination. The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. END OF SUMMARY.
