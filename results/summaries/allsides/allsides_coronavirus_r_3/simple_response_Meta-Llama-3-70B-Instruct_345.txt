SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious freedom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's announcement replaces mandates on Illinois churches with recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. The Thomas More Society hailed the decision as a "total and complete victory" for people of faith, emphasizing that fundamental freedom of religion is "critical to a self-governing democracy." The society had filed three lawsuits against Pritzker's order, which had imposed limits on church activities. The governor's decision marks the end of a "shameful chapter of discrimination" against houses of worship and religious leaders. The Illinois Department of Health noted that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic. The decision is a significant win for religious liberty and a testament to the importance of protecting fundamental rights.
