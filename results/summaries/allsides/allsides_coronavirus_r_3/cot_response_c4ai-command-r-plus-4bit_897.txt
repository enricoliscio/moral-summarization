SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois has been forced to withdraw restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm hailed the decision as a *victory* for religious *freedom*, as the previous mandates will now be replaced by mere recommendations from the Illinois Department of Health. 

Peter Breen, Vice President and Senior Counsel at the Thomas More Society, called the decision a "*total and complete victory* for people of faith," emphasizing that fundamental *freedom* of religion is *critical* to a self-governing democracy. He added that the governor had *abused* his power during the COVID-19 pandemic to *discriminate* against religious institutions, calling it a "*shameful* chapter." 

The Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against the governor's orders, representing various churches and their pastors across Illinois. As a result of these legal challenges, the governor loosened restrictions not only on indoor services but also on "drive-in" and outdoor religious gatherings. 

A spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health confirmed that religious activities have always been deemed essential during the pandemic, and the updated guidance is an attempt to balance worship options with public safety.
