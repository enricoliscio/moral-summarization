Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, removing restrictions on religious services due to lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. 

Okay, the key points are: the governor withdrew the mandates that limited church gatherings to 10 people. Instead, there are now recommendations from the health department, which don't require resuming in-person services. The Thomas More Society sees this as a victory for religious freedom. They filed multiple lawsuits, and each time, the governor lifted some restrictions. For example, after one lawsuit, drive-in services were allowed, and another led to outdoor services being permitted. The health department says religious activities are essential and the new guidelines balance safety with worship options.

I should make sure to include the main actors: the governor, the Thomas More Society, and the lawsuits. Also, the impact on religious groups and the shift from mandates to recommendations. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the governor's action, then the reason (lawsuits), the response from the society, the health department's stance, and the outcome of the lawsuits leading to more freedoms.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to mention that it's a victory for religious freedom and that the governor's administration is accused of abusing the pandemic. Also, note that the health department still recommends remote services, especially for vulnerable groups.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering each point without being too detailed. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
