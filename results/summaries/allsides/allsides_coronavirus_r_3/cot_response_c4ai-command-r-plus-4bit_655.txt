SUMMARY:
The governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm. The firm hailed the decision as a *victory* for religious freedom, arguing that the previous mandates were an *abuse* of power and an act of *discrimination* against houses of worship. 

Peter Breen, Vice President and Senior Counsel of the Thomas More Society, emphasized that fundamental freedom of religion is *critical* to a self-governing democracy and that *basic* rights of religious practitioners have been infringed upon. He called the previous restrictions a "*shameful* chapter" in the state's history. 

The Thomas More Society filed multiple lawsuits against Governor J.B. Pritzker's orders, representing several churches and their pastors. As a result of these legal challenges, Pritzker has gradually loosened restrictions on religious gatherings, including those on "drive-in" and outdoor services. 

According to a spokeswoman from the Illinois Department of Health, religious activities have always been deemed *desirable* during the pandemic, and the updated guidance aims to balance worship options with public safety.
