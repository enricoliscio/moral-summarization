SUMMARY:

In a major victory for religious liberty, the governor of Illinois has withdrawn restrictions on religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, following lawsuits from the Thomas More Society. The governor's decision marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination by the government against houses of worship and religious leaders. The Thomas More Society hailed the move as a complete victory for people of faith, who can now breathe a little freer. The governor had abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois, but has now handed a complete victory to the churches. The updated guidance from the Illinois Department of Health recommends remote services, particularly for vulnerable individuals, but does not obligate or encourage in-person activity. The governor's decision comes after the Thomas More Society filed three lawsuits against his order, which had imposed various limits on church activities. The firm's efforts led to the lifting of restrictions on "drive-in" services and outdoor religious services, and ultimately, the removal of all mandates against how and where churches and people of Illinois can practice their religion.
