SUMMARY:

President Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at social media companies, threatening to shut them down if they don't stop "stifling conservative voices." This comes after Twitter fact-checked Trump's tweets about mail-in voting fraud, sparking a dispute. Trump claims that social media platforms are censoring conservative views, but Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg argues that censoring a platform would be the wrong approach. The American Civil Liberties Union says the First Amendment limits Trump's actions. Trump's threat is part of a broader conservative backlash against "Big Tech," with some lawmakers considering changes to a federal law that exempts online platforms from legal liability for user-posted content. The move raises concerns about government overreach and censorship.

END OF SUMMARY.
