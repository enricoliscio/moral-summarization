SUMMARY: President Trump is threatening to "strongly regulate" or even "close down" social media companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Apple, accusing them of "censoring" conservative voices. The dispute began when Twitter flagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that "Big Tech" is "doing everything in their power to CENSOR" in advance of the 2020 election, warning that if this continues, "we no longer have our freedom." Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg countered that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The American Civil Liberties Union argued that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. The Internet Association denied that online platforms have a political bias, saying they offer "more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history." Trump's threat is his strongest yet in a broader conservative backlash against "Big Tech," which has been accused of "violating" user privacy and engaging in anti-competitive practices. END OF SUMMARY.
