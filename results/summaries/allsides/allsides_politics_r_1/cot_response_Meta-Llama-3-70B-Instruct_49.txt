SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order on social media companies, threatening to "strongly regulate, or close them down" if they continue to "silence conservative voices". Trump accused Twitter of "stifling" his tweets about mail-in voting fraud, prompting Twitter to fact-check his posts. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that "censoring a platform" would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about "censorship". Trump's threat is his strongest yet in a broader conservative "backlash" against Big Tech, accusing them of "bias" and trying to "suppress" conservative views. The ACLU warned that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. END OF SUMMARY.
