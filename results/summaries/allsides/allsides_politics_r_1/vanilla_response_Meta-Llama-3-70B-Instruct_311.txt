SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, following his threat to shut down websites he claims stifle conservative voices. The move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting fraud with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump has accused social media platforms of censoring conservative views, saying he will "strongly regulate, or close them down" if they don't comply. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump can take. Facebook and Google have declined to comment, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell on Wednesday. The executive order is Trump's strongest threat yet in a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech.

END OF SUMMARY.
