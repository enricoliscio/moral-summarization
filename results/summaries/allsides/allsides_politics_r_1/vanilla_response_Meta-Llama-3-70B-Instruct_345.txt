SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, after accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump threatened to shut down websites, but it's unclear how he could follow through on the threat. The dispute has sparked a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling on Wednesday. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. The executive order's details are yet to be disclosed.

END OF SUMMARY.
