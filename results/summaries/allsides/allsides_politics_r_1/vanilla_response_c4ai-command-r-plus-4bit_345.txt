SUMMARY: President Donald Trump threatened to shut down social media platforms, including Twitter, over claims of conservative voices being stifled. Trump's dispute with Twitter began when the company fact-checked his tweets about unsubstantiated fraud claims in mail-in voting. In response, Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, though the specifics are unclear. This incident is part of a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, including Facebook and Google, with accusations of anti-competitive practices and user privacy violations. Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon are under antitrust investigations, and changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are being considered to hold tech companies more accountable. Republican Senator Josh Hawley questioned Twitter's legal immunity after its actions against Trump's tweets. The Internet Association denies any political bias, while tech companies defend their efforts to combat misinformation and fake accounts.
END OF SUMMARY.
