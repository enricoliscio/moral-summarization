SUMMARY:
President Trump is threatening to "strongly regulate, or close them down" social media companies, accusing them of "silencing" conservative voices. This comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that "Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election," and that if this continues, "we no longer have our freedom." The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg says censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The dispute has sparked a broader conservative "backlash" against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling. END OF SUMMARY.
