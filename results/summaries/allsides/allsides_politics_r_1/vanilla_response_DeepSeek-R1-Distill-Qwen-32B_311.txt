Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump and his actions against social media companies. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Trump is set to sign an executive order targeting social media companies. He's threatened to shut down websites that he claims are stifling conservative voices. The White House officials didn't give more details, and it's unclear how Trump can actually shut down private companies like Twitter.

Then, the dispute started when Twitter added a warning label to Trump's tweets about mail-in voting fraud, which they described as unsubstantiated. A court also upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit against Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple, which accused them of suppressing conservative views.

Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook said that censoring a platform isn't the right approach. Facebook didn't touch Trump's post about mail-in ballots. The ACLU pointed out that the First Amendment limits what Trump can do. Other companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple didn't comment.

Trump emphasized his stance, saying that social media platforms silence conservatives and that he will regulate or close them down. He also criticized Big Tech for trying to censor before the 2020 election, claiming it would take away freedom. This is the strongest threat yet in the conservative backlash against Big Tech.

Shares of Twitter and Facebook dropped. Last year, the White House had drafts of an executive order about anti-conservative bias, but it didn't gain traction. The Internet Association, including Twitter and Facebook, said platforms don't have a political bias and allow more people to be heard.

During Twitter's annual meeting, Sean Edgett explained that decisions on misinformation are made collectively. Twitter has tightened policies in recent years. Tech companies face antitrust probes and potential changes to Section 230, which could expose them to more lawsuits. Senator Josh Hawley is asking Twitter why they should keep legal immunity after editorializing on Trump's tweets.

Putting it all together, the summary should include Trump's executive order, the Twitter labeling incident, court decisions, Zuckerberg's comments, the ACLU's point, Trump's threats, the impact on shares, the past executive order drafts, the Internet Association's stance, Twitter's policy decisions, and the antitrust issues and Section 230 changes.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it by highlighting Trump's actions, the responses from social media companies, legal implications, and the broader context of the conservative backlash against Big Tech.
