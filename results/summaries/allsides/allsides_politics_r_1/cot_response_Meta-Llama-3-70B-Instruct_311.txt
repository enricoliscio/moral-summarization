SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is threatening to "strongly regulate, or close them down" social media companies, accusing them of "stifling conservative voices" and "censoring" his tweets. The dispute began when Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that "Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election," and that if this continues, "we no longer have our freedom." The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. Trump's threat is his strongest yet in a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. END OF SUMMARY.
