SUMMARY:
President Trump has threatened to shut down social media companies, including Twitter, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check. Meanwhile, a lawsuit accusing Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple of conspiring to suppress conservative views was dismissed, and Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, warned against censorship. Trump has ordered these companies to clean up their act, and Republicans are concerned about the perceived bias and silencing of conservative voices. The president's threat is the strongest yet in a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling. There are also concerns about anti-competitive practices and user privacy violations, with Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon facing antitrust probes. Lawmakers and the Justice Department are considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which could expose tech companies to more lawsuits and revoke their immunity if they choose to editorialize.
END OF SUMMARY.
