SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is threatening to "strongly regulate, or close them down" social media companies, such as Twitter and Facebook, accusing them of "stifling conservative voices" and "suppressing" conservative political views. Trump's threat comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. The President claims that "Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election," and that if this continues, "we no longer have our freedom." The move has sparked a backlash, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling, and critics arguing that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. END OF SUMMARY.
