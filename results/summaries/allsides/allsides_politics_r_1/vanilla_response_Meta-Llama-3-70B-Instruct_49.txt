SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on social media companies, following his threat to shut down websites he accuses of stifling conservative voices. The move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that social media platforms are censoring conservative voices and has threatened to regulate or shut them down. However, it is unclear how he can follow through on this threat, as the companies are privately owned. The American Civil Liberties Union says the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook and Google have declined to comment, while Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell on Wednesday following Trump's threat.

END OF SUMMARY.
