SUMMARY:

President Trump is planning to sign an executive order to regulate social media companies, threatening to shut them down if they don't comply. This comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about mail-in voting with a warning to fact-check, sparking outrage from Trump and conservative groups who claim that social media platforms are stifling conservative voices. However, experts argue that the First Amendment limits the government's ability to take action. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg also warned against censoring platforms, citing the importance of free speech. The American Civil Liberties Union and other tech companies have pushed back against Trump's threats, highlighting the importance of preserving online freedom and avoiding government overreach. Trump's actions are seen as a strong-arm tactic to silence critics and manipulate public opinion ahead of the November election.
