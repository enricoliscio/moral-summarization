SUMMARY: President Trump threatens to shut down social media companies, including Twitter, for allegedly silencing conservative voices. In response to Trump's unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting fraud, Twitter tagged his tweets with a fact-check warning, prompting the president to accuse social media platforms of censoring and stifling conservative views. The White House officials announced that Trump will sign an executive order on social media companies, but the specifics remain unclear. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, expressed his opposition to censorship by governments. Trump's threat raises concerns about freedom of speech and the potential violation of the First Amendment. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Josh Hawley questioned Twitter's legal immunity, arguing that the company editorialized the president's tweets. This dispute highlights the ongoing tension between Big Tech and conservatives, with many accusing tech companies of anti-competitive practices and user privacy violations.

END OF SUMMARY.
