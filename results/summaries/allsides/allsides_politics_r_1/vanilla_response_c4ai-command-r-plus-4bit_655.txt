SUMMARY: President Donald Trump threatened to shut down social media companies, including Twitter, accusing them of stifling conservative voices and claiming they interfere in the upcoming 2020 election. White House officials confirmed that Trump will sign an executive order on the matter on Thursday, but provided no further details. This dispute arose after Twitter fact-checked Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. In response, Trump accused social media platforms of silencing Republicans and vowed to regulate or shut them down. He also criticized Big Tech for censoring conservative political views, despite the First Amendment limitations on government action. Meanwhile, Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots untouched, and the Internet Association denied any political bias. Trump's threat raises concerns about the potential impact on free speech and the role of social media in the upcoming election. This is the strongest action yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech.
END OF SUMMARY.
