Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's actions against social media companies. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the main points: Trump is threatening to sign an executive order against social media companies, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. He even mentioned shutting them down. Twitter recently added fact-check labels to his tweets about mail-in voting fraud, which seems to have triggered his response.

The article also mentions a court case where a conservative group sued Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple, but the lawsuit was dismissed. Zuckerberg commented that government shouldn't censor platforms. The ACLU pointed out that the First Amendment limits Trump's actions. Shares of Twitter and Facebook dropped after his threat.

There's also info about past attempts to draft executive orders about anti-conservative bias, but they didn't go anywhere. The Internet Association defended these platforms, saying they don't have a political bias. Twitter's general counsel explained that decisions on fact-checking are made by a group. Tech companies are facing antitrust issues and potential changes to Section 230, which could make them liable for user content.

Putting this together, the summary should include Trump's executive order threat, the Twitter fact-checking incident, the court case dismissal, Zuckerberg's comment, the ACLU's stance, the stock reactions, past attempts, the platforms' defense, and the broader context of antitrust and Section 230 issues.

I need to condense all this into under 200 words, making sure each key point is covered succinctly. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Trump's threat, then the reasons behind it, reactions, and broader implications.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, following his accusations that platforms like Twitter are stifling conservative voices. This move comes after Twitter added fact-check labels to Trump's tweets about mail-in voting fraud. A court dismissed a lawsuit against Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple, which accused them of suppressing conservative views. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued against government censorship, while the ACLU noted First Amendment limits on Trump's actions. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell amid the controversy. Trump's threat is part of a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with past executive order drafts failing to gain traction. Platforms defend their role in allowing diverse voices, while tech companies face antitrust probes and potential changes to Section 230, which shields them from liability for user content. END OF SUMMARY.
