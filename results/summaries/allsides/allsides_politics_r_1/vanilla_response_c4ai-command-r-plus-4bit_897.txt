SUMMARY: After Twitter flagged his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting, President Donald Trump threatened to shut down social media sites for stifling conservative voices. Trump is set to sign an executive order on the matter, though it is unclear how he could legally shut down private companies like Twitter. The dispute reflects a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with accusations of anti-competitive practices and censorship. Trump's threat comes ahead of the November election, with Republicans accusing tech companies of trying to censor conservative views. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell following the dispute. The White House previously circulated drafts of a similar executive order that never gained traction. Tech companies have faced antitrust probes and criticism for violating user privacy. Changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act could expose them to more lawsuits. Republican Senator Josh Hawley questioned Twitter's legal immunity after its actions against Trump's tweets.
