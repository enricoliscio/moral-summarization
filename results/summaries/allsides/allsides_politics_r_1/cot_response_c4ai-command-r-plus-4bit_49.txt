SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has threatened to shut down social media companies, such as Twitter and Facebook, accusing them of stifling conservative voices and engaging in immoral practices. Trump's threat comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check. This dispute is part of a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with Republicans feeling that their voices are being silenced. Trump has vowed to strongly regulate or shut down these platforms to protect free speech. Meanwhile, a lawsuit accusing tech giants of conspiring to suppress conservative views was dismissed, and tech companies continue to face antitrust probes and accusations of violating user privacy. The moral framing of this issue revolves around accusations of bias, censorship, and the stifling of free speech, with Trump and conservatives arguing for stronger regulation to address these immoral practices.
