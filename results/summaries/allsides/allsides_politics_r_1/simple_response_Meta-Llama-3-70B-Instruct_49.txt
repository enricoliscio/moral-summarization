SUMMARY:

President Trump is threatening to shut down social media companies, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices and has threatened to "strongly regulate, or close them down." However, the American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg also stated that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The move is seen as a strong threat to social media companies, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling on Wednesday. The incident highlights the ongoing debate about anti-conservative bias and the role of tech companies in regulating online speech.
