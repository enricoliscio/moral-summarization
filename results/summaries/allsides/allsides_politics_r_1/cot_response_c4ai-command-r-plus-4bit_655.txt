SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has threatened to shut down social media companies, including Twitter and Facebook, accusing them of stifling conservative voices and claimed that they are conspiring to suppress conservative political views. In response, Trump stated that he would strongly regulate or shut down these platforms to protect freedom of speech. This dispute arose after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check. The president, who is a heavy user of Twitter with over 80 million followers, believes that Big Tech is trying to censor conservative voices in advance of the 2020 election. Meanwhile, a conservative group and a right-wing YouTube personality had their lawsuit against these companies dismissed, alleging a conspiracy to suppress conservative views. Trump's threat is the strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell following the news. The White House has not provided further details on how Trump plans to carry out his threat, and tech companies have denied any political bias. The American Civil Liberties Union has also stated that Trump's actions are limited by the First Amendment.
END OF SUMMARY.
