Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: censoring, silence, regulate, close, censor, freedom, violating. I have to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump threatening to shut down social media companies for stifling conservative voices, specifically after Twitter tagged his tweets about mail-in voting fraud. There's also a court case dismissed against Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple for suppressing conservative views. Zuckerberg comments on government censorship, and the ACLU mentions the First Amendment. Trump is using strong language, and the article mentions shares of Twitter and Facebook dropping. Tech companies are facing antitrust probes and possible changes to Section 230.

Now, I need to structure the summary. I'll start by mentioning Trump's executive order and his threat to shut down companies. Then, the reason behind it: Twitter tagging his tweets, which he sees as censorship. Include the court dismissing the lawsuit against the tech companies. Zuckerberg's comment on government censorship. The ACLU's point about the First Amendment. Trump's strong language about regulating or closing platforms. The impact on shares. The broader context of antitrust probes and Section 230 changes. Twitter's response about their process.

I need to make sure to use the moral words: censoring, silence, regulate, close, censor, freedom, violating. Let me check each point:

- Trump threatens to shut down (close) companies for censoring (censor) conservative voices.
- Twitter's action is seen as silencing (silence) conservatives.
- Trump wants to regulate (regulate) or close platforms.
- Zuckerberg talks about government censoring (censoring) platforms.
- ACLU mentions freedom of speech (freedom).
- Tech companies are accused of violating (violating) user privacy and antitrust laws.

I'll make sure each of these points is included with the respective moral terms. Keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but cover all key points.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with Trump's action, the reason, the court case, Zuckerberg's comment, ACLU's point, Trump's strong statements, the market reaction, and the broader issues. I'll ensure each morally framed word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: President Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, threatening to regulate or close them down for allegedly censoring conservative voices. This follows Twitter's decision to tag his tweets about unsubstantiated mail-in voting fraud with a fact-check warning. A court dismissed a lawsuit accusing Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple of conspiring to suppress conservative views. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized government censorship, while the ACLU emphasized First Amendment protections limiting Trump's actions. Trump accused Big Tech of silencing conservatives and vowed to "clean up" platforms before the election, warning of a loss of freedom. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell amid concerns over regulatory threats. Tech companies face antitrust probes and potential changes to Section 230, which could expose them to lawsuits for content moderation. END OF SUMMARY.
