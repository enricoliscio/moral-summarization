SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump has threatened to shut down social media companies, accusing them of stifling conservative voices and displaying anti-conservative bias. Trump's threat comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check. The president, a heavy Twitter user, has demanded that social media platforms "clean up their act". In response, White House officials have announced that Trump will sign an executive order on social media companies, although the details of this order are unclear. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has expressed that censoring platforms is not the right reflex for a government concerned about censorship. The American Civil Liberties Union has also stated that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Trump's threat is the strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling following the dispute. Tech companies have also been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy, with Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon facing antitrust probes. There is also discussion around modifying Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to expose tech companies to more lawsuits.
END OF SUMMARY.
