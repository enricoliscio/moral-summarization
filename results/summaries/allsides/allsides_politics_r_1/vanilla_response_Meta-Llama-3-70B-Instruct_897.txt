SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, following his threats to shut down websites he accuses of stifling conservative voices. The move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump has repeatedly claimed that social media platforms are censoring conservative views, and has threatened to "strongly regulate" or close them down. The American Civil Liberties Union has stated that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. The dispute has sparked a backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling on Wednesday. The executive order's details are unclear, but it is likely to be met with resistance from tech companies and civil liberties groups.

END OF SUMMARY.
