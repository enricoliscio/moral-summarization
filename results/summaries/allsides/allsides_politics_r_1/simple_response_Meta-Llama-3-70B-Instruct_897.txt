SUMMARY:

President Trump is threatening to shut down social media companies, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about mail-in voting with a warning to fact-check. Trump claims that Big Tech is censoring conservative views and vows to "strongly regulate, or close them down" if they don't "clean up their act." However, the American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits Trump's actions. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg also cautioned against government censorship. The dispute highlights the ongoing conservative backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling on Wednesday. The incident raises concerns about freedom of speech and the role of social media in the upcoming election. Trump's threat is seen as his strongest yet, and it remains to be seen how he will follow through on his promises.
