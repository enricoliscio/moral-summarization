SUMMARY:

President Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at social media companies, threatening to shut them down if they don't stop "stifling conservative voices". This comes after Twitter fact-checked Trump's tweets about mail-in voting fraud, prompting him to accuse the platform of censorship. The move has sparked concerns about government overreach and the erosion of free speech. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioned against censoring platforms, citing the importance of upholding the First Amendment. The ACLU also warned that Trump's actions would be unconstitutional. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate about Big Tech's role in shaping online discourse and the need for regulation. Trump's threat has already sent Twitter and Facebook shares tumbling, and raises questions about the limits of government power in regulating private companies.
