SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump has threatened to "shut down" or "strongly regulate" these companies, claiming they are "censoring" conservative views and violating user freedom. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg countered that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The American Civil Liberties Union warned that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Trump's threat is his strongest yet, sparking a broader conservative backlash against "Big Tech." Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell in response. The dispute raises concerns about freedom of speech, censorship, and the role of tech companies in regulating online content. END OF SUMMARY.
