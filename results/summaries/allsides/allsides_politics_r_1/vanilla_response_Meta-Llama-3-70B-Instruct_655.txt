SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on social media companies, threatening to shut down websites he claims stifle conservative voices. The move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump accused social media platforms of censoring conservative views and vowed to "strongly regulate, or close them down" if they don't "clean up their act." Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioned against government censorship, while the American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment limits Trump's actions. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell after Trump's threat. The executive order is the latest development in a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with lawmakers considering changes to a federal law that exempts online platforms from legal liability for user-posted content.

END OF SUMMARY.
