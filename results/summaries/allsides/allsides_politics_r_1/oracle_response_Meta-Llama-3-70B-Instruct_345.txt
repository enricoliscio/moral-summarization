SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, accusing them of "censoring" conservative voices and "silencing" their views. This comes after Twitter flagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump has threatened to "regulate" or "close down" these companies if they don't "clean up their act." He claims that "Big Tech" is trying to "censor" in advance of the 2020 election, which would be a threat to "freedom." However, the American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg also cautioned against government "censorship" of platforms. The dispute highlights concerns about "violating" user privacy and anti-competitive practices in the tech industry. Republican lawmakers are considering changes to a federal law that exempts online platforms from legal liability for user-posted content, which could expose them to more lawsuits.

END OF SUMMARY.
