SUMMARY: President Donald Trump threatened to shut down social media companies, including Twitter, accusing them of stifling conservative voices and claiming they interfere with the upcoming 2020 election. This dispute arose after Twitter fact-checked Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. Trump plans to sign an executive order regarding social media companies, though the specifics are unclear. The move has sparked a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley criticizing Twitter for editorializing on the President's tweets. Meanwhile, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that censorship is not the right approach for a government concerned about censorship. Tech companies are already under scrutiny for anti-competitive practices and privacy violations, with antitrust investigations underway. The White House's previous attempts to address anti-conservative bias through an executive order have not gained traction. The Internet Association denies political bias, emphasizing the platforms' role in amplifying diverse voices. Twitter's General Counsel Sean Edgett defended the decision to fact-check Trump's tweets, citing the company's policies on misinformation.
END OF SUMMARY.
