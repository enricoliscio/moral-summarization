SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump is threatening to "strongly regulate, or close them down" social media companies, accusing them of "stifling conservative voices" and "censoring" his tweets. Trump's threat comes after Twitter tagged his tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that "censoring a platform would not be the 'right reflex'" for a government worried about censorship. Trump claims that "Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election," and that if this happens, "we no longer have our freedom." The Internet Association denies any political bias, saying online platforms offer "more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history." END OF SUMMARY.
