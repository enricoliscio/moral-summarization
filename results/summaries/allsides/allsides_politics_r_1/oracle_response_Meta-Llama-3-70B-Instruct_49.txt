SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order targeting social media companies, accusing them of "censoring" conservative voices. The move comes after Twitter flagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting him to threaten to "shut down" the platform. Trump claims that "Big Tech" is trying to "silence" conservatives and vowed to "regulate" or "close" them down if they don't "clean up their act." Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioned against government "censorship," while the ACLU argued that the First Amendment limits Trump's actions. The dispute is part of a broader conservative backlash against tech companies, with some accusing them of "violating" user privacy and engaging in anti-competitive practices. Shares of Twitter and Facebook fell in response to Trump's threats, which are seen as his strongest yet.

END OF SUMMARY.
