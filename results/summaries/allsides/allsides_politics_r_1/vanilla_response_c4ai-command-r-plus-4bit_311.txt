SUMMARY: President Donald Trump threatened to shut down social media companies, including Twitter, accusing them of stifling conservative voices. This came after Twitter fact-checked Trump's unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting fraud. Trump is expected to sign an executive order on social media companies, though the specifics are unclear. Legal experts and companies like Facebook and Google questioned the feasibility of Trump's threat, citing First Amendment protections and private company ownership. Trump's move is seen as an attempt to appeal to his conservative base ahead of the November election. The dispute reflects a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with concerns about anti-competitive practices and user privacy violations. Tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon are already facing antitrust probes. Lawmakers and the Justice Department are also considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which could expose tech companies to increased legal liability.
END OF SUMMARY.
