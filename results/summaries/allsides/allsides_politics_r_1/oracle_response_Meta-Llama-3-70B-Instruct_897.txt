SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at social media companies, threatening to "shut down" or "censor" them if they don't "clean up their act" and stop "silencing" conservative voices. This move comes after Twitter tagged Trump's tweets about mail-in voting with a warning, prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump claims that "Big Tech" is "doing everything in their power to CENSOR" in advance of the 2020 election, and that if this continues, "we no longer have our freedom." The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the First Amendment limits any action Trump could take. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that censoring a platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government worried about censorship. The move is seen as Trump's strongest threat yet in a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech, with shares of Twitter and Facebook falling as a result. END OF SUMMARY.
