SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown set off a wave of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained prominence and is winning. Americans are increasingly recognizing the systemic racism and unfair treatment that Black people face in police encounters and other aspects of society. Recent surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more Americans acknowledging racism as a big problem. The media is also paying more attention to police shootings, with the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking these incidents in the absence of credible federal data. This reflects a rise in public interest, and prosecutors are taking the issue more seriously, with several cops charged and indicted for high-profile killings. Lawmakers are also pushing for accountability, with calls for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While the battle is not over, with Republicans and white Americans remaining skeptical, the trend is apparent: Black Lives Matter is making significant strides in addressing the systemic pattern of anti-black law enforcement violence in the US.
