SUMMARY:

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is making progress. Americans are becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing a shift in public opinion. More people are recognizing that black people are unfairly treated in society, including in police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with several cases resulting in charges against officers. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning.
