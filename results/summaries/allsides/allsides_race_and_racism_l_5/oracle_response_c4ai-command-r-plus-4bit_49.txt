SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system and the Democratic presidential candidates are being pressured to take a stance on the issue. While Black people are still dying at the hands of police, there have been some recent victories. Surveys show that Americans are increasingly recognizing the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and racism as a "big problem" in society. The media is also playing a role by tracking police shootings and bringing attention to the issue. Prosecutors are taking police wrongdoing more seriously, and charges have been filed in several high-profile cases. Lawmakers are also pushing for accountability, with calls for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making a difference and their message is being heard. END OF SUMMARY.
