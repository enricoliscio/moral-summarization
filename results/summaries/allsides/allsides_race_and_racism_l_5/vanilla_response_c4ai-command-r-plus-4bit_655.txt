SUMMARY: One year after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant momentum and is achieving notable successes in raising awareness and addressing systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. Public opinion surveys show increased recognition of racial biases, with Americans acknowledging the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and a growing perception of racism as a significant societal problem. The media has also intensified its focus on police shootings, with prominent news outlets establishing databases to track these incidents. Prosecutors are increasingly taking action against police officers involved in unjustified shootings, and lawmakers are advocating for measures such as body cameras and improved tracking of police killings. While challenges remain, with Republican candidates and white Americans expressing skepticism about the extent of racism, there is a clear shift towards greater recognition of racial injustices and a push for accountability in policing. The Black Lives Matter movement is making tangible progress, and its impact on the American political landscape is undeniable. END OF SUMMARY.
