SUMMARY:

A year after the Ferguson protests, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining ground. Americans are increasingly acknowledging systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with recent surveys showing a shift in public opinion. More people believe black people are unfairly treated in society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, filing charges against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement still faces challenges, but its impact is undeniable.
