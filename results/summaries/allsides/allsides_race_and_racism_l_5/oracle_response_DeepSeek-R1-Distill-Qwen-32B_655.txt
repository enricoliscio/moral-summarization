Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the Black Lives Matter movement and specified that I need to summarize it while preserving the moral framing the author used. They also listed specific morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The movement has increased awareness about systemic racism, influenced political candidates, and led to more police being charged for killings. However, the issue isn't resolved yet, as black people still face high rates of police violence.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "shooting," "racism," "charged," "killings," "dying," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to highlight the progress made, such as increased awareness, media attention, and legal actions against officers. But also mention that the fight isn't over, as systemic issues persist. I need to balance the positive developments with the ongoing challenges.

I'll start by stating that Black Lives Matter is winning, then mention the increased attention to systemic racism. I'll include the impact on political candidates and the legal actions taken against officers. I'll note the surveys showing higher awareness and the media's role in tracking police shootings. Then, I'll mention the prosecutors taking the issue seriously and the calls for accountability. Finally, I'll acknowledge that while progress is happening, the fight isn't over yet.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the key morally charged words without forcing them in. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft this and then review to make sure all the important points and moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Americans are increasingly recognizing unfair treatment of black people, with recent surveys showing a record-high percentage calling racism a "big problem." Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, reflecting heightened public interest. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose's killing in Cincinnati, where a prosecutor called the shooting "unwarranted" and "senseless." Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have advocated for police accountability measures like body cameras. While progress is evident, Black Lives Matter's fight against anti-black violence is far from over, as racial skepticism persists among Republicans and white Americans. Despite challenges, the movement is winning, with the political system slowly reflecting this shift. END OF SUMMARY.
