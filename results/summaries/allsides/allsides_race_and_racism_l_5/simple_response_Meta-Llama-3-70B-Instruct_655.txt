SUMMARY:

The Black Lives Matter movement has made significant progress in the past year, with Americans becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Surveys show that more people acknowledge unfair treatment of black people in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, filing charges against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability measures such as body cameras. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement's efforts have led to a shift in public opinion and a growing recognition of the need for change.
