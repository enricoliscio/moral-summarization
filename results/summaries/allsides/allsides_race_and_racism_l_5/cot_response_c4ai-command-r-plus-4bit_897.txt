SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown sparked a wave of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has been winning. Americans are increasingly recognizing systemic racism in the criminal justice system and police encounters, with Democratic presidential candidates facing pressure to take a stand on the issue. While Black people continue to face alarming rates of police violence, there have been some successes. Several prosecutors have filed charges against officers involved in high-profile killings, and lawmakers are pushing for greater police accountability. The media is also paying more attention to the issue, tracking police shootings and highlighting the public interest. Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical, but the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making a real difference in the fight against systemic anti-black law enforcement violence.
