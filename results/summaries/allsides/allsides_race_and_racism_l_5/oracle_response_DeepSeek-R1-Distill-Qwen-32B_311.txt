Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The movement has increased awareness about systemic racism, led to more police being charged, and influenced public opinion and media coverage. However, there's still a long way to go.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, so words like "shooting," "racism," "charged," "killings," "dying," "horrifying," etc., should be included. I'll structure the summary to show progress but also remaining challenges.

I'll start by mentioning Michael Brown and the movement's rise. Then, note the increased attention to systemic racism and the political and legal responses. Include the surveys showing more awareness. Mention the media's role in tracking shootings. Highlight the prosecutors taking action and the push for accountability. Finally, acknowledge that while progress is made, the fight isn't over.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key moral points are covered without losing the essence.

SUMMARY:  
A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Americans are increasingly recognizing unfair treatment of black people, as shown by recent Gallup and Pew surveys. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, reflecting heightened public interest. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, with charges filed in cases like Samuel DuBose's killing in Cincinnati. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have called for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police violence. While progress is evident, challenges remain: black people still face alarming rates of police violence, and skepticism about racism persists among Republicans and white Americans. Despite this, Black Lives Matter is winning, as the movement's impact on public discourse and policy is undeniable. END OF SUMMARY.
