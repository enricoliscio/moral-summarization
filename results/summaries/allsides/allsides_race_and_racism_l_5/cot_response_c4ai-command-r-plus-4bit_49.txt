SUMMARY: The Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant traction in the year following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Americans are increasingly recognizing the issue of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with Democratic presidential candidates being pressured to take a stand on the issue. While Black individuals continue to face alarming rates of police violence, there have been notable victories. Several cops have been charged and indicted for high-profile killings, and the media is paying more attention to the issue, with major outlets tracking police shootings in the absence of credible federal data. Prosecutors, who hold the power to charge police wrongdoing, are taking a stronger stance, and lawmakers are pushing for greater police accountability. The movement is facing skepticism, particularly from Republicans and white Americans, but it is clear that Black Lives Matter is making significant strides in addressing systemic anti-black law enforcement violence in the US.
