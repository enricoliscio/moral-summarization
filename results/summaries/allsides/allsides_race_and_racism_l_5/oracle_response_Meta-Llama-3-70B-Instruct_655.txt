SUMMARY:

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Despite ongoing systemic racism in the criminal justice system, Americans are paying more attention to the issue, with surveys showing a 20-year high in recognizing racism as a "big problem" in society. The media is also taking notice, with databases tracking police shootings and public interest in the issue rising. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with charges being filed against officers accused of wrongdoing. Lawmakers, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the American political system is slowly but surely responding to the issue of systemic racism and police violence.
