Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The author uses specific morally charged words like "shooting," "racism," "charged," "killings," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions that Black Lives Matter is gaining traction, more people are aware of systemic racism, and there's increased scrutiny on police actions. The movement hasn't ended police violence, but there's progress in public perception and legal actions against officers.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by highlighting the movement's progress, mention the increased attention to systemic racism, the role of media tracking police shootings, and the legal actions taken against officers. I should also note that while progress is made, challenges remain, especially with skepticism from some groups.

I'll make sure to use the moral words like "charged," "indicted," "killings," "shooting," etc., to maintain the author's framing. Also, I should end with the conclusion that Black Lives Matter is winning, even if the fight isn't over yet.

Let me structure this: start with the movement's progress, mention public awareness, media's role, legal actions, mention that the fight isn't over, and conclude with the movement's success despite ongoing issues. Keep it concise and include as many moral words as possible without making it too wordy.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the key points and moral language. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides. Americans are increasingly aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with more people acknowledging unfair treatment of black individuals by police. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, highlighting the lack of federal data. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, with several officers charged or indicted for killings like Samuel DuBose's in Cincinnati. Lawmakers, including Obama and Clinton, are pushing for accountability measures like body cameras. While Black Lives Matter hasn't ended police violence against black people, the movement is winning as public awareness and legal scrutiny grow. However, skepticism remains among some groups, and the fight continues. END OF SUMMARY.
