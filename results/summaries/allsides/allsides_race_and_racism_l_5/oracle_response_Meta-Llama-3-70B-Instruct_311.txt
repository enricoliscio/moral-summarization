SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, and Democratic presidential candidates are being held accountable for their stance on the issue. While black people are still dying at alarming rates at the hands of police, recent surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more Americans acknowledging that black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society. The media is also taking the issue more seriously, tracking police shootings and holding officers accountable for their wrongdoing. Prosecutors are filing charges against officers accused of wrongdoing, and lawmakers are pushing for police reform, including the use of body cameras. While there is still much work to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the American political system is slowly but surely taking notice. END OF SUMMARY.
