SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system and the Democratic presidential candidates are being pressured to take a stance on the issue. While Black people are still dying at the hands of police, recent surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more Americans recognizing the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and racism as a "big problem" in society. The media is also paying more attention, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking the issue more seriously, with several officers being charged and indicted for high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are calling for police to wear body cameras and improve tracking of police killings. While there is still work to be done, especially among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and change is happening. END OF SUMMARY.
