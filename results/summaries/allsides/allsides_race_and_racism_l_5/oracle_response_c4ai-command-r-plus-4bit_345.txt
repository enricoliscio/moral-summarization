SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system and the Democratic presidential candidates are being pressured to take a stance on the issue. While Black people are still dying at the hands of police, there have been some positive changes. Surveys show an increased awareness of racism and unfair treatment of Black people in US society. The media is also paying more attention, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings and killings. Prosecutors are taking the issue more seriously, with several officers being charged and indicted for their wrongdoing. Lawmakers are calling for police to wear body cameras and improve tracking of police killings. While there is still work to be done, especially among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making a difference and winning the battle against anti-black law enforcement violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
