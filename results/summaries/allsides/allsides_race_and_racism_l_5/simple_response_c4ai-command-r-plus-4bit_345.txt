SUMMARY: A year on from the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining ground in the fight against systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. While Black people are still facing alarming rates of police violence, public opinion is shifting, with growing recognition of the unfair treatment of Black individuals in police encounters. Media coverage and public interest in police shootings have increased, and prosecutors are increasingly willing to take action against police officers accused of wrongdoing. Political leaders, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have also advocated for measures to hold police accountable and improve tracking of police killings. Despite resistance from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making tangible progress in addressing systemic anti-black law enforcement violence. END OF SUMMARY.
