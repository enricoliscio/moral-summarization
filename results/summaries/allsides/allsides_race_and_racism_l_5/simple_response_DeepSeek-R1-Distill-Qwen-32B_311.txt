Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the article is about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The author seems to be highlighting the progress made but also acknowledges that the fight isn't over yet.

First, I should identify the key points. The movement has increased awareness about systemic racism, influenced political candidates, and led to more prosecutions of police officers. The media is paying more attention, and public opinion has shifted. However, there are still challenges, like skepticism from some groups and ongoing issues with police violence.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the successes and the remaining challenges without losing the moral perspective. The author frames this as a movement that's making progress but hasn't yet succeeded. So the summary should reflect that balance.

Let me start by mentioning the anniversary and the movement's rise. Then, highlight the increased attention to systemic racism, the impact on politicians and media, and the shift in public opinion. Also, note the progress in prosecutions but emphasize that the struggle continues with ongoing issues and political resistance.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, so I need to be selective. Maybe structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point: awareness, political impact, media role, public opinion shift, progress in accountability, and ongoing challenges.

I need to make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”acknowledging progress but not declaring victory, highlighting both the successes and the remaining obstacles. That way, the summary stays true to the author's perspective.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public attention to racial injustice has grown, with more Americans recognizing racism as a major societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, compensating for the lack of federal data. Prosecutors, including Republicans, are increasingly holding officers accountable for excessive force, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose and Walter Scott. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, have advocated for police accountability measures like body cameras. However, the fight is far from over: Black people continue to die at alarming rates, and skepticism about racism persists among Republicans and some white Americans. While progress is evident, the struggle for justice remains ongoing. END OF SUMMARY.
