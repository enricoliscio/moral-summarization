SUMMARY: A year after the shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the US. Public opinion surveys show increased concern about racial injustice, and the media is paying more attention to police shootings. Prosecutors and lawmakers are also taking action, with charges being brought against officers involved in high-profile killings and calls for improved tracking of police killings and the use of body cameras. While there is still much to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the American political system is slowly reflecting this change. END OF SUMMARY.
