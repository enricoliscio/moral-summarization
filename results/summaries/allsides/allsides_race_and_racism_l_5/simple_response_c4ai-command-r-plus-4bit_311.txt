SUMMARY: A year on from the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is achieving success in raising awareness and instigating change. While Black people continue to die at the hands of police, there is increasing recognition of systemic racism in the criminal justice system and police shootings are being taken more seriously. Surveys show Americans are more likely to acknowledge the unfair treatment of Black people in society, and the media is paying more attention to the issue. Prosecutors are also taking a stronger stance, with charges being filed against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are calling for reforms such as body cameras for police officers and improved tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making significant progress in its fight against anti-Black law enforcement violence.
