SUMMARY:

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Despite ongoing racism in the criminal justice system, Americans are paying more attention to the issue, with surveys showing a 20-year high in recognizing racism as a "big problem" in society. The media is also taking notice, with databases tracking police shootings and public interest in the issue on the rise. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with charges filed against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the American political system is slowly responding to the need to address systemic racism and police violence. The movement's mission to "redress the systemic pattern of anti-black law enforcement violence" is gaining traction. END OF SUMMARY.
