Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's death. I need to make sure I capture the progress made but also the ongoing issues. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions increased awareness of systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media attention, and legal actions against officers. But it also notes that racism is still a big issue, especially among some groups.

I need to structure the summary to show both the progress and the remaining challenges. Start with the movement's impact, then mention the surveys and media efforts. Highlight the legal and political responses, but also point out the lingering skepticism and resistance, especially from Republicans.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Use clear and direct language to convey the moral aspects, like the shift in public opinion and the accountability efforts, but also the continued struggles.

Let me outline the key points: increased attention to systemic racism, public opinion shifts, media databases, prosecutor actions, political initiatives, and remaining challenges. I'll weave these into a coherent summary, ensuring each point is briefly touched upon without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the conclusion that Black Lives Matter is making progress but the fight isn't over yet. This maintains the moral framing by emphasizing the ongoing struggle against systemic issues.

SUMMARY:  
A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public opinion has shifted, with more Americans acknowledging unfair treatment of Black people and identifying racism as a major societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, filling the gap left by federal data. Prosecutors, including Republicans, are increasingly holding officers accountable for excessive use of force, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose's killing in Cincinnati. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, have pushed for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police violence. However, systemic issues persist, with Black people still dying disproportionately at the hands of police. While progress is evident, skepticism about racism remains high among Republicans and white Americans, and criminal justice reform remains a polarizing issue. Black Lives Matter's fight continues, but the movement's impact is undeniable.  
END OF SUMMARY.
