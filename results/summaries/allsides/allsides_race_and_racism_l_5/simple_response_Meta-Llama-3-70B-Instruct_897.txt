SUMMARY:

The Black Lives Matter movement is gaining momentum, with Americans becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system. A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, surveys show that more Americans believe black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, filing charges against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the movement's efforts are leading to a shift in public opinion and policy.
