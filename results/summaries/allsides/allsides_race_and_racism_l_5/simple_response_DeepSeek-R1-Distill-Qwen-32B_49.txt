Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article talks about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. It mentions increased awareness about systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media attention, and actions from prosecutors and lawmakers. The movement hasn't fully succeeded yet, but there's progress. I should highlight both the progress and the remaining challenges. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral perspective of the original text.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public opinion has shifted, with more Americans recognizing racial unfairness and racism as major societal issues. Media attention has increased, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, with several high-profile cases leading to charges against officers. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have called for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While progress is evident, challenges remain, as many Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical of racism's impact. Despite this, the movement's influence is undeniable, signaling a growing recognition of racial injustice in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
