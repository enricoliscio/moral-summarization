SUMMARY:

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Despite ongoing racism in the criminal justice system, Americans are paying more attention to the issue, with surveys showing a shift in public opinion. More people are acknowledging that black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The media is also taking the issue more seriously, with databases tracking police shootings and more interest in the topic. Prosecutors are taking a stronger stance, charging and indicting police officers for wrongdoing, and lawmakers are pushing for accountability. While there is still much work to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement is redressing the systemic pattern of anti-black law enforcement violence in the US, and it's happening.
