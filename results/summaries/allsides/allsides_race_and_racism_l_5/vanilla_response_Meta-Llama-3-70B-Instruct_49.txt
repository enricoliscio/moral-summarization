SUMMARY:

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining momentum. Americans are becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with recent surveys showing a significant increase in the number of people who believe black people are unfairly treated by police. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings and increased public interest in the issue. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with several high-profile cases resulting in charges against officers. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability measures such as body cameras. While there is still skepticism among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement's efforts are leading to increased awareness and action on police brutality and systemic racism.
