SUMMARY: 

A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Despite ongoing police killings, the movement has brought attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Democratic presidential candidates are being held accountable for their stance on the issue, and cops are being charged and indicted for high-profile killings. Recent surveys show a shift in public opinion, with Americans recognizing that black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, tracking police shootings and highlighting the need for accountability. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, calling them "unwarranted" and "senseless". Lawmakers are pushing for police to wear body cameras and for better tracking of police killings. While there is still much work to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the American political system is slowly taking notice.
