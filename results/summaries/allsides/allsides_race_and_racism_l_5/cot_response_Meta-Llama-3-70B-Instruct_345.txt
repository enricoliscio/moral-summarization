SUMMARY:
A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. The movement has brought attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, and Americans are now more likely to acknowledge that black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society, including police encounters. Recent surveys show a 20-year high in the percentage of Americans calling racism a "big problem" in society. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with many calling out "unwarranted" and "senseless" killings. Lawmakers, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, including the use of body cameras. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the notoriously slow American political system is finally starting to reflect this shift.
