SUMMARY: A year on from the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining ground and achieving results in the fight against systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. While Black people are still facing alarming rates of police violence, public opinion is shifting, with growing recognition of the unfair treatment of Black individuals in police encounters and broader society. The media is also playing a role, with increased coverage and tracking of police shootings, while prosecutors are increasingly willing to take on cases of police wrongdoing. Political leaders are also responding, with calls for improved tracking of police killings and the adoption of body cameras for police officers. Although Republicans and white Americans remain more skeptical of the issue, the Black Lives Matter movement is making tangible progress in addressing systemic racism and holding police accountable for their actions.
