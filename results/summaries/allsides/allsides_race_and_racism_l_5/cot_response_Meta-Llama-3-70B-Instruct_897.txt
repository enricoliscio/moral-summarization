SUMMARY:
A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with a 20-year high in the percentage of Americans calling racism a "big problem" in society. The movement has led to increased scrutiny of police shootings, with prosecutors taking a stronger stance against police wrongdoing. Lawmakers, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, including the use of body cameras. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical about the threat of racism, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and Americans are recognizing the need to address systemic racism and police violence.
