SUMMARY:

A year after the Ferguson protests, the Black Lives Matter movement is making progress. Americans are becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing a shift in public opinion. Democratic presidential candidates are being held accountable for their stance on the issue, and cops are being charged and indicted for high-profile killings. While black people are still dying at alarming rates, recent surveys show a 20-year high in Americans calling racism a "big problem‚Äù in society. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking the issue more seriously, filing charges against officers involved in police shootings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning.
