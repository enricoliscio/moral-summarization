Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Black Lives Matter movement. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the article mentions that a year after Michael Brown's shooting, the movement has made progress. I'll note that systemic racism is getting more attention. Then, it talks about how Democratic candidates are affected by their stances, and cops are being charged more. I should include that while there's progress, issues still exist, like Samuel DuBose's case.

Next, the surveys from Gallup and Pew show increased awareness of unfair treatment and racism. The media's role is important too, with databases tracking police shootings. I'll mention the rise in public interest and Google search trends.

Prosecutors taking action is a key point. I'll list the cases where charges were filed. Lawmakers like Obama and Clinton are pushing for reforms, such as body cameras and better tracking of police killings.

However, the movement isn't fully successful yet. Republicans and white Americans are still skeptical, and most GOP candidates avoid the issue. I'll end by noting that while progress is slow, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making an impact.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is concise. Let me structure it to flow from the movement's impact, public awareness, media and prosecutor actions, legislative steps, and the remaining challenges. That should cover all essential aspects without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
A year after Michael Brown's police shooting in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant traction, raising awareness about systemic racism in the criminal justice system. While progress is evident—such as increased public acknowledgment of racial injustice and prosecutors charging officers in high-profile cases like Samuel DuBose's killing—the movement's ultimate goal of ending anti-black violence remains unfulfilled. Surveys show more Americans recognize racism as a major societal issue, and media outlets are tracking police shootings more closely. Prosecutors, including Republicans, are taking firmer stances against police misconduct, and lawmakers like Obama and Clinton are advocating for reforms, such as body cameras and better data tracking. However, skepticism persists among Republicans and white Americans, and GOP candidates largely avoid the issue. Despite challenges, the movement's influence is undeniable, signaling a shift in societal attitudes.  
END OF SUMMARY.
