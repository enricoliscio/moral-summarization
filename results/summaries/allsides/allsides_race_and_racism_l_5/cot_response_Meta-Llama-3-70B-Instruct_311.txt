SUMMARY:
A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with a growing number of people acknowledging that black people are unfairly treated in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The movement's efforts have led to cops being charged and indicted for high-profile killings, and lawmakers are pushing to hold police accountable. While black people are still dying at alarming rates at the hands of police, recent surveys show a shift in public opinion, with a 20-year high in the percentage of Americans calling racism a "big problem" in society. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with some even calling them "horrifying" and "unnecessary". The trend is apparent: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the notoriously slow American political system may take a while to reflect that, but it's really happening.
