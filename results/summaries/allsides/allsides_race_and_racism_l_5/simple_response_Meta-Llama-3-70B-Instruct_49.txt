SUMMARY:

The Black Lives Matter movement has made significant progress in the past year, with Americans becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more people acknowledging that black people are unfairly treated in society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, filing charges against officers involved in high-profile killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement's efforts are leading to a necessary reckoning with racism in the US, and although there is still much work to be done, progress is being made.
