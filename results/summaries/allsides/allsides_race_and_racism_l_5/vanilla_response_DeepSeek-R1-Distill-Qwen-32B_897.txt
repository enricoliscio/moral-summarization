Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Black Lives Matter movement. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the movement's progress a year after Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson. It mentions increased awareness of systemic racism, changes in public opinion, and actions from the media and prosecutors.

Hmm, I should highlight the key points: more Americans acknowledging racism, media tracking police shootings, and prosecutors taking police accountability more seriously. Also, mention the push for policy changes like body cameras and better data tracking. But I shouldn't forget that the fight isn't over yet, as racism still exists, especially among some groups.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the movement's impact, mention public opinion shifts, media's role, prosecutorial actions, policy pushes, and conclude that while progress is made, the battle continues.

Okay, let me put it all together in a clear, concise summary without getting too bogged down in details. Make sure it flows well and covers all the main points.

SUMMARY:  
A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides. Americans are increasingly aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing higher recognition of unfair treatment of Black people and racism as a major societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, filling the gap left by federal data. Prosecutors are taking police accountability more seriously, charging officers involved in high-profile killings, such as Samuel DuBose in Cincinnati. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have pushed for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While progress is evident, challenges remain, as racism persists and skepticism among Republicans and white Americans continues. Despite this, the movement's impact is undeniable, signaling a shift in how police violence is addressed in the U.S.
