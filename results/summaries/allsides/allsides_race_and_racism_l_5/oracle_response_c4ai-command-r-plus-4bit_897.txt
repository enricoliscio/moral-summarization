SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system and the democratic process, and there have been charges and indictments for high-profile killings by cops. Surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more Americans recognizing the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and the persistence of racism as a "big problem." The media is also tracking police shootings, reflecting a rise in public interest. Prosecutors and lawmakers are taking action, with charges being filed and calls for increased accountability, such as body cameras for police officers. While the battle is not over, with Black people still dying at the hands of police, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making significant strides towards redressing systemic anti-Black law enforcement violence in the US.
END OF SUMMARY.
