Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Black Lives Matter movement. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that a year after Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained momentum. It highlights increased awareness about systemic racism in the criminal justice system. I should note that more Americans are recognizing unfair treatment of black people, as shown by recent surveys from Gallup and Pew. The media is also paying more attention, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings.

The article mentions that while the movement hasn't completely succeeded, there have been significant changes. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, leading to charges against officers involved in high-profile cases like Samuel DuBose, Walter Scott, Eric Harris, and Freddie Gray. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, are pushing for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police killings.

However, the article also points out that there's still skepticism among Republicans and white Americans, and Republican candidates aren't addressing criminal justice issues much. Despite this, the trend shows that Black Lives Matter is making progress, even if the political system is slow to change.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: increased awareness, media attention, prosecutorial actions, political initiatives, and the ongoing challenges. I'll make sure to highlight both the progress and the remaining issues.
