Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Black Lives Matter movement and its impact. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words, then write a summary preserving those moral terms. 

First, I'll read through the article to spot words that carry moral weight. Words like "protests," "systemic racism," "unfairly treated," "big problem," "unwarranted," "senseless," "asinine," "accountable," "redress," "anti-black," "violence," "skeptical," "reflect," and "happening." These words convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary. I need to include these moral terms while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the movement's impact a year after Michael Brown's shooting. Then, I'll note the increased awareness and political shifts, like the surveys showing more people recognizing racism. I'll mention the media's role in tracking police shootings and the prosecutors taking action. Also, I'll include the push for accountability from lawmakers, but note that the fight isn't over yet. Finally, I'll conclude that while progress is slow, the movement is making an impact.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too wordy. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I'll make sure to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words appropriately.

**SUMMARY:**

A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained momentum, highlighting systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Public awareness of racial inequality has grown, with surveys showing increased recognition of unfair treatment of black people and racism as a significant societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, reflecting heightened public interest. Prosecutors are increasingly holding officers accountable, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose and Walter Scott. Lawmakers, including Obama and Clinton, are pushing for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While progress is evident, skepticism remains among Republicans and white Americans. Despite challenges, the movement is making strides, signaling a shift in how police violence is addressed.
