Alright, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I need to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. It highlights increased awareness of systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media attention, and actions from prosecutors and politicians. The movement hasn't completely succeeded, but there's progress.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angleâ€”emphasizing the struggle against systemic racism and the movement's victories. I should include key points like the shift in public perception, media databases tracking police shootings, prosecutors taking action, and political responses. Also, mention that while progress is made, challenges remain, especially with some political reluctance.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it: start with the movement's impact, mention public opinion, media, legal actions, political moves, and conclude with the ongoing struggle.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring all these elements are included without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public opinion has shifted, with more Americans recognizing unfair treatment of black people and identifying racism as a major societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, addressing the lack of federal data. Prosecutors are increasingly holding officers accountable, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose and Walter Scott. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, are pushing for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police violence. While progress is evident, challenges remain, with some Republicans and white Americans remaining skeptical. Despite this, the movement's impact is undeniable, signaling a growing recognition of racial injustice in America. END OF SUMMARY.
