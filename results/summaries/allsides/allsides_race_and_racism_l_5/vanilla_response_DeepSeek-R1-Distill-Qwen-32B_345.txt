Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer. They provided an article about the Black Lives Matter movement and its impact a year after Michael Brown's shooting. My task is to summarize this article concisely, within 200 words, and format it with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It talks about how the Black Lives Matter movement has gained traction, leading to increased awareness of systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media attention, and legal actions against officers involved in shootings. The article also mentions that while progress is being made, challenges remain, especially with some political resistance.

I should identify the key elements: the movement's impact, changes in public perception, media's role, legal actions, political responses, and the ongoing challenges. I need to condense these into a coherent summary without losing the essence.

I'll start by mentioning the anniversary of Michael Brown's shooting and the rise of Black Lives Matter. Then, highlight the increased awareness and public surveys showing more people recognizing racial issues. Next, note the media's role in tracking police shootings. Then, discuss the legal actions taken against officers and the political push for accountability, including body cameras and tracking data. Finally, acknowledge the ongoing challenges and skepticism, but conclude that the movement is making progress despite obstacles.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows logically. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's concise and covers all the main points without unnecessary details.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include all these elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained momentum, increasing awareness of systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public surveys show more Americans recognize racial disparities, with a June Gallup poll finding increased concern about unfair treatment of Black people. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, reflecting heightened public interest. Prosecutors are also taking police misconduct more seriously, with several high-profile cases leading to charges against officers. Politicians, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have pushed for police accountability measures like body cameras. While challenges remain, with skepticism persisting among some Republicans and white Americans, the movement's impact is evident, signaling progress toward addressing racial injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
