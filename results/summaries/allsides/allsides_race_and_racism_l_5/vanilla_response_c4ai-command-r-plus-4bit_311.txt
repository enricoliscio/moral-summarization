SUMMARY: One year after the shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant momentum and is achieving important victories in the fight against systemic racism and police brutality. Public opinion surveys show a shift in Americans' perceptions of racial injustice, with increasing recognition of the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and other aspects of society. The media has also played a role by tracking police shootings and bringing greater attention to the issue. Prosecutors and lawmakers are taking action, with charges being filed against officers involved in high-profile killings and calls for improved tracking of police killings and the use of body cameras. While there is still much work to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making tangible progress in addressing systemic racism and holding police accountable for their actions.
