SUMMARY:
The Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant momentum in the year following Michael Brown's shooting, which sparked protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Americans are increasingly acknowledging the systemic racism in the criminal justice system, particularly regarding police encounters with Black individuals. Surveys reveal a growing perception of racism as a "big problem" and unfair treatment of Black people. 

The media and prosecutors are also taking note, with databases tracking police shootings and more public condemnations of unwarranted shootings by law enforcement. Prosecutors have filed charges and indictments against officers involved in high-profile killings, and lawmakers are pushing for accountability measures such as body cameras for police officers. 

While there is still skepticism and avoidance of the issue among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making tangible progress in its mission to address systemic anti-Black law enforcement violence in the US. The movement is winning, and while the American political system may lag, change is undoubtedly happening. END OF SUMMARY.
