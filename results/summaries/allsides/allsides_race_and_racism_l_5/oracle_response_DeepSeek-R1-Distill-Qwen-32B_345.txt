Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I have to include as many as possible in the summary without making it longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The movement has increased awareness about systemic racism in the criminal justice system. There's been more attention from the media, public, and even some political action, like charging officers for killings. However, the situation isn't resolved yet, as black people still face high rates of police violence. 

I need to make sure I include words like "shooting," "racism," "charged," "killings," "dying," etc. I should structure the summary to show progress but also acknowledge that the fight isn't over. I'll mention the media's role, public opinion shifts, prosecutorial actions, and political responses. I should end by noting that while progress is happening, the battle continues.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral words. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides. Americans are increasingly aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing higher recognition of unfair treatment of black people and racism as a major societal issue. Media attention has grown, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, as seen in cases like Samuel DuBose's killing in Cincinnati, where charges were filed against officers. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, have advocated for police accountability measures like body cameras. While progress is evident, black people still face alarming rates of police violence, and skepticism about racism persists among Republicans and white Americans. Despite this, the movement's impact is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, though the fight continues. END OF SUMMARY.
