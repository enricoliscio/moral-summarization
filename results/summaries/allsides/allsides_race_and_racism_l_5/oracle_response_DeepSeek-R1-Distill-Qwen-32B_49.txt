Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. The movement has increased awareness about systemic racism and police violence.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used, like "shooting," "racism," "charged," "killings," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

The key points to include are: increased attention to systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media tracking police shootings, prosecutors taking action, and political responses like body cameras. Also, note that while progress is made, the fight isn't over.

I'll structure the summary to highlight these points, using the moral words. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence captures a main point and uses the appropriate terminology. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained momentum, drawing attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Americans are increasingly recognizing unfair treatment of black people, with surveys showing a rise in awareness of racism as a societal issue. Media outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian now track police shootings, highlighting the lack of federal data. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, charging officers involved in high-profile killings, such as Samuel DuBose and Walter Scott. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have called for police accountability measures like body cameras. While progress is evident, racism remains a contentious issue, particularly among Republicans and white Americans. Despite challenges, the movement is winning, with growing recognition of the need to address systemic violence and injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
