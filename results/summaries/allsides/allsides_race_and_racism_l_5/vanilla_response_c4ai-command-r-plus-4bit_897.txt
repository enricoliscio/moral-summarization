SUMMARY: One year after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained significant momentum and is achieving notable victories in raising awareness and sparking action to address systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. Public opinion surveys show increased recognition of racial biases, with more Americans acknowledging that Black people are unfairly treated by police and in other aspects of society. The media is also paying closer attention, with major outlets tracking police shootings and coverage of police brutality receiving heightened public interest. Prosecutors and lawmakers are taking steps towards accountability, with charges being brought against officers involved in high-profile killings and calls for improved data tracking and increased use of body cameras. While there is still much work to be done, with Black individuals continuing to face disproportionate harm at the hands of police, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making tangible progress in its fight for justice and systemic change.
