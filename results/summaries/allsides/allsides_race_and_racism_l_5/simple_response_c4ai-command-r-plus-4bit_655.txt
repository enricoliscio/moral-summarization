SUMMARY: A year on from the police shooting of Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. While Black people are still dying at the hands of police at alarming rates, there have been notable victories in the fight against systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Americans are paying more attention to the issue, with surveys showing increased recognition of the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and other aspects of society. The media is also taking the issue more seriously, with major outlets tracking police shootings and public interest in the issue remaining high. Prosecutors and lawmakers are also taking steps to hold police accountable, with charges being filed against officers in several high-profile cases and calls for improved tracking of police killings and the use of body cameras. While there is still much to be done, especially among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is making significant progress in its fight for justice and accountability.
