SUMMARY:

The Black Lives Matter movement has made significant progress in the past year, with Americans becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Surveys show a shift in public opinion, with more people recognizing unfair treatment of black people in all aspects of society, including police encounters. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings and increased coverage of the issue. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, filing charges against officers accused of wrongdoing. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability measures such as body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still work to be done, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement's efforts have led to a growing recognition of the problem and a desire for change.
