Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article talks about the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement a year after Michael Brown's shooting. It mentions increased awareness about systemic racism, changes in public opinion, media attention, and actions from prosecutors and lawmakers. The movement hasn't fully succeeded yet, but there are signs of progress.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the shift in public opinion and the accountability measures. I should highlight the progress without downplaying the ongoing issues. I'll structure the summary to first mention the movement's progress, then the challenges, followed by the evidence of change, and conclude with the ongoing struggle. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include key points like the surveys, media databases, prosecutor actions, and political responses. I should also note that while there's progress, there's still resistance from some groups.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements and end with the conclusion that the movement is making strides despite remaining challenges.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides in raising awareness about systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system. Public opinion has shifted, with more Americans recognizing unfair treatment of Black people and identifying racism as a major societal issue. Media attention has increased, with outlets like the Washington Post and the Guardian tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are also taking police misconduct more seriously, with several high-profile cases leading to charges against officers. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, have pushed for reforms like body cameras and better tracking of police violence. However, challenges remain: Black people continue to die at alarming rates, and many Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical of racism's impact. Despite this, the movement's influence is undeniable, signaling a growing recognition of the need for change. END OF SUMMARY.
