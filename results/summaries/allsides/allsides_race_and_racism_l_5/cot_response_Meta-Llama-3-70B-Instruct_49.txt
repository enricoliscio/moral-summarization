SUMMARY:
A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are finally acknowledging the systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing a 20-year high in recognizing racism as a "big problem" in society. The media is paying more attention, tracking police shootings and highlighting the alarming rates of black people dying at the hands of police. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with many calling out "unwarranted" and "senseless" killings. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, calling for body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and the notoriously slow American political system is slowly reflecting this shift.
