SUMMARY: A year on from the police shooting of Michael Brown, which sparked protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining ground and creating positive change. While Black people are still facing alarming rates of police violence, there has been a significant shift in public opinion and media coverage, with Americans recognizing the systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Surveys show an increased awareness of the unfair treatment of Black individuals in police encounters and a growing perception of racism as a significant problem in society. The media is also playing a more active role, with outlets like The Washington Post and The Guardian tracking police shootings independently due to the lack of reliable federal data. Prosecutors are taking a stronger stance against police brutality, and lawmakers are pushing for greater police accountability. While there is still resistance from Republicans and some segments of the population, the Black Lives Matter movement is making tangible progress in addressing systemic racism and police violence in the US.
