SUMMARY: A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown, which sparked a wave of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained prominence and is winning important victories in the fight against systemic racism and anti-Black violence in the US criminal justice system. Americans are increasingly recognizing the unfair treatment of Black people in police encounters and other aspects of society, with surveys showing a shift in public opinion. Media outlets are also paying more attention, tracking police shootings and highlighting the lack of credible federal data. Prosecutors are taking action, with charges being filed against officers in several high-profile killings, and lawmakers are pushing for measures to hold police accountable. While there is still skepticism and avoidance of the issue among Republicans and white Americans, the trend is apparent: Black Lives Matter is making significant strides in addressing the systemic pattern of anti-black law enforcement violence and winning the battle for public awareness and accountability.
