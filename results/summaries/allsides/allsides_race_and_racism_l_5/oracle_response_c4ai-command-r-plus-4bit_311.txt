SUMMARY: One year after the shooting of Michael Brown sparked protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is making significant strides in addressing systemic racism in the US criminal justice system. While Black people continue to be killed by police at alarming rates, public awareness and media attention have increased, with surveys indicating a growing recognition of racism as a "big problem." Prosecutors and lawmakers are taking action, with charges and indictments brought against officers in several high-profile cases. The movement is gaining traction, with increasing calls for police accountability and efforts to track police killings. While there is still resistance from Republicans and white Americans, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and change is happening, even if slowly. END OF SUMMARY.
