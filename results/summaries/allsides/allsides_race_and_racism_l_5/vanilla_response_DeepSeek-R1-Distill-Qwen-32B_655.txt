Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Black Lives Matter movement. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how a year after Michael Brown's shooting, the movement has made significant progress. People are more aware of systemic racism, especially in the criminal justice system. 

I should note the key points: increased awareness, more charges against officers, media attention, and political responses. Also, the surveys showing more Americans recognize racism as a big issue. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll mention the progress but also that the fight isn't over, as black people still face high rates of police violence. Highlight the media's role, like the Washington Post and Guardian tracking shootings. 

Also, include the political actions, like body cameras and tracking police killings by Obama. But note that not everyone is on board, especially Republicans. 

I should structure it to show progress despite ongoing issues. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me piece it together, ensuring each main point is covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: A year after Michael Brown's police shooting sparked protests in Ferguson, the Black Lives Matter movement has made significant strides. Americans are increasingly aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing higher recognition of unfair treatment of Black people and racism as a major societal issue. Media attention has grown, with outlets like the Washington Post and Guardian tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police misconduct more seriously, charging officers in several high-profile cases. Politicians, including Obama and Clinton, have pushed for accountability measures like body cameras and better tracking of police violence. While progress is evident, challenges remain, as Black people still face disproportionately high rates of police violence, and some political leaders remain skeptical. The movement's impact is clear, though full victory is yet to be achieved. END OF SUMMARY.
