SUMMARY:
A year after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement is winning. Americans are paying more attention to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing a 20-year high in the percentage of Americans calling racism a "big problem" in society. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with some even calling them "unwarranted" and "senseless". Lawmakers, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability, including the use of body cameras. While Republicans and white Americans remain skeptical about the threat of racism, the trend is clear: Black Lives Matter is winning, and Americans are finally acknowledging the "horrifying" and "unnecessary" police killings of black people.
