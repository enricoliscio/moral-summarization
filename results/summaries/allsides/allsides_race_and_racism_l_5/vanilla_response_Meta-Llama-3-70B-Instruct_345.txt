SUMMARY:

A year after the Ferguson protests, the Black Lives Matter movement is gaining ground. Americans are becoming more aware of systemic racism in the criminal justice system, with surveys showing a significant increase in people acknowledging unfair treatment of black people. The media is also paying more attention, with databases tracking police shootings and public interest in the issue rising. Prosecutors are taking police shootings more seriously, with several high-profile cases resulting in charges against officers. Lawmakers, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, are pushing for police accountability measures such as body cameras and better tracking of police killings. While there is still skepticism among Republicans and white Americans, the trend suggests that Black Lives Matter is winning. The movement's mission to address anti-black law enforcement violence is far from over, but progress is being made.
