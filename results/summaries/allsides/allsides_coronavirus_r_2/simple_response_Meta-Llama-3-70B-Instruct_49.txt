SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling notes the hypocrisy of allowing thousands of protesters to gather while enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly, including religious gatherings. The judge stated that this preferential treatment amounts to "freedom for me, but not for thee." The decision is seen as an important step towards preventing the exercise of absolute monarchy under the pretext of public health. The Thomas More Society, which represented the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as a win for religious freedom and a blow against hypocrisy.

END OF SUMMARY.
