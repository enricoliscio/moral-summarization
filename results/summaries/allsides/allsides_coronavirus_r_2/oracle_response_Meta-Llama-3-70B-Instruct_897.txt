SUMMARY:

In a significant win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, prohibiting them from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge's decision curtailed the officials' arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing a lack of compelling justification. The ruling effectively states that the officials cannot impose any limitation on outdoor gatherings and cannot impose limitations on indoor gatherings that are out-of-step with the state's reopening plan. The judge noted the hypocrisy of the officials, who "sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment" while continuing to ban high school graduations and other outdoor gatherings exceeding 25 people. The decision is seen as an important step towards inhibiting the emerging trend of exercising absolute monarchy on the pretext of public health. The ruling highlights the injustice of the officials' decisions, which meant "freedom for me, but not for thee." END OF SUMMARY.
