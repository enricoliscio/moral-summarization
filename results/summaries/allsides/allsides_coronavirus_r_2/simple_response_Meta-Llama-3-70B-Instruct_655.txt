SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling notes that the officials' "preferential treatment" of protests, allowing thousands to gather without enforcement, while limiting other forms of public assembly, including religious gatherings, is hypocritical. The judge stated that the officials could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment. The ruling is seen as an important step towards preventing the abuse of power under the pretext of public health. As one lawyer noted, the decision highlights the double standard of "freedom for me, but not for thee."
