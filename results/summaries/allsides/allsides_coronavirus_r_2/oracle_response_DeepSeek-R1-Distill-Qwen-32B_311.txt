Okay, so I'm trying to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific task, so I need to make sure I follow it accurately. First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio, who were limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while supporting protests.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. They listed a bunch of words like "ruled," "limit," "supporting," etc. I need to make sure these words are included without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the judge's ruling, the comparison between religious gatherings and protests, the hypocrisy pointed out, and the implications of the decision. I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the ruling, then the specifics of the injunction, the hypocrisy, and the impact on religious groups.

I also need to use the morally charged words effectively. For example, "ruled" and "hypocrisy" are strong terms that convey the judgment and unfairness. I should mention the preferential treatment of protests over religious gatherings, highlighting the unfairness in the policies.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented in the article. The summary should be concise but cover all the main points, ensuring that the moral framing is clear and preserved as per the user's request.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within 200 words and that the moral elements are prominent.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio were wrong to limit religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo, his attorney general, and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, noting that they allowed mass protests while continuing to ban outdoor gatherings of more than 25 people. Sharpe argued that the preferential treatment for protests amounted to a double standard, as Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health reasons but instead encouraged them. The ruling highlights the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification, emphasizing the need to balance public health measures with religious freedom. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, welcomed the decision, calling it an important step toward inhibiting the exercise of absolute authority under the guise of public health. The judge's ruling underscores the moral inconsistency in enforcing restrictions on religious gatherings while allowing mass protests, raising concerns about the arbitrary use of power. END OF SUMMARY.
