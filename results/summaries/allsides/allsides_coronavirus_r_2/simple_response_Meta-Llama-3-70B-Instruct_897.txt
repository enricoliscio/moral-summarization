SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling notes the hypocrisy of allowing thousands of protesters to gather while enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly, including religious gatherings. The judge stated that the officials could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment. This decision is seen as an important step towards preventing the abuse of power under the pretext of public health, where freedom is granted to some but not others. The ruling effectively prohibits the officials from imposing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, ensuring that religious freedom is protected.
