Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio. The judge found that the restrictions on religious gatherings were unfair compared to the support given to protests. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "hypocrisy," "preferential treatment," "curtailment," "fundamental rights," "sham," "absolute monarchy," and "double standard" come to mind. These words are used to convey the moral judgment against the governor and mayor's actions.

Next, I have to summarize the article. I should make sure to include these moral terms to maintain the original framing. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the judge's ruling, mention the hypocrisy in handling protests versus religious gatherings, and note the organizations involved. I'll also highlight the judge's points about the double standard and the impact on religious freedom.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the ruling, the comparison between protests and religious gatherings, the judge's reasoning, and the implications. I'll keep each sentence clear and direct, making sure to include the key moral points without adding extra information.

Let me put it all together. The summary should reflect that the judge found Cuomo and de Blasio's actions hypocritical, favoring protests over religious gatherings, and that this ruling is a step towards curbing authoritarianism. I'll make sure to include the essential details without going over the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, criticizing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio for hypocrisy in handling religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Cuomo and de Blasio supported mass protests against racial injustice, they imposed strict limits on religious gatherings, including a 25% occupancy cap. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting arbitrary limits on church gatherings and highlighting the "preferential treatment" given to protests over other assemblies. The judge noted that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health reasons but instead encouraged them, sending a message of unequal treatment. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was a "sham" and that the officials were exercising "absolute monarchy" under the guise of public health. The ruling is seen as a step toward curbing such authoritarian trends and ensuring equal treatment for all forms of public assembly.
