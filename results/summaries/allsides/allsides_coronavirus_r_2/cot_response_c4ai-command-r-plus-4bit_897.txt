SUMMARY: A federal judge's ruling supports religious freedom advocates by declaring that New York's Governor Cuomo and New York City's Mayor de Blasio are wrong to restrict religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while endorsing mass protests against racial injustice. Judge Sharpe's decision defends religious freedom as a fundamental right, arguing that the arbitrary limitations on indoor and outdoor religious gatherings are an unjustified curtailment of freedom. The ruling highlights the hypocrisy of Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, who openly supported the mass protests while restricting other forms of assembly. The preferential treatment given to protesters is seen as an exercise of absolute power under the pretext of public health, curtailing the freedom of religion in favor of "preferential treatment" for certain causes. The decision is a victory for those who value religious freedom, sending a clear message that such fundamental rights cannot be arbitrarily limited without compelling justification. END OF SUMMARY.
