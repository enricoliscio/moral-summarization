Alright, so I need to help this user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio, who were limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while supporting protests. The judge issued an injunction, pointing out the hypocrisy of preferential treatment.

I need to identify the key elements: the ruling, the individuals involved, the actions taken (limiting religious gatherings, supporting protests), the judge's reasoning about curtailment of rights, the hypocrisy, and the impact on religious groups.

Now, I'll make sure to include the morally charged words like "ruled," "limit," "supporting," "injustice," "issued," "injunction," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the judge's decision, the hypocrisy, and the implications for religious freedom.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive. I'll start with the ruling, mention the individuals, explain the double standard, and conclude with the significance of the decision.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate without making the summary too lengthy.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials' decisions to curtail religious gatherings without compelling justification were unconstitutional. The order prohibits arbitrary limits on church gatherings, aligning indoor gatherings with New York's reopening plan, which grants "essential" businesses full occupancy and "nonessential" businesses 50%, but religious gatherings were capped at 25%. The judge highlighted the hypocrisy of preferential treatment for protests, noting that Cuomo and de Blasio encouraged mass gatherings for protests while enforcing restrictions on other assemblies. The ruling underscores the curtailment of fundamental rights and the need to inhibit the exercise of absolute power under the guise of public health. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was disregarded for protests, while restrictions on religious gatherings persisted. The decision aims to address the double standard and ensure equal treatment under the law. END OF SUMMARY.
