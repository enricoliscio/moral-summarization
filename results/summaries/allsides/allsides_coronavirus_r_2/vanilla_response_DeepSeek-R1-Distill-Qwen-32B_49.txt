Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a court ruling in New York regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic. 

First, the main points: A federal judge ruled against Cuomo and de Blasio, saying they can't limit religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, stopping them from enforcing arbitrary limits on churches. He criticized the officials for not justifying the restrictions on religious rights. 

The ruling mentions that outdoor gatherings can't be limited, and indoor ones must follow the reopening plan's phases. Under that plan, religious groups were only allowed 25% occupancy, which the judge found unfair. The Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm, represented the plaintiffs, who were Catholic priests and Jewish congregants.

The article also talks about the hypocrisy of the officials supporting protests but limiting other gatherings. The judge pointed out the double standard, calling it preferential treatment. The protests were allowed despite social distancing rules, while other events like graduations were banned.

So, the key elements to include in the summary are: the court ruling, the injunction against Cuomo and de Blasio, the criticism of their double standard, the specifics of the reopening plan affecting religious groups, and the mention of the Thomas More Society representing the plaintiffs. Also, the hypocrisy in allowing protests but not other gatherings is an important point.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: start with the ruling, then the judge's injunction, the criticism, the specifics of the plan, the hypocrisy, and the impact of the decision.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to mention the judge's name and the officials involved. Also, note that the ruling supports religious freedom and highlights the inconsistency in public health measures.

Let me put it all together now, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.
