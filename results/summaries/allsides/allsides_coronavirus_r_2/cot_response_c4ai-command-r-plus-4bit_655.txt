SUMMARY: A federal judge's ruling prohibited New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests, arguing that their actions amounted to "preferential treatment" and "hypocrisy." The ruling stated that the officials' encouragement of protests while discouraging other gatherings was a "flagrant disregard" of social distancing rules and sent a clear message that "protests are deserving of preferential treatment." The injunction prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on religious gatherings, effectively stating that they cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and must follow the reopening plan for indoor gatherings. The decision was praised as a win for religious freedom advocates, who argued that the previous limitations on gatherings were a sham and a curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. It also highlights the hypocrisy and double standards applied to different types of gatherings, with protests being given preferential treatment over religious and other public assemblies.
