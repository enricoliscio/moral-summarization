SUMMARY: A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom, striking down the decision of New York's governor and mayor to limit religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. The judge, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe, argued that the actions of the governor and mayor, Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio, resulted in the "curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification." The decision prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings and grants religious gatherings the same occupancy rights as "essential" businesses. The ruling highlights the hypocrisy of the officials' actions, who encouraged mass protests while enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly. The judge noted that the officials' support for the protests amounted to "preferential treatment," and that they could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead chose to curtail the freedom of religion. This decision is a victory for those who value religious freedom and believe that all forms of assembly should be treated equally under the law. 

END OF SUMMARY.
