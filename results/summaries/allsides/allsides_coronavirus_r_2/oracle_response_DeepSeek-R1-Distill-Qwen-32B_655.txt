Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio. The judge issued a preliminary injunction stopping them from limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while supporting protests. The judge criticized the officials for not justifying the curtailment of fundamental rights.

I should note the key points: the ruling, the injunction, the hypocrisy of supporting protests but limiting religious gatherings, and the preferential treatment mentioned. Also, the judge's reasoning about the officials' decisions and the impact on religious groups.

Now, I need to use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "ruled," "limit," "supporting," "injustice," "issued," "injunction," "prohibiting," "curtailment," "hypocrisy," "treatment," etc.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the judge's ruling and injunction, then the hypocrisy of supporting protests but limiting religious gatherings. I'll include the judge's criticism about the lack of justification and the preferential treatment. Also, mention the Thomas More Society's perspective on Cuomo's protocol being a sham and the impact on religious groups.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise while covering all the moral points. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included with the appropriate moral language.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, issuing a preliminary injunction against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, prohibiting them from arbitrarily limiting religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, as they supported mass protests while enforcing restrictions on religious assemblies. The ruling highlighted the "preferential treatment" given to protests, arguing that Cuomo and de Blasio failed to justify the curtailment of fundamental rights. The judge noted that while the officials could have discouraged protests for public health, they instead encouraged them, sending a message of unequal treatment. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, called Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" a sham, emphasizing that religious groups faced bans on gatherings while protests were allowed. The decision aims to inhibit the trend of absolute authority under public health pretenses, ensuring equal treatment for all. END OF SUMMARY.
