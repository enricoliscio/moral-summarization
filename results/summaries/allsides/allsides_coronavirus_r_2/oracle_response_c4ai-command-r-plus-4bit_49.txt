SUMMARY: In a ruling that supports religious freedom, a federal judge issued an injunction prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while at the same time encouraging mass protests. The decision states that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limitations on outdoor gatherings and must follow the state's reopening plan for indoor gatherings. The ruling argues that the preferential treatment of protests over religious gatherings amounts to hypocrisy and a curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. It inhibits the exercise of absolute monarchy on the pretext of public health and COVID-19 restrictions. The decision comes after thousands of protesters flocked to the streets of New York following the death of George Floyd, with no pushback from the aforementioned officials. Instead, Cuomo and de Blasio openly spoke in support of the protests while continuing to enforce limitations on other forms of public assembly, such as high school graduations and other outdoor gatherings. The judge's ruling sends a clear message that religious freedom deserves the same treatment as mass protests.
