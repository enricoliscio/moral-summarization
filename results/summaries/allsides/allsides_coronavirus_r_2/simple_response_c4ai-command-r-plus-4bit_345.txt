SUMMARY: Religious freedom advocates won a victory when a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for unfairly restricting religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, arguing that the officials' actions curtailed fundamental rights without justification. He noted the hypocrisy in enforcing limitations on religious gatherings while openly supporting mass protests, granting preferential treatment to protesters over religious groups. The decision prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from imposing arbitrary limits on outdoor gatherings and indoor gatherings beyond the limits specified in New York's reopening plan. The ruling highlights the importance of preserving religious freedom and equal treatment under the law, even in times of crisis. It serves as a reminder that public officials must respect the constitutional rights of all citizens and not arbitrarily favor certain groups over others.

END OF SUMMARY.
