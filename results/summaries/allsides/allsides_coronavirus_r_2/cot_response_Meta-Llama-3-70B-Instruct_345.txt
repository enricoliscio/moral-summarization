SUMMARY:
A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were wrong to limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge's decision prohibits the officials from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing a lack of compelling justification. The ruling highlights the hypocrisy of the officials, who applied a double standard by allowing mass protests to proceed while restricting other forms of public assembly. The judge argued that this preferential treatment amounts to a sham, exercising absolute monarchy on the pretext of public health. The decision is a win for freedom, inhibiting the emerging trend of absolute power. END OF SUMMARY.
