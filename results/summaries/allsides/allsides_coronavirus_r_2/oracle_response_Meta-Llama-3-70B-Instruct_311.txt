SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge's decision is a win against the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling exposes the hypocrisy of the officials, who enforced limitations on other forms of public assembly while encouraging mass protests, sending a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment. The judge argued that the officials could have discouraged protests or exercised discretion to suspend enforcement for public safety reasons, but instead, they acted to inhibit the exercise of religious freedom. The decision is an important step towards inhibiting the emerging trend of exercising absolute monarchy on pretext of public health, where freedom is granted to some but not to others.
