Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio's pandemic restrictions. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the judge ruled against Cuomo and de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. The judge issued an injunction, prohibiting arbitrary limits on church gatherings. He criticized the officials for not justifying the restrictions on religious groups when they supported protests. 

The author's moral framing is about hypocrisy and inconsistency in applying public health measures. They argue that religious groups were unfairly treated compared to protesters. I need to highlight the judge's criticism of the double standard and the comparison made by Ferrara about Cuomo's policies.

I should also mention the specific details, like the 25% occupancy rule for religious gatherings versus the support for protests. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

I'll structure the summary by starting with the judge's ruling, then the details of the injunction, the hypocrisy point, and the comparison made by Ferrara. I'll make sure to include that the judge pointed out the preferential treatment for protests over religious gatherings, emphasizing the moral issue of inconsistency in enforcing public health measures.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit, while capturing the moral argument presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, criticizing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio for imposing arbitrary limits on religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while allowing mass protests. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing restrictions on church gatherings that were not aligned with the state's reopening plan. Sharpe criticized the officials for failing to provide a compelling justification for limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests, calling it a double standard. The judge noted that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health reasons but instead supported them, sending a message of preferential treatment. The ruling highlights the hypocrisy of enforcing restrictions on religious groups while allowing large protests, emphasizing the importance of equal treatment under the law. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's policies prioritized certain groups over others, undermining the principle of equal rights. END OF SUMMARY.
