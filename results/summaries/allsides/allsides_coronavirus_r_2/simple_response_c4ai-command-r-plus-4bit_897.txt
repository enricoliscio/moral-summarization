SUMMARY: Religious freedom advocates achieved a victory when a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for their unfair treatment of religious gatherings compared to the mass protests that occurred following the death of George Floyd. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the arbitrary limitation on church gatherings, stating that fundamental rights should not be curtailed without a compelling justification. The decision highlights the hypocrisy of Cuomo and de Blasio, who supported and encouraged mass protests while still enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly. The ruling argues that their actions amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters and that public health concerns should not be used as a pretext for restricting freedom of assembly. The decision sends a strong message against the arbitrary exercise of power and the curtailment of fundamental rights, including freedom of religion and assembly.
