SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic while supporting mass protests. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limits on church gatherings without compelling justification. The ruling notes that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights, and that they showed preferential treatment to protesters by not enforcing social distancing rules during mass protests. The judge's decision effectively allows religious gatherings to operate at the same capacity as "essential" and "nonessential" businesses, with 100% and 50% occupancy respectively. The ruling is seen as a win for religious freedom advocates, who argued that the officials' actions were hypocritical and unconstitutional.
