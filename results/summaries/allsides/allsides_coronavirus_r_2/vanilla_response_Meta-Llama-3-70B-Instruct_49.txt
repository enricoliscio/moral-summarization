SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. The ruling comes after Cuomo and de Blasio supported mass protests for racial injustice while limiting religious gatherings. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, noted that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The order states that New York officials cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and cannot impose limitations on indoor gatherings that are out-of-step with the state's reopening plan. The ruling is seen as a win for religious freedom advocates, who argued that the officials' actions amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters. The judge's decision is an important step towards preventing the exercise of absolute monarchy on the pretext of public health.
