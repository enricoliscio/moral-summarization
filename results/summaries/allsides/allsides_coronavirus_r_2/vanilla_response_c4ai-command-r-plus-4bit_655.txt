SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cannot limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests. The judge's decision states that the officials cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and must follow the same occupancy rules for indoor religious gatherings as for "essential" businesses. The ruling was in response to a complaint filed by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants who argued that their religious freedom was being curtailed while mass protests were allowed to take place. The judge pointed out the hypocrisy of the officials' actions, arguing that they gave "preferential treatment" to the protesters. The Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm, represented the religious groups and argued that the officials' actions were an abuse of power and a curtailment of fundamental rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
