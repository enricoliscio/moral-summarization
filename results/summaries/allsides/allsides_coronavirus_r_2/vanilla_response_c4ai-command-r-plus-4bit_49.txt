SUMMARY: In a ruling that favored religious freedom advocates, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The injunction prohibits them from enforcing arbitrary limits on religious gatherings while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. Judge Sharpe noted that the New York officials' double standard amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters and that their decisions curtailed fundamental rights without a compelling justification. The ruling effectively prevents the officials from imposing limitations on outdoor gatherings and restricts them from imposing stricter limits on indoor religious gatherings compared to businesses. The case was brought forward by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants represented by the Thomas More Society, who argued that the officials' support for mass protests while restricting religious gatherings was hypocritical and infringed on their fundamental rights. The ruling highlights the tension between public health concerns and the protection of fundamental freedoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
