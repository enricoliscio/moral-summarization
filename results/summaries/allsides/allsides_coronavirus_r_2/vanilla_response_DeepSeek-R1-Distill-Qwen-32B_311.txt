Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a federal judge's ruling regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic in New York. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued an injunction against Cuomo and de Blasio. He found that their policies unfairly limited religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. 

I should note the key points: the judge's ruling, the comparison between religious gatherings and protests, the specifics of the injunction, and the reaction from the Thomas More Society. Also, the hypocrisy in the officials' actions is a main theme.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main details without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention that religious gatherings were limited to 25% occupancy while protests were allowed, and how the judge saw this as preferential treatment.

I should structure the summary to first state the ruling, then explain the reasoning, and finally mention the reactions and implications. That should cover all the essential points concisely.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unfairly limited religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while allowing mass protests for racial justice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The judge criticized the officials for applying a double standard, allowing thousands of protesters to gather without enforcing social distancing rules while restricting religious groups to 25% occupancy under the state's reopening plan. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was selectively enforced, favoring protests over other gatherings. The ruling highlights the hypocrisy of preferential treatment for protests, emphasizing that public health measures should not target specific groups. END OF SUMMARY.
