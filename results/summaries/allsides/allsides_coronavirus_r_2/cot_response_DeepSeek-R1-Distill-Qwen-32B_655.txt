Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio. The judge issued an injunction against limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while supporting mass protests. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, pointing out that they allowed large protests but restricted religious gatherings. The Thomas More Society, a conservative group, represented the plaintiffs and highlighted the preferential treatment for protests over other gatherings.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

Words like "hypocrisy," "preferential treatment," "curtailment," "fundamental rights," "absolute monarchy," "sham," "double standard," "injustice," "ban," "discrimination," "freedom," "discrimination," "discrimination" again. Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through each paragraph.

In the first paragraph: "win for religious freedom," "wrong to limit," "curtailment of fundamental rights," "compelling justification." So "wrong," "curtailment," "fundamental," "compelling."

Second paragraph: "sham," "save lives," "absolute monarchy," "pretext of public health," "freedom for me, but not for thee." So "sham," "save," "absolute," "pretext," "freedom."

Third paragraph: "hypocrisy," "double standard," "preferential treatment," "flagrant disregard," "public safety reasons," "silent," "clear message," "deserving of preferential treatment." So "hypocrisy," "double standard," "preferential," "flagrant," "public safety," "silent," "deserving."

Fourth paragraph: "interviewed," but that's not moral. So I think I've got all the morally framed words.

Now, for the summary, I need to preserve as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: the judge's ruling, the hypocrisy in treating protests differently, the moral arguments about fundamental rights and preferential treatment.

I should structure it by stating the ruling, the judge's reasoning about hypocrisy, the groups involved, and the implications of the decision regarding religious freedom and public health justifications.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words identified. I'll need to be concise but include key points like the injunction, hypocrisy, preferential treatment, fundamental rights, and the contrast between protests and religious gatherings.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

**Summary:**

A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, issuing an injunction against New York Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while allowing mass protests. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, noting their "preferential treatment" of protests over religious gatherings. The ruling highlighted the "curtailment of fundamental rights" without "compelling justification," emphasizing the "double standard" in enforcing public health measures. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was a "sham," as protests were permitted despite "flagrant disregard" of social distancing rules. The judge pointed out that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health but instead supported them, sending a message of "preferential treatment." The decision underscores the moral implications of "absolute monarchy" under public health pretenses, advocating for "freedom for all" rather than selective enforcement.
