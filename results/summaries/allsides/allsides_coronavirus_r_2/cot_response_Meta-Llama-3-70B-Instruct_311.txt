SUMMARY:
A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the "curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification." The ruling highlights the "hypocrisy" and "preferential treatment" given to protesters, who were allowed to gather in large numbers without enforcement of social distancing rules. In contrast, religious gatherings were confined to 25% occupancy, while "essential" businesses were granted 100% occupancy. The judge's decision is seen as an important step towards preventing the "absolute monarchy" of government officials who exercise power under the "pretext" of public health. The ruling upholds the value of "freedom" and rejects the notion of "freedom for me, but not for thee."
