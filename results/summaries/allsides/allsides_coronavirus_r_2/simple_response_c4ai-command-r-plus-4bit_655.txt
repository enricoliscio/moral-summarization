SUMMARY: A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, arguing that New York's Governor Cuomo and New York City's Mayor de Blasio are wrong to restrict religious gatherings while allowing mass protests of racial injustice to continue. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limits on church gatherings and cannot favor protests over religious gatherings. The decision comes after thousands of protesters were allowed to gather in New York without pushback from the officials, while religious gatherings were still confined to 25% occupancy. The Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm, represented a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants who brought the complaint, arguing that the officials' actions amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters over religious groups. Judge Sharpe's ruling prohibits the arbitrary enforcement of mass gathering limitations and supports the equal treatment of religious gatherings and protests under the law.
