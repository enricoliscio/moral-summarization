SUMMARY:
In a significant win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were wrong to limit religious gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from ordering or enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing "preferential treatment" for protesters. The judge noted that the officials could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead sent a clear message that mass protests are "deserving of preferential treatment." The decision is seen as an important step toward inhibiting the emerging trend of exercising "absolute monarchy" on the pretext of public health. The ruling effectively states that the New York officials cannot impose limitations on indoor gatherings that are out-of-step with the state's reopening plan.
END OF SUMMARY.
