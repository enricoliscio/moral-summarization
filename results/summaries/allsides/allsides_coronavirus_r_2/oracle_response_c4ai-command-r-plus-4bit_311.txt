SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who limited religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting arbitrary limits on church gatherings, stating that decisions curtailing fundamental rights without compelling justification are wrong. The order prevents the officials from imposing limitations on outdoor gatherings and restricts indoor gatherings to the same occupancy levels as "essential" and "nonessential" businesses. The decision highlights the preferential treatment given to protesters, with the judge arguing that the officials encouraged and supported the protests while enforcing restrictions on other forms of assembly. The ruling sends a clear message against the double standard and supports religious freedom.

END OF SUMMARY.
