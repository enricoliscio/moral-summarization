SUMMARY:

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has prohibited New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic, citing hypocrisy and preferential treatment towards mass protests. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, arguing that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The judge noted that while the officials supported mass protests, they continued to ban high school graduations and other outdoor gatherings exceeding 25 people. Sharpe ruled that the double standard amounted to "preferential treatment" for the protesters, exercising absolute monarchy on pretext of public health. The judge's decision is an important step towards inhibiting this emerging trend, ensuring freedom for all, not just those favored by the officials.
