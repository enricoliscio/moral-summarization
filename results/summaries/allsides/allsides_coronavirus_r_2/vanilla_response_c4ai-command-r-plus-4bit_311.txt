SUMMARY: In a recent ruling, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe sided with religious freedom advocates, issuing a preliminary injunction against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The injunction prohibits the enforcement of arbitrary limits on religious gatherings while allowing mass protests of racial injustice to continue unrestricted. Judge Sharpe noted the hypocrisy in limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests, arguing that it amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters. The decision effectively prevents Cuomo and de Blasio from imposing any limitations on outdoor gatherings and restricts them from imposing stricter limits on indoor religious gatherings compared to businesses. The case was brought forward by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants represented by the conservative law firm Thomas More Society. Their attorney, Christopher Ferrara, celebrated the decision as a victory for religious freedom and a step towards preventing the abuse of power in the name of public health.
END OF SUMMARY.
