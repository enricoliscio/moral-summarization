SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio cannot limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the officials from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The ruling notes that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The order effectively states that the officials cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and cannot impose limitations on indoor gatherings that are out-of-step with New York's reopening plan. The judge pointed out the hypocrisy of allowing mass protests while limiting other forms of public assembly, arguing that it amounts to "preferential treatment" for the protesters. The ruling is seen as a win for religious freedom advocates and a step towards inhibiting the trend of exercising absolute monarchy on pretext of public health.
