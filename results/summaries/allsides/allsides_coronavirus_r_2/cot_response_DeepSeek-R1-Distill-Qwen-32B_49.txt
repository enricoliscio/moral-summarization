Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with the moral framing preserved. The user provided a detailed article about a court ruling related to religious gatherings during the pandemic. They also gave specific instructions on how to process the text: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. I think they're words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. So, I should go through the article and pick out words that express judgment or moral evaluation.

Looking at the article, I see words like "win," "wrong," "curtailment," "fundamental rights," "compelling justification," "sham," "hypocrisy," "preferential treatment," "absolute monarchy," "discrimination," "freedom," "equality," "discriminate," "hypocrisy," and "double standard." These words seem to carry moral weight, indicating that the author is making a judgment about the actions of Cuomo and de Blasio.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be no more than 200 words and should capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral issues raised. I should make sure to include the key points: the court ruling, the comparison between religious gatherings and protests, the hypocrisy pointed out by the judge, and the implications for religious freedom.

I'll start by stating the court's decision in favor of religious freedom, then mention the comparison between protests and religious gatherings. I'll highlight the judge's points about the lack of compelling justification and the preferential treatment. I'll also include the criticism from the Thomas More Society about the inconsistency and the concern about the erosion of religious freedom.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the morally framed words without making it sound forced. It's important to maintain the original tone and the moral perspective presented in the article.

After drafting the summary, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that all the key points are covered. I'll also verify that the morally framed words are appropriately included to preserve the author's framing.

Finally, I'll structure the response by first listing the morally framed words in step 1 and then providing the summary after the specified tokens. This should meet the user's requirements and effectively convey the moral aspects of the article.

### SUMMARY:  
A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio were wrong to limit religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while allowing mass protests. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The judge criticized the officials for curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification, noting their hypocrisy in preferential treatment for protests over religious assemblies. Cuomo and de Blasio supported mass protests despite enforcing strict limits on other gatherings, which Sharpe called a double standard. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was a sham, as it was ignored during protests. The ruling highlights the erosion of religious freedom and the need for equality in public health measures, emphasizing that freedom for some should not mean discrimination against others. END OF SUMMARY.
