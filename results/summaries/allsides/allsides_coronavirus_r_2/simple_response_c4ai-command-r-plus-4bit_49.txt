SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York's Governor Cuomo and New York City's Mayor de Blasio were wrong to restrict religious gatherings while allowing mass protests for racial injustice. Judge Sharpe's decision highlighted the hypocrisy of the officials' actions, arguing that they gave "preferential treatment" to protesters over religious groups. The ruling prohibits the enforcement of arbitrary limits on church gatherings and restricts the imposition of limitations on indoor and outdoor gatherings. The decision was praised by the Thomas More Society, who represented Catholic priests and Jewish congregants in the case, as a victory against "absolute monarchy on pretext of public health." The ruling underscores the importance of preserving fundamental rights and freedoms, even during challenging times, and serves as a reminder that public health concerns should not be used as a pretext for arbitrary or discriminatory restrictions on gatherings.

END OF SUMMARY.
