Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article talks about a federal judge's ruling in New York regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic. The judge found that Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio were unfairly limiting religious groups while allowing mass protests. 

First, I should identify the key points: the judge's ruling, the comparison between religious gatherings and protests, the hypocrisy mentioned, and the implications on religious freedom. The author presents this as a moral issue, highlighting the double standard and the impact on fundamental rights.

I need to make sure the summary captures the judge's injunction, the reasoning about fundamental rights, the specific occupancy limits, and the criticism of Cuomo and de Blasio's preferential treatment. Also, include the Thomas More Society's perspective on the sham of Cuomo's protocol and the broader concern about absolute authority under public health pretext.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the ruling, then the details of the injunction, the hypocrisy, and the societal implications. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while maintaining the moral critique is essential.

I'll start by stating the judge's decision in favor of religious freedom, mention the injunction against Cuomo and de Blasio, explain the occupancy limits, and then discuss the hypocrisy in allowing protests while restricting religious gatherings. Finally, I'll touch on the societal concern about absolute authority and the importance of the ruling.

Let me make sure I include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, preserving the moral framing by emphasizing the unfair treatment and the threat to fundamental rights.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio unfairly limited religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while allowing mass protests for racial justice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, emphasizing that such restrictions without compelling justification infringe on fundamental rights. The ruling allows outdoor gatherings and indoor gatherings in line with New York's reopening plan, which previously limited religious gatherings to 25% occupancy. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, as they supported mass protests while enforcing restrictions on other gatherings. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" was disregarded for protests, highlighting a double standard. Sharpe noted that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health but instead endorsed them, sending a message of preferential treatment. The ruling underscores concerns about arbitrary authority under public health pretenses. END OF SUMMARY.
