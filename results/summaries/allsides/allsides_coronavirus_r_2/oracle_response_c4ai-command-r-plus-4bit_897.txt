SUMMARY: In a victory for religious freedom advocates, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, prohibiting them from limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests. Judge Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, arguing that the officials' decisions curtailed fundamental rights without justification. The ruling states that New York officials cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and must follow the state's reopening plan for indoor gatherings. The Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm, represented religious groups in the case, highlighting the hypocrisy of banning high school graduations while encouraging mass protests. Sharpe's ruling pointed out the preferential treatment given to protesters, noting that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead sent a clear message of preferential treatment. The decision inhibits the exercise of absolute power under the pretext of public health, ensuring freedom for all.
END OF SUMMARY.
