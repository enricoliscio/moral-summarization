SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cannot limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the officials from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The ruling notes that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The order states that religious gatherings cannot be limited more severely than "essential" and "nonessential" businesses. The judge criticized the officials for their hypocrisy, arguing that they gave preferential treatment to protesters while enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly. The ruling is seen as an important step towards preventing the abuse of power under the pretext of public health.
