SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are wrong to limit religious gatherings in the name of public health while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. The judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the officials from imposing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, arguing that their decisions curtailed fundamental rights without a compelling justification. The order states that the officials cannot impose any limitation on outdoor gatherings and must follow the same occupancy rules for indoor religious gatherings as for "essential" and "nonessential" businesses. The ruling points out the hypocrisy and preferential treatment given to protesters, arguing that the officials encouraged and supported mass protests while continuing to ban other forms of public assembly. It sends a clear message that religious freedom and the right to peaceful assembly must be treated equally and fairly, and that public health cannot be used as a pretext for arbitrary limitations on fundamental rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
