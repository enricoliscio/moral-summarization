Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about a court ruling regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic. The judge ruled against Cuomo and de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings while supporting protests. The key points are the legal decision, the hypocrisy in treating protests differently, and the implications for religious freedom.

First, I should identify the morally charged words the author used. Words like "ruled," "limit," "supporting," "injustice," etc. I need to make sure these are included in the summary to maintain the author's moral stance.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the judge's decision, the hypocrisy pointed out, and the impact on religious groups. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me start drafting: The judge ruled against Cuomo and de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings while supporting protests. This shows hypocrisy and preferential treatment. The injunction stops them from enforcing arbitrary limits, especially since they allowed large protests. The author emphasizes the moral issue of unequal treatment under the guise of public health. I'll make sure to include terms like "injunction," "hypocrisy," "preferential treatment," and "curtailment" to reflect the moral framing.

I should also mention the specific details, like the 25% occupancy limit for religious groups versus the mass protests. That contrast is crucial for the moral argument. Finally, I'll note that the ruling is a step toward preventing arbitrary power, highlighting the broader implications.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I think I've covered all the essential points while preserving the moral language. Time to put it all together clearly and concisely.

SUMMARY:  
A federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The judge criticized the officials for hypocrisy, noting their preferential treatment of protests over religious assemblies. While Cuomo and de Blasio allowed thousands of protesters to gather without enforcing social distancing, they continued to ban outdoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including religious events. Sharpe argued that this double standard amounted to "preferential treatment" and curtailed fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling highlights the moral inconsistency in enforcing public health measures selectively, favoring certain groups while banning others. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, welcomed the decision, calling it an important step toward preventing arbitrary power under the guise of public health. END OF SUMMARY.
