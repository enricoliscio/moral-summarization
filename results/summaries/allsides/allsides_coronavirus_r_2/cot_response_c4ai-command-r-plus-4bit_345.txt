SUMMARY: In a win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are wrong in limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests against racial injustice. The judge issued an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of arbitrary limits on church gatherings, noting that it curtails fundamental rights without justification. The ruling effectively states that New York officials cannot impose limitations on outdoor gatherings and must allow indoor gatherings with similar occupancy to "essential" businesses. The decision was praised as a victory over the "sham" of social distancing protocols, which were ignored during the mass protests that the officials favored. The preferential treatment of protests over other gatherings was highlighted as an emerging trend of absolute monarchy disguised as public health concern, where freedom is selectively granted. END OF SUMMARY.
