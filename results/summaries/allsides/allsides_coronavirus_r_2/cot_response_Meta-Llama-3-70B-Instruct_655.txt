SUMMARY:
In a significant win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were wrong to limit religious gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The ruling prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing "preferential treatment" for protesters. The judge noted that the officials could have discouraged protests in the name of public health, but instead sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of "preferential treatment." This decision is an important step toward inhibiting the emerging trend of exercising "absolute monarchy" on the pretext of public health, where "freedom for me, but not for thee" is the reality.
