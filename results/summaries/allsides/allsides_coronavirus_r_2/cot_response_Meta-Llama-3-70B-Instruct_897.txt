SUMMARY:
In a significant win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's arbitrary limits on religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. The judge argued that the officials' decision to support mass protests of racial injustice while limiting church gatherings was a clear case of hypocrisy and preferential treatment. The ruling prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing any limits on church gatherings that are not in line with the state's reopening plan. The Thomas More Society, which represented the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as an important step towards preventing the emergence of an "absolute monarchy" on the pretext of public health. The society's Special Counsel, Christopher Ferrara, noted that the decision exposes the "sham" of Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" and ensures that freedom is not just for those who support the officials' favored causes.
