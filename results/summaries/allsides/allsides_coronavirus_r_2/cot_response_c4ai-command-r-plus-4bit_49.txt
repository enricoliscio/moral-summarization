SUMMARY:
A federal judge's ruling against New York's governor and mayor is a win for religious freedom advocates. The decision prohibits the arbitrary limitations on religious gatherings, which were deemed wrong as they supported mass protests while curtailing religious freedom. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, noted that the officials' actions sent a clear message of preferential treatment for the protesters. He argued that they could have discouraged protests while still supporting their message, instead of encouraging the flagrant disregard for social distancing rules. 

The ruling was in response to a complaint filed by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, represented by the Thomas More Society. They argued that the officials' support for mass protests while still enforcing limitations on religious gatherings was a sham. The society's special counsel, Christopher Ferrara, stated that the decision was an important step towards inhibiting absolute monarchy and promoting freedom. 

The injunction effectively prohibits any limitations on outdoor gatherings and any disproportionate limitations on indoor ones. It highlights the double standard applied to religious gatherings compared to protests, which were encouraged and given preferential treatment by the governor and mayor. 

END OF SUMMARY.
