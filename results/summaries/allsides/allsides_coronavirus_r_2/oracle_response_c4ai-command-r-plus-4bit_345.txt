SUMMARY: In a victory for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who wrongfully limited religious gatherings while supporting mass protests against racial injustice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting arbitrary limits on church gatherings, stating that officials cannot curtail fundamental rights without a compelling justification. The decision effectively prevents the imposition of any limitations on outdoor gatherings and unreasonable restrictions on indoor gatherings. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, highlighted the hypocrisy of allowing mass protests while restricting religious gatherings, calling it "freedom for me, but not for thee." Sharpe's ruling pointed out the preferential treatment given to protesters by Cuomo and de Blasio, who encouraged and supported the protests while still enforcing limitations on other forms of public assembly. This decision is a significant step towards inhibiting the arbitrary exercise of power and ensuring equal treatment for all forms of assembly, regardless of the message being conveyed.
END OF SUMMARY.
