Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a federal judge ruling on religious gatherings during the pandemic. New York's Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio were limiting religious gatherings but allowed mass protests. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued an injunction against them, saying they can't limit religious gatherings arbitrarily. He pointed out the double standard because they supported protests while restricting religious events. The judge mentioned that the government can't curtail fundamental rights without a compelling reason. The ruling means they can't limit outdoor gatherings and indoor ones must follow the reopening plan's phases. The Thomas More Society, a conservative group, represented the plaintiffs and criticized Cuomo's inconsistent enforcement. They saw it as hypocrisy, allowing protests but banning other gatherings. The article also mentions that after George Floyd's death, protests were allowed despite pandemic restrictions, which the judge called "preferential treatment." The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words, and include the key players, the ruling, the hypocrisy, and the implications. I should make sure to mention the judge's injunction, the comparison between protests and religious gatherings, and the criticism of Cuomo and de Blasio's actions. Also, include the reaction from the Thomas More Society and the implications of the ruling on religious freedom. Let me structure this into a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings during the pandemic while allowing mass protests. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials cannot impose arbitrary restrictions on religious gatherings. He criticized the double standard, noting that while Cuomo and de Blasio supported protests, they enforced limits on other gatherings, which he called "preferential treatment." The ruling prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from limiting outdoor religious gatherings and indoor ones beyond the state's reopening plan. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, criticized Cuomo's inconsistent enforcement, highlighting the hypocrisy of supporting protests while banning other events. The decision underscores the importance of protecting religious freedom and challenges the notion of absolute authority under public health pretenses. END OF SUMMARY.
