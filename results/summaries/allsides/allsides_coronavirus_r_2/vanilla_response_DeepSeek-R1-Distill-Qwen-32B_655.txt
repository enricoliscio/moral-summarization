Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a federal judge's ruling regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning a win for religious freedom advocates. A federal judge, Gary L. Sharpe, ruled against Cuomo and de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings while allowing mass protests. The key point here is the inconsistency in how gatherings are treated.

Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction stopping Cuomo, his attorney general, and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. The judge emphasized that while officials have the right to make tough decisions during a pandemic, they can't infringe on fundamental rights without a compelling reason.

The ruling specifies that New York officials can't limit outdoor gatherings and can't impose indoor restrictions beyond what's in the reopening plan. Under the plan, religious gatherings were capped at 25%, which is stricter than nonessential businesses at 50%.

The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued that Cuomo's social distancing rules were selectively enforced. They pointed out that when protests happened, Cuomo and de Blasio supported them, ignoring the 25-person limit, while still restricting other gatherings.

Sharpe criticized the officials for hypocrisy, calling it preferential treatment. They could have discouraged protests for public health but instead supported them, sending a message that protests were more deserving.

The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should include the judge's ruling, the comparison between religious gatherings and protests, the specifics of the injunction, and the criticism of hypocrisy.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the main facts without getting too detailed. Also, I should end with the specified tokens.
