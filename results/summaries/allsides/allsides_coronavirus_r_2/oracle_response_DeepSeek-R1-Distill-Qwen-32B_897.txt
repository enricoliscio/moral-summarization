SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic while supporting mass protests of racial injustice. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings. Sharpe criticized the officials for their double standard, arguing their actions amounted to "preferential treatment" for protests while continuing to ban other gatherings, such as high school graduations. The judge emphasized that the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification was unacceptable. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, criticized Cuomo's "Social Distancing Protocol" as a sham, pointing out that the officials encouraged mass protests while enforcing strict limits on religious gatherings. Sharpe's ruling highlighted the hypocrisy, stating that Cuomo and de Blasio could have discouraged protests for public health reasons but instead sent a message that mass protests deserved preferential treatment. The decision is seen as an important step toward inhibiting the exercise of absolute authority under the pretext of public health. END OF SUMMARY.
