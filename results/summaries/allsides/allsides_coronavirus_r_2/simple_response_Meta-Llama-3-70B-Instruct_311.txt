SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio cannot limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. The judge's decision prohibits the officials from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing a double standard in their treatment of protests versus other public assemblies. The ruling notes that while "essential" businesses are allowed 100% occupancy and "nonessential" businesses 50%, religious gatherings were limited to 25% occupancy. The judge argues that the officials' support for protests while restricting other gatherings amounts to "preferential treatment" and undermines their claim to be prioritizing public health. The decision is seen as a win for religious freedom and a check on government overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
