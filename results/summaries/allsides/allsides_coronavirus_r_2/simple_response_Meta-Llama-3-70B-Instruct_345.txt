SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio cannot limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests for racial injustice. The judge's decision prohibits the officials from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, citing a double standard in their treatment of protests versus other forms of public assembly. The ruling notes that while "essential" businesses are allowed 100% occupancy and "nonessential" businesses are allowed 50%, religious gatherings were previously limited to 25% occupancy. The judge argues that the officials' preferential treatment of protests amounts to hypocrisy, as they could have discouraged protests in the name of public health but instead encouraged them. The decision is seen as a win for religious freedom and a step towards preventing the abuse of power under the pretext of public health.
