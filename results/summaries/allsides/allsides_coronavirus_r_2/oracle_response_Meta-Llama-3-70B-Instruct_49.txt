SUMMARY:

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has prohibited New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, citing hypocrisy and preferential treatment for mass protests. The judge's decision inhibits the officials' arbitrary enforcement of restrictions on church gatherings, which were previously confined to 25% occupancy, while "essential" businesses were granted 100% occupancy. The ruling effectively ends the curtailment of fundamental rights without compelling justification. The judge noted that the officials could have discouraged protests or remained silent, but instead sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment. The decision is a win for religious freedom advocates, who argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without justification. The ruling is an important step towards preventing the exercise of absolute monarchy on the pretext of public health.
