SUMMARY:

A federal judge has ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, prohibiting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from limiting religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic while supporting mass protests. The judge, Gary L. Sharpe, issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limits on church gatherings without compelling justification. The ruling notes that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights, specifically targeting religious gatherings while allowing mass protests to occur. The judge pointed out the hypocrisy, arguing that the officials' actions amounted to "preferential treatment" for protesters. The ruling effectively states that religious gatherings cannot be limited more severely than "essential" and "nonessential" businesses under the state's reopening plan. The decision is seen as a win for religious freedom advocates and a step towards preventing the abuse of power under the pretext of public health.
