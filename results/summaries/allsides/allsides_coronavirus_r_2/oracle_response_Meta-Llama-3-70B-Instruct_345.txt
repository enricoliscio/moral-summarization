SUMMARY:

In a significant win for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's arbitrary limits on religious gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. The judge's decision issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the officials from enforcing any limits on church gatherings without compelling justification. This ruling highlights the hypocrisy of the officials, who supported mass protests of racial injustice while continuing to ban high school graduations and other outdoor gatherings exceeding 25 people. The judge argued that the officials' decisions resulted in the curtailment of fundamental rights without justification, exercising preferential treatment for the protesters. By acting as they did, Cuomo and de Blasio sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment. This decision is an important step toward inhibiting the emerging trend of exercising absolute monarchy on pretext of public health. END OF SUMMARY.
