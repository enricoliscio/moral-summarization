Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about a court ruling in New York regarding religious gatherings during the pandemic. A federal judge, Gary L. Sharpe, ruled against Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, saying they shouldn't limit religious gatherings while supporting mass protests. The judge issued an injunction stopping them from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings.

The key points are:
- Judge Sharpe found it hypocritical that Cuomo and de Blasio allowed mass protests (like the ones after George Floyd's death) but restricted religious gatherings.
- The ruling prohibits them from limiting outdoor gatherings and indoor gatherings beyond what's allowed in phases two and three of the reopening plan.
- Cuomo's social distancing protocols were criticized as inconsistent because they were relaxed for protests but not for religious events.
- The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, brought the case, arguing against preferential treatment for protests over religious gatherings.
- The judge pointed out the double standard, saying the officials could have handled it differently but instead gave preferential treatment to protests.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these points without getting too detailed. I should mention the judge's ruling, the hypocrisy, the specifics of the injunction, the groups involved, and the impact of the decision on religious freedom versus protests.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduce the judge's ruling against Cuomo and de Blasio.
2. Explain the hypocrisy between allowing protests and restricting religious gatherings.
3. Mention the injunction details regarding outdoor and indoor gatherings.
4. Note the criticism of Cuomo's inconsistent social distancing policies.
5. Include the involvement of the Thomas More Society and their stance.
6. Highlight the judge's point about preferential treatment and the broader implication for public health measures.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all these aspects without being too wordy. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit.

A federal judge ruled against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, finding their restrictions on religious gatherings during the pandemic hypocritical compared to their support for mass protests. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued an injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary limits on church gatherings, stating their actions showed preferential treatment for protests over religious events. The ruling allows outdoor gatherings without limits and indoor gatherings in line with the state's reopening plan. Cuomo's inconsistent social distancing policies were criticized, as they were relaxed for protests but not for religious services. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, argued against this double standard, emphasizing the need for equal treatment under public health measures. The judge highlighted the hypocrisy, noting the officials could have handled protests differently but instead favored them over religious gatherings, raising concerns about selective enforcement of public health guidelines.
