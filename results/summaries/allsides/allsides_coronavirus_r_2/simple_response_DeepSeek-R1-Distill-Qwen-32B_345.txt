Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a federal judge ruling in favor of religious freedom advocates against Cuomo and de Blasio's pandemic restrictions. The key points are the judge's injunction against limiting religious gatherings, the hypocrisy in allowing protests but not religious events, and the moral argument about equal treatment under the law. I should make sure to include the judge's reasoning, the specific occupancy rules, and the criticism of preferential treatment. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all important details are covered without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled in favor of religious freedom advocates, stating that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio improperly limited religious gatherings during the pandemic while allowing mass protests. U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing arbitrary restrictions on church gatherings. The judge criticized the officials for failing to provide a compelling justification for curbing fundamental rights. Under New York's reopening plan, religious gatherings were limited to 25% occupancy, while "essential" businesses were allowed 100% and "nonessential" businesses 50%. The judge noted hypocrisy, as Cuomo and de Blasio supported mass protests without enforcing social distancing rules, while restricting other gatherings. The ruling highlights the preferential treatment given to protests, arguing that this double standard undermines equal protection under the law. The Thomas More Society, representing Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, praised the decision, calling it a step toward curbing arbitrary power under public health pretext. END OF SUMMARY.
