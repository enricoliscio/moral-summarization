SUMMARY: In a victory for religious freedom advocates, a federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for limiting religious gatherings while supporting mass protests. Judge Gary L. Sharpe issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limits on church gatherings and cannot treat protests differently from religious gatherings. The decision was made in response to a complaint filed by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants who argued that the officials' actions curtailed their fundamental rights without justification. The judge noted the hypocrisy of the officials in enforcing limitations on religious gatherings while openly supporting mass protests, calling it "preferential treatment." The ruling prohibits the enforcement of any limitations on outdoor gatherings and restricts indoor gathering limitations to those consistent with phases two and three of New York's reopening plan. The decision was praised by the Thomas More Society, a conservative law firm representing the religious groups, as a step towards inhibiting absolute monarchy disguised as public health concerns.
