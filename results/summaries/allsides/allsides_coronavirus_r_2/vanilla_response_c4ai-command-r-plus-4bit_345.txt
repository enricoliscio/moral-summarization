SUMMARY: A federal judge ruled against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had imposed limitations on religious gatherings while supporting mass protests during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge's decision states that the officials cannot impose arbitrary limits on outdoor gatherings and must follow the state's reopening plan for indoor gatherings. The ruling was made in response to a complaint filed by a group of Catholic priests and Jewish congregants, who argued that the limitations on religious gatherings infringed on their religious freedom. The judge, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Sharpe, pointed out the hypocrisy of the officials in supporting mass protests while restricting other forms of public assembly, calling it "preferential treatment." The decision prohibits Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing any arbitrary limits on church gatherings and grants "essential" businesses 100% occupancy and "nonessential" businesses 50% occupancy, while religious gatherings are limited to 25% occupancy.
END OF SUMMARY.
