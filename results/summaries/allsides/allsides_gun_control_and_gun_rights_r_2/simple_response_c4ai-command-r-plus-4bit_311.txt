SUMMARY: Good guys with guns save lives. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old volunteer security guard at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, stopped a potential mass shooting in mere seconds. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing licensed gun owners to carry their weapons into places of worship, a move that was criticized by gun-control advocates. However, Wilson's quick action proves that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms can help prevent mass shootings.

The argument that guns rarely stop mass shootings is misleading, as most of these incidents occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of armed citizens can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. While mass shootings are rare, there is no downside to allowing congregations to govern their own security and protect themselves. The right to self-defense is a fundamental principle, and Texans, in particular, seem to recognize this.

END OF SUMMARY.
