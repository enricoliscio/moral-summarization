Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I have to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a congregant with a gun. The author supports allowing concealed-carry in places of worship, arguing that it's effective in preventing mass shootings. They criticize gun-control advocates and Democrats for not focusing on stopping actual killers but rather on restricting law-abiding citizens.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. Let me go through the article and pick them out.

- "good guys" (positive)
- "save lives" (positive)
- "opened fire" (negative)
- "parishioners" (neutral, but context is negative)
- "gunman" (negative)
- "killed" (negative)
- "anti-Semite" (negative)
- "thug" (negative)
- "fortunate" (positive)
- "perpetrator" (negative)
- "firearm" (neutral, but context is negative)
- "mass murderer" (negative)
- "concealed-carry licenses" (neutral, but context positive)
- "protections" (positive)
- "stopped" (positive)
- "mass shooter" (negative)
- "dismay" (negative)
- "Democrats" (neutral, but context negative)
- "gun laws" (neutral, but context negative)
- "hostility" (negative)
- "gun-control advocates" (negative)
- "do something" (positive intent but context negative)
- "inhibit" (negative)
- "law-abiding citizens" (positive)
- "media" (neutral, but context negative)
- "nefarious" (negative)
- "CNN" (neutral, but context negative)
- "Walmart shooting" (negative)
- "El Paso" (neutral, but context negative)
- "mass shooting" (negative)
- "five dead" (negative)
- "irrational" (negative)
- "Second Amendment" (positive)
- "self-defense" (positive)
- "primary canon" (positive)
- "deranged" (negative)
- "soft targets" (negative)
- "murderers" (negative)
- "mitigate" (positive)
- "damage" (negative)
- "mass shootings" (negative)
- "AR-15" (neutral, but context negative)
- "mass killer" (negative)
- "four people" (neutral, but context negative)
- "churches" (neutral, but context negative)
- "downside" (negative)
- "defenseless" (negative)
- "Draconian laws" (negative)
- "self-protection" (positive)
- "Zionist" (neutral, but context positive)
- "arm" (positive)
- "exist" (positive)
- "defend" (positive)
- "Jabotinsky" (neutral, but context positive)
- "slogans" (neutral, but context positive)
- "blessed" (positive)
- "inherent right" (positive)

Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral frame. I should focus on words that clearly have a positive or negative connotation. Let me go through again and list only the most impactful ones.

- "good guys" (positive)
- "save lives" (positive)
- "opened fire" (negative)
- "gunman" (negative)
- "anti-Semite" (negative)
- "thug" (negative)
- "fortunate" (positive)
- "perpetrator" (negative)
- "firearm" (negative)
- "mass murderer" (negative)
- "hostility" (negative)
- "inhibit" (negative)
- "law-abiding citizens" (positive)
- "nefarious" (negative)
- "mass shooting" (negative)
- "five dead" (negative)
- "irrational" (negative)
- "self-defense" (positive)
- "deranged" (negative)
- "soft targets" (negative)
- "murderers" (negative)
- "mitigate" (positive)
- "damage" (negative)
- "mass shootings" (negative)
- "AR-15" (negative)
- "mass killer" (negative)
- "four people" (neutral, but context negative)
- "defenseless" (negative)
- "Draconian laws" (negative)
- "self-protection" (positive)
- "arm" (positive)
- "defend" (positive)
- "slogans" (neutral, but context positive)
- "blessed" (positive)
- "inherent right" (positive)

I think that's a comprehensive list. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise and under 200 words. The summary should highlight the main points: the incident at the church, the effectiveness of allowing concealed-carry, the criticism of gun-control, and the moral arguments presented.

I'll start by mentioning the church incident and how the congregant stopped the gunman. Then, I'll note the Texas law allowing concealed-carry and its effectiveness. I'll contrast this with the criticism from gun-control advocates and Democrats. I'll include the moral framing words like "good guys," "save lives," "anti-Semite," "thug," "hostility," "inhibit," "law-abiding citizens," "self-defense," "deranged," "soft targets," "murderers," "mitigate," "damage," "mass shootings," "AR-15," "mass killer," "defenseless," "Draconian laws," "self-protection," "arm," "defend," "blessed," "inherent right."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes these words without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to first describe the event, then the law, the criticism, and the moral arguments for allowing concealed-carry.

Let me draft the summary:

In an incident at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, a gunman opened fire, but a congregant with a concealed-carry license stopped him, saving lives. This highlights the effectiveness of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in places of worship, as opposed to gun-free zones where mass shootings often occur. Critics, including gun-control advocates and Democrats, argue against such laws, claiming they inhibit self-defense and create hostility. However, supporters emphasize that trained individuals can prevent tragedies, as seen in cases like the Sutherland Spring shooting. The article argues that restricting concealed-carry in vulnerable communities, such as Orthodox Jews in New York, leaves them defenseless, while states like Texas empower citizens to defend themselves, aligning with the Second Amendment and the inherent right to self-protection.

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down, ensuring I include the key morally framed words without exceeding 200 words.

In Texas, a gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ, but a congregant with a concealed-carry license stopped him, saving lives. This incident underscores the effectiveness of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in places of worship. Critics, including gun-control advocates and Democrats, argue that such laws create hostility and inhibit self-defense, but supporters counter that trained individuals can prevent mass shootings. The article highlights that mass shootings often occur in gun-free zones, where soft targets are more vulnerable. By allowing concealed-carry, communities can mitigate damage and deter murderers. Restricting firearms in vulnerable groups, like Orthodox Jews in New York, leaves them defenseless, while states like Texas empower citizens to defend themselves, aligning with the Second Amendment and the inherent right to self-protection.

That's concise and includes many of the morally framed words. I think this meets the requirements.
