SUMMARY:
In Texas, a "good guy with a gun" stopped a potential mass murderer at the West Freeway Church of Christ. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, took mere seconds to stop the shooter. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had signed a bill making it legal for Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into churches, a move that has generated hostility among gun-control advocates. The author argues that this law is not "irrational" and that it is essential to allow citizens to protect themselves, their community, and their family in a place of worship. The presence of "good guys with guns" can mitigate the damage inflicted by deranged shooters. END OF SUMMARY.
