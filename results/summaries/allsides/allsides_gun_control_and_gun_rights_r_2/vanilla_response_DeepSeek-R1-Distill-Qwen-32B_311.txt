Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a situation where a gunman attacked a church in Texas, and a security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped him. It mentions Texas' law allowing concealed-carry permits in places of worship, which was signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The author contrasts this with other incidents, like the Orthodox Jews in New York who had to defend themselves with chairs and coffee tables because they couldn't carry guns. 

The main points seem to be that having armed security can prevent mass shootings, and that current gun laws in some places restrict law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves. The author argues against strict gun control, using historical examples like Israel and the words of Ze’ev Jabotinsky. They also mention that allowing trained individuals to carry guns in churches doesn't force anyone to arm themselves but gives the option. 

I should highlight the key events: the church shooting, Wilson's actions, Texas' law, comparison with New York's situation, and the argument about self-defense rights. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on these points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to make sure to include the summary within the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped him, highlighting the effectiveness of allowing trained individuals to carry concealed firearms in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had earlier signed a bill permitting concealed-carry permit holders to bring guns to churches. The article contrasts this with incidents in New York, where Orthodox Jews faced knife-wielding attackers but couldn’t use firearms for defense due to strict laws. The author argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves in public spaces, like churches, is a right supported by the Second Amendment, citing historical examples such as Israel’s self-defense ethos. The piece emphasizes that while no solution can completely prevent mass shootings, arming trained individuals can deter or mitigate such events, and that forcing congregations to remain defenseless is problematic.
