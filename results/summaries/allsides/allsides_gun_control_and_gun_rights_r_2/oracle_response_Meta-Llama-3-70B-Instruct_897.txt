SUMMARY:

A heroic security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped a potential mass murderer at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, saving lives. This incident highlights the importance of allowing good guys with guns to protect themselves and their communities. In contrast, gun-control advocates often prioritize inhibiting law-abiding citizens from owning guns over stopping violent criminals. The Texas law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, explicitly allows concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship, a move that has generated hostility among gun-control advocates. However, this law has proven effective in stopping mass shooters, as seen in the West Freeway Church of Christ incident. By allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns, we can mitigate damage and protect ourselves and our communities from violent attacks. It's time to recognize the value of good guys with guns in stopping violence and protecting lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
