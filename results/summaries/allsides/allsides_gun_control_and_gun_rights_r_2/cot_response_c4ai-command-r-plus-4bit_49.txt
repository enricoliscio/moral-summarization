SUMMARY:
In the wake of a gunman opening fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, the moral framing of the event and the broader issue of gun control are brought to the forefront. The heroic actions of 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer Jack Wilson, who swiftly stopped the potential mass murderer, exemplify the good that can come from allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms for protection. Texas governor Greg Abbott's decision to sign a bill legalizing concealed carry in places of worship is framed as a virtuous act, empowering responsible individuals to defend themselves and others. 

The article condemns the viewpoint of gun-control advocates who seek to inhibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns, highlighting the irrationality of such positions and their potential to endanger innocent lives. The right to self-defense, a fundamental principle cited by John Adams, is emphasized as a moral imperative, especially in places of worship. The ability to protect oneself and the community from deranged individuals is presented as a noble duty. 

Furthermore, the piece underscores the misleading nature of arguments against guns, pointing out that most mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. The presence of good guys with guns is seen as a deterrent to potential shooters seeking soft targets. The actions of other armed citizens who have mitigated damage in past mass shooting incidents are also lauded as virtuous and heroic. 

The article concludes by emphasizing the freedom to choose one's security measures, such as the Mormon Church's decision to ban firearms. However, it condemns states that compel defenselessness, infringing on the inherent right to self-defense, especially for vulnerable groups like Orthodox Jews who have increasingly become targets of violence. The historical context of Jews defending themselves in Israel is invoked, highlighting the importance of self-protection and the right to bear arms. 

END OF SUMMARY.
