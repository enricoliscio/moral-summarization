Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a congregant with a gun. The author is pro-gun rights, emphasizing that allowing trained individuals to carry guns in places of worship can prevent mass shootings. They contrast this with restrictive laws in other areas, like New York, where such defense isn't possible. The moral argument here is about self-defense and the right to protect oneself and others, drawing parallels to historical Jewish self-defense in Israel. I should highlight the key points: the event, the effectiveness of armed security, the comparison to other incidents, and the broader debate on gun laws. I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the original's pro-gun stance.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant, Jack Wilson, a former deputy sheriff and security volunteer, stopped him with a concealed firearm. This incident highlights the debate over gun laws in places of worship. Texas allows concealed-carry permit holders to bring guns to churches, a policy supported by Governor Greg Abbott. The article argues that such laws enable trained individuals to prevent mass shootings, as seen in Texas, while restrictive laws in other areas, like New York, leave communities vulnerable. The author contrasts this with the effectiveness of armed defense, citing historical examples like Jewish self-defense in Israel and the U.S., emphasizing the moral right to self-protection. The piece criticizes gun-control advocates for focusing on inhibiting law-abiding citizens rather than addressing the root causes of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
