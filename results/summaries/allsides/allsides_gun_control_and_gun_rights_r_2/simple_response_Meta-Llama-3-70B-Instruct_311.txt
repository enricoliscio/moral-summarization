SUMMARY:

A recent shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas was stopped by a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, who was legally carrying a concealed firearm. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns in places of worship, as it can save lives. Despite this, gun-control advocates and Democrats continue to push for stricter laws, which would only inhibit responsible citizens from owning guns. The author argues that the presence of "good guys with guns" can deter or mitigate mass shootings, and that it's impossible to quantify how often their presence prevents attacks. The article also draws parallels with the Jewish community, citing the importance of self-defense and the right to protect oneself, as exemplified by the state of Israel. The author concludes that allowing citizens to carry guns in churches and schools is a necessary measure to ensure safety and protect human life.
