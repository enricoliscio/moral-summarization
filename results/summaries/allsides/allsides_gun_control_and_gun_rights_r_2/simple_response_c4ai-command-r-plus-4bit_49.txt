SUMMARY: Good guys with guns can save lives, as proven in the recent incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, where a gunman was stopped by a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship, a move that was criticized by gun-control advocates. However, this law enabled Wilson to stop a potential mass shooting, proving that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms can help prevent tragedies. The argument that guns rarely stop mass shootings is misleading, as most of these incidents occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of good guys with guns can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. While the chances of being caught in a mass shooting are rare, there is no downside to allowing congregations to govern their own security. The right to self-defense is a fundamental principle, as argued by John Adams and the Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who encouraged Jews to arm themselves for protection. Texas' stance on gun rights showcases a commitment to empowering citizens to protect themselves and their communities.
END OF SUMMARY.
