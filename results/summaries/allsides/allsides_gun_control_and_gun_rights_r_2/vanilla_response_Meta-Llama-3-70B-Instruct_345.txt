SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped the shooter, likely preventing a mass murder. Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, was able to respond quickly because of a Texas law that allows licensed individuals to carry concealed firearms into places of worship. The incident highlights the effectiveness of "good guys with guns" in stopping potential mass shooters. Despite this, many gun-control advocates oppose such laws, framing them as dangerous and irresponsible. The article argues that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry firearms can actually reduce gun violence, as they are more likely to deter shooters who prefer soft targets. The incident also underscores the importance of self-defense, particularly for vulnerable communities like Orthodox Jews in New York.
