Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman attacked, but a church member with a concealed-carry license stopped him. It contrasts this with a situation in New York where Orthodox Jews had to fight off a knife-wielding attacker without firearms. The author is clearly in favor of allowing trained individuals to carry guns in places of worship, citing Texas's law that permits this.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. They provided a list, so I need to make sure those words are incorporated. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the Texas church incident, the New York incident, the Texas law, and the author's argument in favor of concealed carry. I should mention the gunman, the volunteer who stopped him, the legal aspects, and the moral implications like protection, stopping violence, and self-defense.

I also need to highlight the contrast between Texas and New York, emphasizing how Texas's law allowed for protection while New York's restrictions left people vulnerable. Including terms like "fire," "save," "stop," "legal," "protections," "undeterred," "allowing," "violence," "protect," "shootings," "mitigate," "damage," "shot," "dropped," "killed," "compelling," "limitation," "defend," and "self-protection" will maintain the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the Texas incident, the law, the effectiveness, and then contrasting with New York. Ending with the broader implications about self-defense and the right to protect oneself ties it all together.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all necessary points and the moral words without exceeding the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the attacker in seconds. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had earlier signed a law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring firearms into places of worship, which Wilson used to protect the congregation. The author highlights that Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, likely would not have broken the law to carry a gun, unlike the killer, who would have been undeterred by legal restrictions. The article contrasts this with New York, where Orthodox Jews faced a knife-wielding attacker without the option to use firearms, emphasizing the moral argument for allowing trained individuals to protect themselves and others. The author argues that gun-free zones make for "soft targets" and that the presence of armed citizens can stop or mitigate mass shootings. The piece also draws parallels to Israel's self-defense ethos and criticizes restrictive gun laws as a limitation on self-protection. The author concludes that allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves aligns with the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense, as seen in Texas. END OF SUMMARY.
