SUMMARY: Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, stopped a potential mass shooting in mere seconds. This incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding gun laws in the United States. Texas governor Greg Abbott previously signed a bill allowing Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship, a move that was met with hostility by gun-control advocates. Advocates for gun control argue that allowing licensed and trained individuals to carry firearms in churches or schools inhibits efforts to stop gun violence. However, the argument that guns rarely stop mass shootings is misleading, as most of these incidents occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of good guys with guns can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. While the chances of being caught in a mass shooting are rare, there is no downside to allowing congregations to govern their own security. The right to self-defense is a fundamental principle, and Texans, in particular, seem to embrace this notion.

END OF SUMMARY.
