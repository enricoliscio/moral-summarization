SUMMARY: Texans with concealed-carry licenses can now legally bring their weapons into places of worship thanks to a bill signed by Governor Greg Abbott. This proved to be lifesaving when a gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ, and 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer Jack Wilson quickly stopped him. While gun-control advocates argue against allowing guns in churches or schools, the reality is that such laws only restrict law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves and their communities. The argument that guns don't stop mass shootings is misleading, as most of these incidents occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of good guys with guns can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage they inflict. Texans have recognized the importance of self-defense and the right to protect oneself and others, a moral and practical approach to ensuring safety.

END OF SUMMARY.
