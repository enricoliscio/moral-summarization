SUMMARY:
The recent incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas highlights the importance of good guys with guns in saving lives. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old security volunteer, stopped a potential mass murderer within seconds. Despite the fact that Texas governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allowing licensed gun owners to carry their weapons into places of worship, gun control advocates remain hostile to the idea. They argue that guns rarely stop mass shootings and that allowing guns in places of worship will only cause more harm. However, the author points out that most mass shootings occur in gun-free zones and that concealed carriers are law-abiding citizens. The presence of good guys with guns can also deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. The right to self-defense is a fundamental principle, and allowing congregations to govern their own security is a sensible approach. Draconian gun laws in states like New York leave law-abiding citizens defenseless and vulnerable to attacks. The Jewish community, in particular, should find these limitations offensive given their history of persecution. The state of Israel and the Zionist movement have long advocated for the right to self-defense, and this notion should be embraced in the United States as well. The good guys with guns are a testament to the importance of the Second Amendment and the right to protect oneself and others. 

END OF SUMMARY.
