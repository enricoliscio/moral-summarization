SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a good guy with a gun, 71-year-old Jack Wilson, took mere seconds to stop him. This incident highlights the moral dilemma of gun control. Texas governor Greg Abbott recently signed a bill allowing licensed Texans to carry concealed weapons into places of worship. This allowed Wilson to stop a potential mass murderer. Gun control advocates argue that guns rarely stop these high-profile events and that guns in churches or schools are immoral. However, most mass shootings happen in gun-free zones, and concealed carriers are law-abiding citizens. The presence of good guys with guns can mitigate damage and save lives. While the chances of being caught in a mass shooting are rare, there is no downside to allowing congregations to decide their own security measures. The right to self-defense is inherent and blessed, and it is offensive to force defenselessness upon normal people. Jews, in particular, should understand the triumph of picking up arms to defend themselves, as the state of Israel did. The Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky once advocated for the right to bear arms. This notion was once embraced in the United States and still is in Texas.
END OF SUMMARY.
