SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped the shooter, potentially saving lives. This incident highlights the effectiveness of "good guys with guns" in preventing mass shootings. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had signed a bill allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring weapons into places of worship, which enabled Wilson to act quickly. The article argues that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns in churches and schools can deter mass shootings, and that gun-free zones often attract shooters. It also notes that concealed carriers are law-abiding citizens who can mitigate damage in emergency situations. The article concludes that allowing congregations to govern their own security can be a lifesaving measure.

END OF SUMMARY.
