SUMMARY:
In Texas, a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped a potential mass murderer at West Freeway Church of Christ, saving lives. This was possible due to a law signed by Governor Greg Abbott, allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring weapons into places of worship. The author argues that this law is a necessary protection, as "good guys with guns" can mitigate damage and stop shooters. In contrast, gun-control advocates and Democrats are accused of wanting to "inhibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns." The author praises Texas for upholding the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense, citing examples of successful interventions by armed citizens. Meanwhile, states like New York are criticized for having "draconian laws" that make it difficult for people to practice their right to self-defense. END OF SUMMARY.
