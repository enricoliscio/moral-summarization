SUMMARY:

A recent shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas was stopped by a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, who was legally carrying a concealed weapon. This incident highlights the effectiveness of "good guys with guns" in saving lives. In contrast, gun control advocates often prioritize restricting law-abiding citizens' access to guns over allowing them to defend themselves. The author argues that concealed carriers are among the most law-abiding citizens and that the presence of guns can deter or mitigate mass shootings. The article also notes that many high-profile mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. The author criticizes draconian laws that restrict self-defense, particularly in light of the recent attacks on Orthodox Jews in New York. The piece concludes by invoking the Zionist notion that Jews should have the right to defend themselves, a principle that is still upheld in Texas.
