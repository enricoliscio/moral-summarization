SUMMARY: The article discusses the incident of a gunman opening fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, and how it was stopped by a good guy with a gun, Jack Wilson. The author argues that laws that allow licensed and trained individuals to carry firearms in places of worship can help stop mass shooters. They highlight that most mass shootings happen in gun-free zones and that concealed carriers are law-abiding citizens. The author also mentions other incidents where good guys with guns have stopped mass shootings, such as the shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, and the case of Jeanne Assam at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. They criticize gun-control advocates who oppose allowing armed security in places of worship and schools, arguing that there is no downside to letting congregations govern their own security. The article also brings up the point that Jews, in particular, should find limitations on the right to self-defense offensive, given the history of needing to defend themselves.
