SUMMARY:

A heroic security volunteer, Jack Wilson, 71, stopped a potential mass murderer at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, saving countless lives. This was made possible by a Texas law signed by Governor Greg Abbott, allowing licensed individuals to carry concealed firearms into places of worship. The law, however, has been met with hostility by gun-control advocates who claim it will increase gun violence. In reality, it is the "good guys with guns" who can stop mass shootings, as seen in this incident and others, such as the shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, and the case of Jeanne Assam at New Life Church in Colorado Springs. The presence of concealed carriers can mitigate damage and dissuade murderers, who prefer soft targets. It is essential to allow congregations to govern their own security, rather than compelling them to sit defenseless. The right to self-defense is a fundamental canon in the law of nature, and it is crucial to protect oneself, one's community, and one's family, especially in places of worship.
