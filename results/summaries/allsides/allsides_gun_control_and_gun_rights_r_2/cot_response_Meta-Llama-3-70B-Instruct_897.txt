SUMMARY:
In Texas, a "good guy with a gun" stopped a potential mass murderer at the West Freeway Church of Christ, highlighting the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms in places of worship. This incident contradicts the "irrational" stance of gun-control advocates who believe that stricter laws will prevent gun violence. In reality, the presence of trained and licensed individuals with guns can mitigate damage and even stop shooters. The Texas law, which allows concealed carry in churches, is a step towards protecting citizens' right to self-defense, a "primary canon in the law of nature." This approach is in stark contrast to states like New York, where "draconian laws" make it difficult for citizens to practice their right to self-defense. The author argues that allowing citizens to protect themselves is a fundamental right, and that "good guys with guns" can make a significant difference in preventing mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
