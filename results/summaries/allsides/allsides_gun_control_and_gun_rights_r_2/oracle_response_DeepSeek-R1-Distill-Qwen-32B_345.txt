Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a church in Texas where a gunman attacked, and a volunteer with a gun stopped him. The author supports the right to carry guns in places of worship, citing examples where this has prevented mass shootings. They also criticize gun control advocates and the media for framing this as negative, even though it's about protecting people.

I need to capture the key events: the attack, the volunteer stopping the gunman, the Texas law allowing concealed carry in churches, and the comparison with other incidents. Also, the author's stance against gun control and support for self-defense rights is crucial.

I should use the morally framed words like "fire," "save," "stop," "protect," "violence," "kill," "defend," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the positive outcome due to the volunteer's action, the legal protections in Texas, and the criticism of gun control policies.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the essential points and the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had signed a law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring firearms into places of worship, a move that enabled Wilson to protect the congregation. The author highlights that such protections have successfully stopped mass shooters, unlike national gun laws proposed by Democrats. Gun-control advocates oppose this, framing it as enabling violence, but the author argues that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to defend themselves. The article contrasts this with New York's restrictive laws, where Orthodox Jews have faced violence without the ability to protect themselves. The author emphasizes that allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in places of worship does not force congregations to arm themselves but offers a choice for self-protection. The moral framing underscores the importance of self-defense and the failure of gun-control measures to prevent violence, while highlighting the value of preparedness in saving lives. END OF SUMMARY.
