Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article discusses a situation where a church in Texas had a gunman, and a congregant with a concealed-carry license stopped him. The author is clearly in favor of allowing such individuals to carry firearms in places of worship. They mention Texas Governor Greg Abbott's law that permits this, contrasting it with the Democratic approach of gun control. The author argues that having trained individuals with guns can prevent mass shootings, referencing other incidents where this was effective. They also criticize media and political figures like Joe Biden for opposing such laws, framing it as an attack on Second Amendment rights. The article uses historical examples, like Israel's self-defense, to support the argument that self-protection is a moral right.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should highlight the key events, the author's stance on gun rights, the effectiveness of armed individuals in preventing mass shootings, and the criticism of gun control advocates. I'll make sure to include the moral framing, emphasizing self-defense and the failure of gun laws to stop criminals.

I should structure the summary to start with the incident in Texas, mention the law that enabled the quick response, contrast it with the Democratic approach, provide examples of successful interventions, and conclude with the author's argument against restrictive gun laws. I'll keep the language clear and concise, ensuring the moral perspective is evident.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main arguments and events. Also, I'll make sure to include the comparison to other incidents and the historical reference to strengthen the moral argument.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the author's viewpoint and maintains the moral framing without adding personal opinions. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant, Jack Wilson, a trained and licensed concealed-carry volunteer, swiftly stopped him, preventing a potential mass shooting. This incident highlights the effectiveness of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in places of worship, as enabled by Texas Governor Greg Abbott's law. The author argues that such policies empower individuals to protect themselves and others, contrasting this with the failure of national gun-control measures to stop violent criminals. They criticize gun-control advocates and politicians like Joe Biden for opposing such measures, framing it as an attack on Second Amendment rights and self-defense. The article also references historical examples, such as Israel's self-defense ethos, to emphasize the moral imperative of arming responsible citizens. The author concludes that while no solution is perfect, banning firearms in public spaces creates soft targets, and trained individuals can often prevent or mitigate mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
