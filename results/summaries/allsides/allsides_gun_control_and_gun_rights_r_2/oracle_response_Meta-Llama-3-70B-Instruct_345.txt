SUMMARY: 

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer in mere seconds. This was possible due to a Texas law signed by Governor Greg Abbott, which allows Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship. This move has generated hostility among gun-control advocates, who claim it will inhibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns. However, the author argues that allowing trained and licensed individuals to protect themselves and their community in a place of worship is a constitutional right. The presence of "good guys with guns" can mitigate damage and save lives, as seen in other incidents such as the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring and the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. The author concludes that there is no downside in allowing congregations to govern their own security, and that draconian laws limiting self-defense are offensive.

END OF SUMMARY.
