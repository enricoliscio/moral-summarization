SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped the potential mass murderer. This was possible due to a Texas law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring weapons into places of worship. The author argues that this incident proves that "good guys with guns" can save lives, and that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns can deter or mitigate mass shootings. The author criticizes gun-control advocates who prioritize restricting law-abiding citizens' rights over protecting lives. The article highlights that most mass shootings occur in gun-free zones, and that concealed carriers are among the most law-abiding citizens. The author concludes that allowing congregations to govern their own security can be a lifesaving measure, and that restricting self-defense rights can be particularly harmful for vulnerable communities like Orthodox Jews.

END OF SUMMARY.
