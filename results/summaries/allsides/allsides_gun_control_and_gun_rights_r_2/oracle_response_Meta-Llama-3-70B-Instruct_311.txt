SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer in mere seconds. This was possible due to a Texas law signed by Governor Greg Abbott, which allows people with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship. The law, which has been met with hostility by gun-control advocates, enabled Wilson to protect his community and family. The incident highlights the importance of allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns in places of worship, as they can mitigate damage and stop shooters. The presence of "good guys with guns" can be a deterrent to murderers, who prefer soft targets. The article argues that inhibiting law-abiding citizens from owning guns is not the solution to gun violence, and that the right to self-defense is a fundamental canon in the law of nature.
