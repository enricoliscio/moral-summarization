SUMMARY: In a recent shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, a good guy with a gun, 71-year-old Jack Wilson, saved lives by stopping a potential mass murderer in mere seconds. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms for self-defense. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently signed a bill making it legal for concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship, a move that generated hostility among gun-control advocates. However, as the author points out, most high-profile mass shootings happen in gun-free zones, and the presence of good guys with guns can deter and mitigate the damage inflicted by murderers. While there is no panacea for deranged people committing these acts, allowing congregations to govern their own security and giving people the right to protect themselves and their community is a blessing, as exemplified by the Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky's slogan, "Better to have a gun and not need it than to need it and not have it." This notion was once widely embraced in the United States and still is in Texas.
END OF SUMMARY.
