Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the author's stance.

The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a volunteer with a concealed carry permit. It contrasts this with another incident in New York where Orthodox Jews were attacked without firearms. The author is clearly pro-gun rights, emphasizing how the presence of armed individuals can prevent mass shootings. They criticize gun-control advocates and cite historical examples, like Israel, to support their argument.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry strong positive or negative connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "good," "evil," "tyranny," etc. I'll list each on a new line with a star.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the author's pro-gun rights perspective. I'll focus on the key events, the author's arguments, and the moral implications they highlight.

I need to ensure the summary captures the essence of the article without adding personal opinions, just presenting the facts and the moral framing as presented. I'll structure it to mention the Texas incident, the comparison with New York, the author's criticism of gun laws, and the historical references to emphasize self-defense rights.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial. I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately represents the article's moral stance.

The author contrasts this with restrictive gun laws in places like New York, where Orthodox Jews faced knife attacks without the ability to defend themselves. The article criticizes gun-control advocates, framing their policies as disarming law-abiding citizens while leaving them vulnerable to violence. It draws parallels to historical Jewish self-defense, such as in Israel, to argue for the moral imperative of self-defense. The author suggests that preventing access to firearms for protection is tyrannical and violates fundamental rights, advocating for the freedom to protect oneself and one's community. END OF SUMMARY.
