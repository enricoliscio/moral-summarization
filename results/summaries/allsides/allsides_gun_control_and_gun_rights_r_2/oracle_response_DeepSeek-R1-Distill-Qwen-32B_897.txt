Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a congregant with a gun. The author supports the idea of allowing concealed carry in places of worship, citing this incident and others. They argue against gun control, emphasizing self-defense and the effectiveness of armed individuals in preventing mass shootings.

Next, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "fire," "save," "stop," "legal," "protections," "undeterred," "allowing," "violence," "protect," "shootings," "prefer," "mitigate," "damage," "shot," "dropped," "killed," "compelling," "limitation," "defend," "selfprotection" are central to the moral arguments.

I should structure the summary to highlight the event, the policy that allowed the protection, and the moral stance against restrictive laws. I'll make sure to include the main incidents mentioned, like the church shooting and the comparison with other events in New York and Israel.

I'll start by mentioning the gunman at West Freeway Church and how a congregant stopped him. Then, I'll reference Texas's law allowing concealed carry, contrasting it with New York's restrictions. I'll include the argument that such laws don't prevent determined shooters but allow good Samaritans to act. Finally, I'll touch on the historical context with Israel and the Zionist perspective on self-defense.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but ensure all key points and moral words are included. I'll avoid any markdown and present it clearly after the "SUMMARY:" token.

SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer. Texas law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, allowed licensed concealed carriers to bring firearms into places of worship, enabling Wilson to act. The author argues that such protections save lives and that good guys with guns can mitigate violence, as seen in similar incidents like the First Baptist Church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. The article contrasts this with restrictive gun laws in New York, where Orthodox Jews, targeted by anti-Semitic attacks, are often defenseless. The author emphasizes that allowing trained, law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their communities aligns with the Second Amendment and self-defense rights, citing historical examples like Israel's Zionist movement, which championed armed self-protection. The piece criticizes gun-control advocates for focusing on inhibiting law-abiding citizens rather than addressing the root causes of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
