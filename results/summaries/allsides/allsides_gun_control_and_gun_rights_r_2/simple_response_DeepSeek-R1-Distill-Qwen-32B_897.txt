Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a congregant with a gun. The author supports the idea that allowing trained individuals to carry concealed weapons in places of worship can prevent mass shootings. They contrast this with New York, where Orthodox Jews were attacked with knives because they couldn't have guns. The author also mentions the Texas law allowing concealed carry in churches and criticizes Democrats and the media for opposing such measures. They argue that preventing law-abiding citizens from defending themselves is against the Second Amendment and self-defense rights. The article uses examples from Israel and historical figures like Jabotinsky to emphasize the importance of armed defense. 

I need to capture all these points succinctly, making sure to highlight the moral stance that self-defense and armed protection are crucial, especially in places like churches. I should also note the opposition from gun-control advocates and the contrast between Texas and New York. The summary should be under 200 words and maintain the original's pro-concealed carry and anti-gun control narrative.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked parishioners at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant with a concealed-carry license stopped him, preventing a potential mass shooting. This incident highlights the effectiveness of allowing trained, law-abiding individuals to carry firearms in places of worship, a policy Texas recently legalized. The author argues that such measures save lives, as seen in Texas, while contrasting it with New York, where Orthodox Jews faced a knife-wielding attacker due to strict gun laws. The article criticizes gun-control advocates and Democrats for focusing on inhibiting law-abiding citizens rather than addressing the real issue of deranged individuals committing violence. It emphasizes that the presence of armed citizens can deter or stop shooters, as seen in historical examples like Israel and the U.S. The author advocates for self-defense rights, citing the Second Amendment and the importance of allowing congregations to govern their own security. END OF SUMMARY.
