SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped him with his own gun. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry guns in places of worship. In Texas, a law was signed earlier this year making it legal for people with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into churches. This move has been met with hostility from gun-control advocates, who argue that it will lead to more violence. However, the incident at West Freeway Church of Christ shows that good guys with guns can save lives. The article argues that allowing trained and licensed citizens to carry guns can deter mass shootings and mitigate damage. It also notes that many mass shootings occur in gun-free zones, and that the presence of good guys with guns can dissuade murderers.

END OF SUMMARY.
