SUMMARY:
The recent incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas highlights the importance of good guys with guns in saving lives. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old volunteer security member, stopped a potential mass murderer within seconds. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing licensed Texans to carry concealed weapons into places of worship, despite criticism from gun-control advocates. This bill enabled Wilson to take action and stop the shooter. The argument that guns are rarely effective in stopping mass shootings is misleading, as most high-profile shootings occur in gun-free zones. While there is no panacea for deranged shooters, allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms can provide protection and deter potential attackers. Examples such as the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring and the New Life Church in Colorado Springs demonstrate how armed citizens can mitigate damage and save lives. The right to self-defense is inherent and should be protected, as seen in the state of Israel, where Jews took up arms to defend themselves. The summary concludes by praising Texas for its stance on the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense.
END OF SUMMARY.
