SUMMARY: Good guys with guns can save lives. This was proven in the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, where a gunman opened fire on parishioners, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped him within seconds. Texas law allows licensed individuals to carry concealed weapons into places of worship, and Wilson's quick action demonstrates the importance of such protections. Despite criticism from gun-control advocates, allowing trained and law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their communities is a fundamental right. While there is no easy solution to the problem of deranged individuals committing mass shootings, the argument that guns are ineffective in stopping these events is misleading, as most high-profile shootings occur in gun-free zones. The presence of good guys with guns can also deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. We must learn from history and empower individuals to defend themselves, as seen in the case of Jews in Israel, who no longer ask for permission to exist but take up arms to protect themselves. The right to self-protection is inherent, and Texans continue to embrace this notion.

END OF SUMMARY.
