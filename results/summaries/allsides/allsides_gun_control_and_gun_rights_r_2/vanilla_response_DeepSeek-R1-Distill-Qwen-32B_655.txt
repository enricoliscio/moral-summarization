Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman attacked, and a church member stopped him. The key points are the use of guns by trained individuals to prevent mass shootings, the Texas law allowing concealed carry in places of worship, and the contrast with other incidents where such measures weren't possible. The author argues that allowing responsible gun owners to protect themselves is effective and that current gun laws don't stop mass shooters. They also mention how other groups, like Orthodox Jews, are targeted and can't defend themselves due to strict laws. The conclusion is that the right to self-defense is important and that laws should support this.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main events, the Texas law, the effectiveness of armed citizens, and the comparison to other incidents and groups. I should also mention the author's support for concealed carry laws and their view on the Second Amendment. I need to make sure the summary is clear and captures all the essential points without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant, Jack Wilson, stopped him, highlighting the effectiveness of allowing trained individuals to carry concealed firearms in places of worship. Texas law permits concealed-carry license holders to bring guns to churches, a policy supported by Governor Greg Abbott. Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, used his firearm to prevent a potential mass shooting, demonstrating that responsible gun owners can deter violence. The article contrasts this with incidents like the New York Orthodox Jewish community attack, where victims couldn't use firearms for defense due to strict laws. It argues that gun-free zones make soft targets for shooters and that allowing concealed carriers can save lives. The author emphasizes the importance of self-defense rights, referencing historical examples like Israel's self-defense ethos and advocating for laws that empower citizens to protect themselves. END OF SUMMARY.
