SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped the shooter, likely preventing a mass murder. Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, was able to act quickly because of a Texas law that allows concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship. This incident highlights the effectiveness of "good guys with guns" in stopping mass shooters, contradicting the narrative that gun laws can prevent such tragedies. The article argues that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns in churches and schools can mitigate damage and save lives, and that draconian gun laws can leave citizens defenseless. The incident also draws parallels with the Jewish community's experience, where self-defense has been a crucial aspect of their history.

END OF SUMMARY.
