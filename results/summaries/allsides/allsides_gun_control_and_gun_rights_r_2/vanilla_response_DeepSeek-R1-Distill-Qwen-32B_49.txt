Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this article. Let me read through it again to understand the main points.

The article talks about a recent incident at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas where a gunman attacked parishioners. A 71-year-old man, Jack Wilson, who was a security volunteer and a former deputy sheriff, stopped the gunman. The article mentions that Texas had recently passed a law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring guns into places of worship. This law, according to the author, enabled Wilson to prevent a mass shooting.

The author contrasts this with other incidents, like the ones in New York where Orthodox Jews were attacked with knives because they couldn't use firearms. They argue that allowing trained individuals to carry guns in places of worship can prevent such tragedies, whereas gun-control measures only restrict law-abiding citizens.

The article also criticizes the media and Democratic politicians for opposing such laws, suggesting that their approach doesn't address the real issue of preventing mass shootings. The author references historical examples, like the First Baptist Church in Texas and the New Life Church in Colorado, where armed individuals stopped shooters, to support their argument.

Additionally, the article draws a parallel to Israel's approach to self-defense, emphasizing the importance of the right to bear arms for protection. It concludes by supporting the Texas law and the idea that allowing responsible individuals to carry guns can save lives.

So, the main points are: the Texas church incident, the effectiveness of armed citizens in preventing mass shootings, criticism of gun control policies, historical examples, and the comparison to Israel's self-defense stance. I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key events and arguments presented.
