SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but was swiftly stopped by a congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson. This incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding gun control and the right to self-defense in the United States. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing licensed gun owners to carry their weapons into places of worship. Proponents of the law argue that it empowers law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others, while critics believe it contributes to gun violence. The article emphasizes the rarity of mass shootings being stopped by armed citizens, but also acknowledges the potential for mitigation of damage. The author advocates for the right of congregations to decide on their own security measures, drawing parallels with the state of Israel, where Jews took up arms to defend themselves.
