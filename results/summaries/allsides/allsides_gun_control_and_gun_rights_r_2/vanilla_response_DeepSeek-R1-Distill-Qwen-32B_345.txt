Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman attacked, and a security volunteer stopped him. It mentions the Texas law allowing concealed carry in places of worship, which the author supports. They compare it to other incidents, like the Orthodox Jews in New York, and argue that gun control measures don't prevent mass shootings, while armed citizens can. The author also references historical figures like Jabotinsky to emphasize the right to self-defense.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the incident at West Freeway Church, the role of the security volunteer, the Texas law, the argument against gun control, examples from other shootings, and the comparison to Israel's self-defense stance. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and neutral.

Let me structure it: start with the event, mention the law, the effectiveness of armed citizens, counterarguments, and conclude with the broader debate. I should avoid taking sides but present the arguments as in the article. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked parishioners at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass shooter. Texas law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, allows concealed-carry license holders to bring firearms into places of worship. Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, used his legally carried gun to prevent the attack. The article argues that such laws empower law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others, while gun control measures fail to stop violent individuals. It highlights examples like the Sutherland Springs church shooting, where a congregant used a gun to stop the killer, and contrasts this with restrictive laws in New York, where Orthodox Jews have faced violence without the ability to defend themselves. The piece also draws parallels to Israel's self-defense ethos and criticizes the notion that gun control alone can prevent mass shootings. It concludes that allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in public spaces can deter violence and save lives. END OF SUMMARY.
