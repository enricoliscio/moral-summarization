Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a security volunteer with a concealed-carry license. The author is making a point about gun laws and self-defense.

First, I need to understand the key points. The main event is the church shooting where Jack Wilson stopped the gunman. The article mentions Texas allowing concealed-carry in churches, which the author supports. They contrast this with other incidents where gun-free zones didn't prevent violence. The author also references historical examples like Israel and the Zionist leader Jabotinsky to argue for the right to bear arms.

I should make sure the summary includes the event, the legal context in Texas, the author's argument about the effectiveness of armed citizens, and the moral stance against restrictive gun laws. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all essential elements.

Also, the user wants the summary to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start after "SUMMARY:". I'll structure it to highlight the event, the legal backdrop, the author's argument, and the moral implications, ensuring the framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, swiftly stopped him, preventing a potential massacre. This incident highlights the debate over concealed-carry laws in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had earlier signed a bill allowing Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring firearms into churches, a move that enabled Wilson to act. The author argues that such laws empower law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others, contrasting this with restrictive gun-control measures that leave vulnerable communities defenseless. The article references historical examples, such as Israelâ€™s embrace of self-defense, to emphasize the moral right to bear arms for protection. The author criticizes gun-control advocates for focusing on inhibiting law-abiding citizens rather than addressing the root causes of violence. The summary underscores the moral framing that allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in public spaces can save lives and deter violence, while restrictive laws leave communities vulnerable. END OF SUMMARY.
