Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a churchgoer with a gun. The author uses specific morally charged words, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old with a concealed carry license, who stopped a gunman at his church. The author is arguing in favor of allowing concealed carry in places of worship, referencing Texas's law and contrasting it with other incidents where gun control might have prevented intervention.

I need to identify the morally framed words: fire, save, knife-wielding, targeted, stop, signed, legal, protections, stopped, undeterred, allowing, violence, inhibit, shooting, dead, protect, shootings, prefer, mitigate, damage, shot, dropped, killed, compelling, limitation, defend, self-protection.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with the incident at West Freeway Church of Christ, mention Jack Wilson stopping the gunman. Highlight Texas's law allowing concealed carry, which the author sees as a protection. Compare it to other incidents where lack of firearms led to more casualties. Emphasize the author's support for self-defense and criticism of gun control laws. Conclude with the argument that allowing concealed carry deters violence and protects communities.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll make sure to convey the author's pro-gun stance and the moral implications of allowing or restricting concealed carry in places of worship.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence incorporates the key points and moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure clarity.

SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old congregant, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer with a legally carried firearm. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had signed a law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring guns into places of worship, a move that generated hostility among gun-control advocates. Wilson, a former deputy sheriff, exemplifies how trained and licensed individuals can protect themselves and others. The author argues that allowing such protections saves lives and mitigates damage, as seen in other incidents like the Sutherland Spring and New Life Church shootings. Gun-free zones, however, make soft targets for shooters, and restrictive laws in places like New York leave communities defenseless. The author highlights the moral imperative of self-defense, drawing parallels to Israelâ€™s Zionist history of arming for protection. By contrast, Draconian gun laws inhibit law-abiding citizens from defending themselves, creating a dangerous limitation on self-protection. The author concludes that allowing concealed carry in places of worship is a moral and practical choice to defend against violence. END OF SUMMARY.
