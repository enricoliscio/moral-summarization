SUMMARY:
In a heroic display, a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped a potential mass murderer at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas. This was made possible by a Texas law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship. The "good guy with a gun" took mere seconds to stop the shooter, saving countless lives. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their communities. In contrast, "draconian laws" in states like New York make it impossible for people to practice their right to self-defense. The author argues that allowing citizens to carry guns can mitigate damage and even prevent mass shootings, citing examples of successful interventions. This incident is a testament to the power of self-defense and the importance of preserving the Second Amendment. END OF SUMMARY.
