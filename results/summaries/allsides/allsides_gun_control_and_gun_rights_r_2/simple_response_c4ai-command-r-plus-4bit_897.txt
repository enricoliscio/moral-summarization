SUMMARY: Good guys with guns can save lives, as was proven in the recent shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old volunteer security guard, was able to stop a potential mass shooting in mere seconds. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms for self-defense, especially in places of worship and schools. While there is no easy solution to the problem of deranged people carrying out mass shootings, the argument that guns rarely stop these events is misleading. Most mass shootings happen in gun-free zones, and concealed carriers are law-abiding citizens who can help mitigate the damage inflicted by murderers. The presence of good guys with guns can also serve as a deterrent to potential shooters, who prefer soft targets. The right to self-defense is a fundamental principle, and allowing congregations to govern their own security gives them the power to protect themselves. This is especially important for groups that have historically been targets of violence, such as Jews. The state of Israel is a testament to the power of self-defense, and the right to bear arms should be embraced as a means of protecting oneself and others.

END OF SUMMARY.
