SUMMARY: In December 2019, a gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas. Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, quickly took action and stopped the potential mass murderer within seconds. This incident highlighted the ongoing debate about gun control and the right to self-defense in the United States. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship. Proponents of the law argue that it enables law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others in the event of an attack. Critics, including Democratic-party front-runner Joe Biden, have called such laws "irrational." The article emphasizes that there is no easy solution to the problem of deranged people carrying out mass shootings, but allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry firearms can potentially mitigate the damage inflicted by murderers. The author also notes that certain religious groups, such as Orthodox Jews and Mormons, have differing views on the role of firearms in self-defense. Finally, the article concludes by referencing the Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky's famous quote advocating for self-defense through armament.
END OF SUMMARY.
