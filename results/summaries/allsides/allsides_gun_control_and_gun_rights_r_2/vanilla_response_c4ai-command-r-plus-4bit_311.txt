SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but was quickly stopped by a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson. This incident highlights the ongoing debate about gun control and the right to self-defense in the US. Texas governor Greg Abbott had previously signed a bill allowing Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into places of worship. Proponents of this law argue that it empowers law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others, while gun-control advocates believe it puts people at risk. The article also mentions other incidents where good guys with guns have stopped mass shooters, such as the shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, and the case of Jeanne Assam at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. The author argues that allowing congregations to govern their own security is preferable to draconian gun control laws that leave people defenseless. This is especially relevant for Orthodox Jews, who have recently been the target of violent attacks. The article concludes by quoting the Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who advocated for Jews to arm themselves for self-defense.
END OF SUMMARY.
