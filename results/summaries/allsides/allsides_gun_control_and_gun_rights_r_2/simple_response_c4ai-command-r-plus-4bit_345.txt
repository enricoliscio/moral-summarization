SUMMARY: Good guys with guns save lives, as proven in the recent incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, where a gunman was stopped by a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson. Despite criticism from gun-control advocates, allowing law-abiding citizens to carry weapons can help prevent mass shootings and protect innocent lives. Texas governor Greg Abbott faced backlash for signing a bill allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship, but such measures can save lives, as seen in the Texas church shooting. The argument that guns rarely stop mass shootings is misleading, as most of these incidents occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of good guys with guns can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage inflicted. While the chances of being caught in a mass shooting are rare, there is no downside to allowing congregations to govern their own security. The right to self-defense is inherent, as emphasized by John Adams and Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Banning firearms in places of worship leaves people defenseless, as seen in the recent attacks on Orthodox Jews in New York. Texans have recognized the importance of arming themselves for self-protection, a right that should be cherished and protected.
END OF SUMMARY.
