Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article discusses a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a congregant with a gun, highlighting the effectiveness of allowing concealed carry in places of worship. The author contrasts this with other incidents where knife-wielding attackers targeted Jewish communities and argues against strict gun laws, emphasizing self-defense rights.

First, I'll identify the key points: the incident at West Freeway Church, the Texas law allowing concealed carry, the comparison to other attacks, and the argument for self-defense. I need to use the morally framed words provided, such as "fire," "save," "stop," "legal," "protections," etc.

I'll start by outlining the main events and the author's stance. I should mention the gunman, the congregant who stopped him, the Texas law, and the effectiveness of allowing concealed carry. Then, I'll touch on the contrast with other incidents and the author's criticism of gun-control advocates.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral terms as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the positive outcome of having a concealed carrier and the negative implications of restrictive gun laws, using the provided words to maintain the moral tone.

Finally, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved without adding personal opinions beyond what's in the article.

SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a congregant, Jack Wilson, stopped the potential mass murderer with his concealed firearm. This incident highlights the effectiveness of allowing trained, licensed individuals to carry guns in places of worship, as per Texas law signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The author contrasts this with other attacks, such as the knife-wielding anti-Semitic attacker in New York, where the lack of armed defense left victims vulnerable. The article argues that gun-control advocates focus on inhibiting law-abiding citizens rather than addressing the real issue of deranged individuals committing violence. The author emphasizes that allowing good guys with guns can save lives, as seen in cases like Wilsonâ€™s, and that such protections do not force churches to arm themselves but provide an option for self-defense. The piece also draws parallels to Jewish history, noting the importance of self-protection, as seen in Israel, and criticizes restrictive gun laws that leave communities defenseless. END OF SUMMARY.
