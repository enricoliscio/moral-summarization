SUMMARY:
In the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, a gunman was stopped by a "good guy with a gun," 71-year-old Jack Wilson, a security volunteer and former deputy sheriff. This heroic act was made possible by a Texas law that allows concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship. The author argues that this law, which was signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is a "primary canon in the law of nature" that allows law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their community. In contrast, the author criticizes "irrational" and "draconian" gun control laws that inhibit self-defense and create "soft targets" for mass shooters. The article highlights the importance of allowing citizens to defend themselves, citing examples of successful interventions by armed congregants. END OF SUMMARY.
