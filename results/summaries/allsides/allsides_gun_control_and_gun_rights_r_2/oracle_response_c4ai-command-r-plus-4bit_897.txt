SUMMARY: Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old security volunteer at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, stopped a potential mass shooting within seconds. This incident highlights the ongoing debate about gun control and the right to self-defense. Texas governor Greg Abbott previously signed a bill allowing licensed gun carriers to bring their weapons into places of worship, a move that was criticized by gun-control advocates and the media. However, Wilson's quick response demonstrates the potential lifesaving benefits of such laws. While there is no easy solution to the issue of mass shootings, the argument that guns are ineffective in stopping these events is misleading, as most mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. Additionally, the presence of good guys with guns can deter potential shooters and mitigate the damage they inflict. The article also notes the importance of allowing congregations to decide their own security measures and the right to self-defense, a right that Jews in particular should find especially important given their history of persecution.

END OF SUMMARY.
