SUMMARY:

A recent shooting at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas was stopped by a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson, who was able to carry a gun into the church due to a Texas law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring weapons into places of worship. This heroic act highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and their communities. The author argues that gun-control advocates often prioritize inhibiting citizens' right to own guns over protecting lives. The article cites examples of successful interventions by armed citizens, including a 2007 incident at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, and notes that most high-profile mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. The author concludes that allowing congregations to govern their own security can be a lifesaving measure, and that restricting citizens' right to self-defense is a misguided approach. END OF SUMMARY.
