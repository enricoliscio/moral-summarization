SUMMARY:

A recent incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas highlights the importance of allowing good guys with guns to save lives. A 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, stopped a potential mass murderer in mere seconds, thanks to a Texas law that permits concealed-carry license holders to bring their weapons into places of worship. This move has been met with hostility from gun-control advocates, who prioritize inhibiting law-abiding citizens from owning guns over protecting lives. The author argues that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns can mitigate damage and even stop mass shootings, as seen in other incidents such as the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring and the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. The limitation on self-defense, particularly in places like New York, is seen as a threat to the right to exist and defend oneself, especially for targeted communities like Orthodox Jews. By allowing congregations to govern their own security, we can prioritize protecting lives over restricting gun ownership.

END OF SUMMARY.
