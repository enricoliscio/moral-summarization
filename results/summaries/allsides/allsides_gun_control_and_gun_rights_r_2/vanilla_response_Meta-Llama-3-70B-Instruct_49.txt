SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, quickly stopped the shooter, potentially saving lives. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had signed a bill making it legal for Texans with concealed-carry licenses to bring their weapons into churches, which allowed Wilson to take action. The article argues that "good guys with guns" can save lives and that gun-free zones often become targets for mass shooters. It also criticizes Democrats' pursuit of stricter gun laws, saying they would only inhibit law-abiding citizens from owning guns. The article concludes that allowing trained and licensed individuals to carry guns in churches can mitigate damage and save lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
