SUMMARY:

A recent shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas was stopped by a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, who was able to carry a gun into the church due to a Texas law allowing concealed-carry license holders to bring weapons into places of worship. This incident highlights the importance of allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and their communities. The author argues that gun-control advocates often prioritize restricting gun ownership over protecting lives, and that "good guys with guns" can indeed save lives. The article also notes that most high-profile mass shootings occur in gun-free zones, and that the presence of concealed carriers can deter or mitigate damage from potential shooters. The author concludes that allowing congregations to govern their own security can be a lifesaving measure, and that restricting self-defense rights can be particularly harmful to vulnerable communities, such as Orthodox Jews in New York.

END OF SUMMARY.
