Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about a church in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a security volunteer with a gun. The author supports the idea of allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in places of worship, citing examples where this has prevented mass shootings. He contrasts this with restrictive laws in other areas, like New York, where such measures aren't allowed, leading to defenselessness. The moral argument here is about self-defense rights and the effectiveness of armed security versus gun control laws. I should make sure the summary captures the pro-gun stance and the examples given, as well as the criticism of restrictive laws. I'll keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, highlighting the key points without losing the author's perspective.

SUMMARY: A gunman attacked parishioners at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, but a 71-year-old security volunteer, Jack Wilson, swiftly stopped him, highlighting the effectiveness of allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott had earlier signed a bill permitting concealed-carry license holders to bring guns to churches, a move criticized by gun-control advocates. The author argues that such laws enable law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others, as seen in instances like Wilson's actions, and contrasts this with restrictive laws in other areas, such as New York, where Orthodox Jews have faced violence without the ability to defend themselves. The article emphasizes the moral right to self-defense, drawing parallels to historical Jewish self-defense movements, and criticizes gun-control measures as ineffective and unjust. It concludes that allowing trained individuals to carry firearms in places of worship is a reasonable and effective approach to preventing mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
