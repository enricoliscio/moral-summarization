Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a church in Texas where a gunman attacked, and a congregant with a concealed carry license stopped him. It mentions how Texas law allows concealed firearms in places of worship, which the author credits with saving lives. They contrast this with New York where Orthodox Jews were attacked with knives, highlighting the difference in outcomes when firearms are involved.

The author also talks about the political response, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott supporting the law, while Democrats like Joe Biden oppose it. They argue that allowing trained individuals to carry guns in churches is effective against mass shooters, who often target gun-free zones. The article uses examples from other shootings where armed individuals stopped the attackers.

The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the incident, the Texas law, the comparison with New York, the political debate, and the argument about the effectiveness of armed citizens in preventing mass shootings.

I should make sure to include the key details without getting bogged down in the author's opinions beyond what's necessary. Also, mention the examples like Sutherland Spring and Colorado Springs to illustrate the argument.

Let me structure it: start with the Texas church incident, mention the law, contrast with New York, discuss the political divide, and conclude with the argument that armed citizens can prevent such attacks.

I need to keep it concise, so each sentence should cover one main point without extra details.

Wait, I should also mention that the author argues against gun control measures, emphasizing self-defense rights. That's important for the summary.

Let me draft it:

"In Texas, a congregant stopped a gunman at a church, thanks to a law allowing concealed firearms. This contrasts with New York's knife attack on Orthodox Jews, where no firearms were involved. The author credits the Texas law for preventing a mass shooting and criticizes Democratic opposition, arguing that armed citizens can stop shooters. Examples from other incidents support this view, showing that armed individuals can prevent or mitigate mass shootings. The article emphasizes the right to self-defense and the ineffectiveness of gun-free zones against determined attackers."

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down to under 200 words, ensuring each point is clear without being too wordy.

Final summary should include: Texas church incident, the law allowing concealed carry, contrast with New York, political opposition, examples of successful interventions, and the argument for armed defense.
