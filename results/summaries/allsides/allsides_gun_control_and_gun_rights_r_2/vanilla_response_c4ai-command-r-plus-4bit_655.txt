SUMMARY: An article highlights the role of good guys with guns in saving lives, specifically mentioning the incident at the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas where a gunman was stopped by a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer, Jack Wilson. The article argues that laws allowing licensed individuals to carry concealed firearms in places of worship can help stop mass shooters. It criticizes gun-control advocates who oppose such laws and argues that most mass shootings happen in gun-free zones. The article also mentions other incidents where good guys with guns have stopped or mitigated the damage inflicted by murderers, such as the shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Spring, Texas, and the case of Jeanne Assam at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. It advocates for the right to self-defense and the ability for congregations to govern their own security, while also acknowledging that some religious groups, like the Mormon Church, have banned firearms from their places of worship. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the right to self-protection, especially for groups that have historically been targets of violence, such as Jews.
