Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The Justice Department issued a legal opinion saying McGahn can't be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent. Trump's administration is arguing this is to protect future presidents, but critics see it as obstruction of justice.

I should note the main elements: Trump's action, the legal basis, the criticism from Democrats like Nadler and Cicilline, and the potential for impeachment. Also, the context of the Mueller report and McGahn's role in it is important.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral implications. The user wants the moral framing preserved, so I should highlight the conflict between executive privilege and accountability, as well as the criticism that Trump is obstructing justice.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's action, mention the legal opinion, then the criticism, and the potential consequences like impeachment. Also, include McGahn's role in the Mueller report to show why his testimony is significant.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, but ensure the moral angle is clear. That means emphasizing the clash between protecting the presidency and the need for transparency and accountability.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure it's clear and flows well, capturing all essential points without getting too detailed.

Okay, I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the Mueller report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, who was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. Trump defended the move, stating it was for the office of the presidency, not himself. Critics, including Democratic leaders like Jerry Nadler and David Cicilline, accused Trump of obstructing justice and called the action a "disdain for the law." Cicilline warned that failing to compel McGahn's testimony could warrant an impeachment inquiry. McGahn, a key figure in the Mueller report, reportedly resisted Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, including threatening to resign if Mueller was fired. The move is part of the Trump administration's pattern of blocking congressional oversight, raising concerns about accountability and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
