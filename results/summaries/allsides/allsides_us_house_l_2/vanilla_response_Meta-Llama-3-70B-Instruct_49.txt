SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn cannot be forced to testify, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." This move has been criticized by Democrats, with Jerry Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, condemning the administration's "disdain for the law." Nadler threatened to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress if he did not meet a second deadline to appear before the committee. Another Democratic member, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment of Trump would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to block congressional oversight.

END OF SUMMARY.
