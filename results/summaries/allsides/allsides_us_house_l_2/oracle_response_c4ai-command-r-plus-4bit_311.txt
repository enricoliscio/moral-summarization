SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. This move has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment, with some arguing that Trump is obstructing justice and impeding the truth. 

The justice department's legal opinion states that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, and the White House has directed him to act accordingly. This intervention has been condemned by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, who stated that the Mueller report documents a shocking pattern of obstruction of justice by the president. Nadler argues that Trump does not want the American people to hear firsthand about his alleged misconduct. 

The Trump administration has a history of blocking attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House, and this latest move has been described as a disdain for the law. Some have suggested that impeachment proceedings should be opened if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. 

The justice department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying if he chooses to do so, but he would potentially risk his career. The White House's actions have been interpreted as an effort to execute presidential responsibilities and protect future presidents.

END OF SUMMARY.
