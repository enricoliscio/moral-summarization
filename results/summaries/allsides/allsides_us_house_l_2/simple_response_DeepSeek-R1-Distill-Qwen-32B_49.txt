Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Trump is preventing McGahn from testifying, which is causing criticism and even talk of impeachment. The Justice Department says it's based on constitutional precedent, protecting future presidents. McGahn is important because he was involved in Mueller's report, resisting Trump's orders. Trump claims it's about the presidency, not himself. Critics, like Nadler and Cicilline, argue this shows obstruction and call for impeachment. The summary needs to highlight the conflict between executive privilege and congressional oversight, emphasizing the moral issues like undermining democracy and the rule of law.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the essence of the moral arguments on both sides. I'll structure it to mention Trump's actions, the legal reasoning, McGahn's role, the criticism, and the potential for impeachment. That should cover the main points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the Mueller report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and impeachment threats. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, who was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify under oath, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. McGahn, a key figure in the Mueller report, resisted Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, including refusing to fire Mueller and attempting to convince Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Trump defended the decision, stating it was for the office of the presidency, while critics accused him of obstructing justice and undermining democracy. Democratic leaders, including Jerry Nadler and David Cicilline, condemned the move, with Cicilline warning that failing to compel McGahn's testimony could warrant impeachment. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict between executive privilege and congressional oversight, with critics arguing that Trump's actions erode the rule of law and democratic norms. END OF SUMMARY.
