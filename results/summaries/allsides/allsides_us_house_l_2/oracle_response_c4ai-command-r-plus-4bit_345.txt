SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The move has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment, with some arguing that Trump is obstructing justice and impeding the investigation. 

In a legal opinion, the Justice Department stated that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to testify, and the White House directed him to refuse to answer questions. This intervention has been condemned as an example of the Trump administration's disdain for the law, with Democratic lawmakers arguing that McGahn's testimony is crucial as he personally witnessed the president's alleged misconduct and efforts to obstruct justice. 

The committee subpoenaing McGahn still expects him to appear, despite the White House's instruction, and has threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress if he does not. The Trump administration has a history of blocking attempts at oversight, and some believe that impeachment may be warranted if McGahn does not testify. This incident is the latest in a series of efforts by the administration to impede the investigation and block the collection of evidence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
