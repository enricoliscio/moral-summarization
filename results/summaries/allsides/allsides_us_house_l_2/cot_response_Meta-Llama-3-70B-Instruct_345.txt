SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law" and an attempt to "impede" the collection of evidence. McGahn is a central figure in the report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. Democrats condemned the move, with Jerry Nadler saying it's part of a "shocking pattern of obstruction of justice" and David Cicilline suggesting that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn didn't respond to the subpoena. The Trump administration has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight, showing a blatant disregard for the "law" and the "truth". END OF SUMMARY.
