SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, prompting sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The justice department claims lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that Trump is engaged in an ongoing effort to impede their ability to find the truth and collect evidence, with Jerry Nadler condemning the move as a "disdain for the law." Nadler warned that if McGahn doesn't testify, it may be time to open an impeachment inquiry, as Trump's actions amount to obstruction of justice. David Cicilline echoed this sentiment, stating that no one is above the law, including the president. The Trump administration's repeated attempts to block oversight and ignore subpoenas have sparked outrage, with many calling for accountability and transparency.
