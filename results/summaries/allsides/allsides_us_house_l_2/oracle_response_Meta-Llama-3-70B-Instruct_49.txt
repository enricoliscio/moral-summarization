SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department claims that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that this move is an attempt to obstruct justice and protect Trump from accountability for his alleged misconduct.

The White House's intervention has been condemned as a "disdain for the law" and an "effort to impede" the truth. McGahn's testimony is crucial, as he personally witnessed Trump's attempts to obstruct justice. If McGahn does not respond to the subpoena, some Democrats are calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.

This move is part of a pattern of obstruction and interference by the Trump administration, which has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House. The administration's actions have been labeled a "cancer on the presidency," and critics argue that no one, including the President, is above the law.
