SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, citing executive privilege. The move has sparked criticism and threats of impeachment from Democrats, who argue that McGahn's testimony is crucial to understanding Trump's alleged obstruction of justice. The White House's intervention was condemned by Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, who called the move the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings could be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena. The justice department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by doing so. This action is the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to block congressional oversight attempts by the Democratic-controlled House.
END OF SUMMARY.
