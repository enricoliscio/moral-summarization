SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, a move that has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The justice department's legal opinion states that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, with the White House arguing that this action is necessary to protect the office of the presidency for future presidents. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report and is said to have prevented Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, has condemned the White House's intervention, stating that the report documents a shocking pattern of obstruction of justice by the president. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings should be initiated if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The Trump administration has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight and refused to comply with subpoenas, demonstrating a disdain for the law and efforts to impede the truth.
