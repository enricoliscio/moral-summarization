SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking outrage and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department claims that McGahn cannot be forced to testify, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that this move is a blatant attempt to obstruct justice and hide the truth about Trump's alleged misconduct. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to fire Mueller. The White House's intervention has been condemned by Democratic lawmakers, who accuse Trump of having "disdain for the law" and attempting to impede their ability to find the truth. Some Democrats are even calling for impeachment proceedings if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as a brazen attempt to undermine the rule of law and protect Trump's own interests.
