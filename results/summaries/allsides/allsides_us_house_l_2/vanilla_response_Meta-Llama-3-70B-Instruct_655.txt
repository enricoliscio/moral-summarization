SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn cannot be forced to testify, citing constitutional precedent. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to fire Mueller. The move has been condemned by Democrats, with Jerry Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, accusing Trump of trying to block McGahn from speaking about his alleged misconduct. Another Democratic member, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena. The White House's intervention has been criticized as an example of the administration's "disdain for the law".
