SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department claims that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent". This move has been sharply criticized by Democrats, who argue that it is an attempt to obstruct justice and protect Trump from accountability. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to fire Mueller. Trump's actions have been condemned as a "disdain for the law" and an attempt to hide his alleged misconduct from the American people. Democrats have threatened impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as part of a broader pattern of obstruction by the Trump administration, which has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.
