SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, prompting sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The Justice Department claims lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that Trump's move is an effort to obstruct justice and protect himself from federal law enforcement. McGahn, a central figure in the Mueller report, witnessed Trump's alleged misconduct and was instructed by the White House to defy a congressional subpoena. The Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, condemned the move, saying it shows the Trump administration's "disdain for the law." Another Democrat, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena, as Trump has engaged in an ongoing effort to impede the collection of evidence and truth.
