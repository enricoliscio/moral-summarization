SUMMARY:
The White House has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and threats of impeachment. The move has been interpreted as contempt for Congress and a potential obstruction of justice. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, who reportedly stood in the way of Trump's efforts to commit alleged injustices. The Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, condemned the White House's intervention, stating that McGahn personally witnessed the most egregious acts of obstruction of justice by the president. He further emphasized that Trump is attempting to impede the truth and protect himself from federal law enforcement. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, went as far as to suggest that impeachment proceedings should be initiated if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The justice department's legal opinion allows McGahn to testify at his own risk, but Trump has threatened to direct Republicans to cease dealing with his law firm. This incident is the latest example of the Trump administration's disdain for the law and its repeated blocking of attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.
