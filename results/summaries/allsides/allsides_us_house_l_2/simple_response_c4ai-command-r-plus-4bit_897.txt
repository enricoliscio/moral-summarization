SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking outrage and even calls for impeachment. The move has been interpreted as the latest example of Trump's administration's disdain for the law and obstruction of justice.

The justice department's legal opinion, which directed McGahn to refrain from testifying, was criticized by Democratic lawmakers, including Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee. Nadler stated that the Mueller report exposed a shocking pattern of obstruction of justice by the president, and that McGahn, who personally witnessed Trump's most egregious acts, must testify.

Another Democrat, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings should be initiated if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. He argued that Trump has consistently impeded Congress' ability to uncover the truth and that no one, including the president, is above the law.

Trump's interference in the matter is indicative of his disregard for the integrity of the presidency and the rule of law. It remains to be seen whether McGahn will defy the White House and testify, but the incident underscores the urgent need to hold the president accountable for his actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
