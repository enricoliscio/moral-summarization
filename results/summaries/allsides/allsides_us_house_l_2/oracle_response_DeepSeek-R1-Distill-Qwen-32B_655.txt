Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The user has already provided a summary, but I need to make sure I understand the process and maybe improve it.

First, I should read the article carefully to grasp the main points. Trump is preventing McGahn from testifying, which is causing a lot of criticism, including threats of impeachment. The Justice Department is backing Trump, saying it's based on legal precedents. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, involved in obstruction of justice. The White House claims it's to protect future presidents, but Democrats are upset, seeing it as undermining the law and Congress's oversight. They might push for impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. The list includes words like "blocked," "interference," "compel," etc. The previous summary did a good job, but maybe I can make it a bit more concise or ensure all key points are covered without exceeding 200 words.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Trump and Congress, the legal stance, McGahn's role, and the potential consequences like impeachment. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear, using words that convey obstruction, interference, and the potential for impeachment.

I think the previous summary is solid, but perhaps I can tweak it a bit for clarity or to include more of the moral terms. For example, emphasizing that Trump's action is seen as a "disdain for the law" and an "obstruction of justice." Also, making sure to mention that the Justice Department's opinion doesn't prevent McGahn from testifying, but it's a risk for his career.

I should also note the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Congress, with other instances like blocking testimony and refusing to comply with subpoenas, which shows a pattern of "disdain for the law."

Putting it all together, I'll aim for a concise summary that hits all these points, using the morally framed words to convey the tension and implications.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. Trump claimed the move was for the office of the presidency, not for himself. McGahn, a central figure in Robert Mueller’s report, was involved in obstructing justice, including resisting Trump’s orders to fire Mueller. Democrats, like Jerry Nadler and David Cicilline, condemned Trump’s actions as an obstruction of justice and a disdain for the law, with Cicilline suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn’t testify. The Justice Department’s opinion allows McGahn to testify voluntarily but at career risk. Trump’s administration has repeatedly blocked congressional oversight, including refusing to comply with subpoenas for tax returns and other evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
