SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, prompting sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". McGahn is a central figure in the report, often standing in the way of Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The president's actions have been condemned by Democratic lawmakers, who accuse him of engaging in a "shocking pattern of obstruction of justice" and "alleged misconduct". Trump's move is seen as an attempt to protect himself from federal law enforcement, with one lawmaker suggesting that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena. The incident has sparked outrage, with one former justice department official calling it a "cancer on the presidency".
