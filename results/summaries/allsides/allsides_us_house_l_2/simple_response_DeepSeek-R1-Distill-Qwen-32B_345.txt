Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. So, I should focus on the key points and the underlying moral implications presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. It's about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress regarding the Mueller report. The Justice Department is backing Trump's decision, citing legal precedents to protect the presidency. Critics, especially Democrats, are accusing Trump of obstructing justice and undermining Congress. There are threats of impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify.

I need to highlight the conflict between executive privilege and congressional oversight. The moral framing here is about the balance of power and accountability. Trump's actions are seen as an overreach, while his administration argues it's for the integrity of the presidency.

I should mention the key players: Trump, McGahn, the Justice Department, and the Democratic leaders like Nadler and Cicilline. Also, note the legal opinion and the potential consequences like impeachment.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points without getting too detailed. The summary should reflect the tension and the moral arguments from both sides.

Let me structure it: start with Trump blocking McGahn, the legal basis, the criticism from Democrats, the potential for impeachment, and the broader implications for checks and balances.

Make sure to include that McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, which adds weight to the criticism. Also, mention that the Justice Department's stance is to protect future presidents, but critics see it as Trump protecting himself.

Finally, ensure the summary ends with the implications for the balance of power and accountability in government.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the Mueller report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, who was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify under oath, citing constitutional precedent to protect the presidency. Critics, including Democratic leaders like Jerry Nadler and David Cicilline, accused Trump of obstructing justice and undermining congressional oversight. Cicilline warned that failing to compel McGahn's testimony could warrant impeachment. McGahn, a key figure in the Mueller report, reportedly opposed Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, including resisting orders to fire Mueller and urging Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Trump defended the decision, framing it as protecting future presidents, but critics see it as an overreach. The standoff highlights the ongoing tension between executive privilege and congressional accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
