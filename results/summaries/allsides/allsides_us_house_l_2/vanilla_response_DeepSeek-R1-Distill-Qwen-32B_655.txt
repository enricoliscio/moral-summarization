Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump has blocked McGahn from testifying about the Mueller report on Russian election interference. There's criticism and even threats of impeachment. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn can't be compelled to testify because of constitutional precedent. The White House says this is to protect future presidents. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, as he tried to stop Trump from obstructing justice, like threatening to resign if Mueller was fired.

Trump defended the decision, saying it's for the office of the presidency, not for himself. Democrats, like Nadler and Cicilline, are criticizing this move, calling it an attack on the rule of law and suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The Justice Department's opinion doesn't force McGahn to testify but could risk his career. Trump also mentioned possibly cutting ties with his law firm if McGahn testifies. McGahn was subpoenaed but hasn't appeared yet, with deadlines approaching. The article also mentions other instances where the Trump admin has blocked testimony, like Carl Kline and Steven Mnuchin refusing to comply with subpoenas.

So, the key points are: Trump blocking McGahn, legal opinion from Justice, criticism from Democrats, potential impeachment, McGahn's role in Mueller report, Trump's defense, and other instances of blocking testimony.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting these points clearly.
