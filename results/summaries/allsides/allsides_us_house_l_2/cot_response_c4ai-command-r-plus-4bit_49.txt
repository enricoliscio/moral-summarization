SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has blocked Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and threats of impeachment. The justice department's legal opinion states that McGahn cannot be compelled to answer questions under oath, citing long-standing precedent for the office of the presidency. This move has been condemned by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, who called it another example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". McGahn is a key figure in Robert Mueller's report, having witnessed and impeded Trump's attempts to obstruct justice. Despite the White House intervention, Nadler's committee still expects McGahn to appear at a hearing on Tuesday morning. The move has also sparked discussions about impeachment, with some Democrats arguing that Trump's ongoing impediments to Congressional oversight warrant the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry. The justice department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying voluntarily, but he risks his career by doing so. Trump's administration has a history of blocking attempts at oversight, including refusing to provide tax returns and security clearance information. The committee has previously voted to hold the attorney general, William Barr, in contempt for refusing to provide the unredacted Mueller report.
END OF SUMMARY.
