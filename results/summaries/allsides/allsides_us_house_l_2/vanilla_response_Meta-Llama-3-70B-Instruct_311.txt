SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent". McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. Democrats have criticized the move, with Jerry Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, accusing Trump of trying to block McGahn's testimony to protect himself from alleged misconduct. David Cicilline, another Democratic member, suggested that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law".
