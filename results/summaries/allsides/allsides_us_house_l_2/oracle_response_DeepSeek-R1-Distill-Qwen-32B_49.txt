Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The Justice Department says McGahn can't be compelled to testify, citing legal precedents. Trump's team argues it's to protect future presidents, but critics see it as obstruction of justice. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, which details Trump's attempts to obstruct justice. Nadler and Cicilline are criticizing Trump, with Cicilline even suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The article also mentions other instances where the Trump admin has blocked oversight, like refusing to hand over tax returns.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They include blocked, interference, compel, forced, execute, efforts, obstruct, justice, investigation, doing, intervention, obstruction, acted, criminally, acts, misconduct, move, disdain, impeachment, engaged, effort, impede, truth, evidence, work, above, inquiry, cancer, instruction, hold, oversight, instructed, lapses, refused, refusing.

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: Trump blocking McGahn, the Justice Department's legal opinion, the reason given, the implications, McGahn's role, the criticism from Democrats, the threat of impeachment, and other instances of blocking oversight.

I need to structure this concisely, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate. For example, using "blocked," "compel," "obstruct," "justice," "misconduct," "impeachment," etc. I'll also mention the legal opinion, the White House's stance, and the consequences if McGahn doesn't testify.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to hit all these points while keeping it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to see if it includes the necessary moral terms and flows logically.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. Trump claimed the move was for the office of the presidency, not himself. McGahn, a key figure in Robert Mueller's report, was central to Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, including threatening to fire Mueller and urging Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself. Critics, including Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler, condemned the move as an obstruction of justice and an attempt to hide Trump's alleged misconduct. Nadler threatened contempt of Congress if McGahn did not appear. Democratic member David Cicilline suggested impeachment if McGahn did not testify, calling Trump's actions an effort to impede oversight. The move reflects the administration's disdain for the law, with McGahn potentially risking his career by testifying. The Justice Department's stance does not prevent McGahn from choosing to testify. Trump's administration has repeatedly blocked oversight, including refusing to hand over tax returns and other evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
