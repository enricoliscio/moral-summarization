SUMMARY: Donald Trump blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, a move that has sparked sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The justice department argued that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn, who was subpoenaed, to testify under oath. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, claimed that this action was taken to protect the office of the presidency for future presidents.

McGahn is a key figure in Robert Mueller's report, as he is said to have prevented Trump from obstructing justice on several occasions. Despite the White House's intervention, the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, has condemned the move and stated that McGahn must still appear before the committee. He described the Trump administration's actions as showing a "disdain for the law". Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings could be warranted if McGahn does not testify.

The justice department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by doing so. Trump has previously threatened to instruct Republicans to cease dealing with McGahn's law firm. This incident is the latest example of the Trump administration's obstruction of attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.

END OF SUMMARY.
