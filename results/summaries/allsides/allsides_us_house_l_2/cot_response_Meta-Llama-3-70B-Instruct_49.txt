SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has sparked outrage by blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The move has been condemned as a "shocking" attempt to obstruct justice and protect the President from accountability. The President's actions have been deemed "criminal" by some, and the administration's "disdain for the law" has been criticized. McGahn, a central figure in the Mueller report, had threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. The President's efforts to block McGahn's testimony have been seen as an attempt to hide his "alleged misconduct" from the American people. Democrats have vowed to take action, with some calling for impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The standoff has been characterized as a "cancer on the presidency" that must be addressed. END OF SUMMARY.
