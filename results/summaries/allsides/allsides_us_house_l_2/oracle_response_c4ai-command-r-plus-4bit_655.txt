SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. This has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment, as McGahn is a central figure in the report and was often an obstacle to Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The justice department's legal opinion states that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, and the White House has directed him to act accordingly, claiming that it is necessary to ensure future presidents can effectively execute their responsibilities. The move has been condemned as an intervention that demonstrates the Trump administration's disdain for the law, with the House judiciary committee still expecting McGahn to appear as scheduled. The committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, has threatened to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress if he does not meet the deadline. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings could be warranted if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The Trump administration has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight and refused to comply with subpoenas, leading to growing calls for accountability and concerns about the integrity of the presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
