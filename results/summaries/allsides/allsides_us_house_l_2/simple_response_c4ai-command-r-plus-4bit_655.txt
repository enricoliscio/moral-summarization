SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, marking the latest example of the administration's disdain for the law and prompting calls for impeachment. The move was criticized by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, who stated that McGahn personally witnessed the president's most egregious acts of obstruction of justice. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings should be initiated if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The justice department's legal opinion, while not preventing McGahn from testifying, underscores the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to impede oversight and accountability. This incident adds to a pattern of obstruction and disregard for the rule of law, with the administration repeatedly blocking attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.
END OF SUMMARY.
