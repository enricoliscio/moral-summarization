SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, marking the latest example of the administration's disdain for the law. The move has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment, with the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, condemning the intervention as an attempt to hide "alleged misconduct". McGahn, a central figure in the Mueller report, threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired and was dispatched to convince the former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, not to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. The justice department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would be risking his career to do so. Trump's action has been criticized as an obstruction of justice and an abuse of power, with one Democratic member of the judiciary committee suggesting that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. This incident is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration blocking attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.
END OF SUMMARY.
