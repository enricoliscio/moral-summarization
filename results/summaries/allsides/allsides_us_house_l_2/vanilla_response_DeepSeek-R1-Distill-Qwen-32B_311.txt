Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article says that Trump has blocked Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, from testifying about the Mueller report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department provided a legal opinion stating that McGahn can't be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent. The White House supports this, saying it's to protect future presidents' effectiveness.

McGahn is important because he was involved in Mueller's report, resisting Trump's attempts to obstruct justice. For example, he threatened to resign when Trump wanted Mueller fired. Trump is trying to protect the presidency's office, not himself, according to his statements.

Democrats, like Jerry Nadler, are criticizing this move, calling it an obstruction of justice and a disdain for the law. David Cicilline even suggested impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The Justice Department's opinion doesn't stop McGahn from testifying, but it's risky for his career.

The article also mentions other instances where the Trump administration has blocked testimony, like Carl Kline and William Barr. Trump's relationship with McGahn has soured since the Mueller report's release, and Trump tweeted about not being a fan of McGahn.

Putting this all together, the summary should include the key points: Trump blocking McGahn, the legal reasoning, McGahn's role in Mueller's report, the criticism from Democrats, potential impeachment threats, and other examples of administration obstruction.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to start with Trump's action, explain the legal stance, mention McGahn's role, then the criticism and potential consequences, and end with other instances of obstruction.

Let me draft it step by step to ensure clarity and brevity.
