SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The move has prompted sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment, with the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, condemning the White House's intervention as the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". In a legal opinion, the justice department stated that McGahn cannot be compelled to answer questions under oath, a decision that has been criticized by Democrats as an effort to impede their ability to find the truth and execute their oversight responsibilities. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report and is said to have personally witnessed Trump's most egregious attempts to obstruct justice. Trump has also repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House, including refusing to hand over his tax returns and instructing former officials not to testify. Some Democrats have suggested that impeachment proceedings may be warranted if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The White House, however, maintains that their actions are intended to protect the office of the presidency and set a precedent for future presidents.
