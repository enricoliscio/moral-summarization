Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying, which has led to criticism and potential impeachment threats. The Justice Department's legal opinion is a key point, emphasizing the protection of future presidents. McGahn's role in the Mueller report is important, especially his resistance to Trump's orders.

I should highlight Trump's actions as "blocked," "interference," and "execute." Also, the terms like "obstruction of justice," "impeachment," and "disdain for the law" are crucial. I need to mention the criticism from Nadler and Cicilline, using words like "condemned" and "warranted."

I'll structure the summary to start with Trump's action, then the legal opinion, McGahn's role, the criticism, and the potential for impeachment. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words without making it sound forced. Keeping it concise is important, so I'll focus on the key points and use the required words naturally.

I should also note the consequences of McGahn's potential refusal to testify and the broader implications for oversight and the rule of law. Ending with the tension between the White House and Congress ties it all together.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise summary that hits all the moral points without exceeding 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary terms and flows logically.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and impeachment threats. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify under oath, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. Trump claimed the move was for the "office of the presidency," though critics see it as an effort to obstruct justice and hide misconduct. McGahn, a key figure in Robert Mueller’s report, resisted Trump’s orders to fire Mueller and was tasked with influencing Jeff Sessions to oversee the Russia investigation. Democrats, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, condemned the intervention, calling it a "disdain for the law" and a pattern of obstruction. Rep. David Cicilline warned that failing to compel McGahn’s testimony could warrant impeachment. The move highlights the ongoing tension between the White House and Congress over oversight and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
