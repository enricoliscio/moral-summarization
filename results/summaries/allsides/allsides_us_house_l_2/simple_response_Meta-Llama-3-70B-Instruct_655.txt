SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has sparked outrage by blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department claims lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue this is a blatant attempt to obstruct justice and hide the truth about Trump's alleged misconduct. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to fire Mueller. Democrats have condemned the move as a "disdain for the law" and a "cancer on the presidency." Some have even threatened impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as a brazen attempt to protect Trump from accountability and undermine the rule of law.

END OF SUMMARY.
