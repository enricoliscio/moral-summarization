SUMMARY:
The White House has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The move was condemned by Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, who called it another example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, having stood in the way of Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The justice department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would be risking his career if he chose to do so. This action has been interpreted as the Trump administration blocking oversight attempts by the Democratic-controlled House and has prompted discussions of impeachment. Lawmakers have threatened to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress if he does not meet the deadline for testimony. Trump's ire towards McGahn has increased since the release of the Mueller report, and the former White House counsel now finds himself on the president's "chopping block". Some have criticized William Barr's role in the matter, accusing him of acting as Trump's henchman.
