SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has sparked outrage by blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department's legal opinion claims that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that this move is part of a broader pattern of "disdain for the law" and "obstruction of justice." McGahn's testimony is crucial, as he personally witnessed Trump's alleged misconduct, including attempts to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. Democrats have threatened impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as an attempt to "impede" Congress's ability to uncover the truth and hold the president accountable. As one expert put it, this is a "cancer on the presidency" that must be addressed. END OF SUMMARY.
