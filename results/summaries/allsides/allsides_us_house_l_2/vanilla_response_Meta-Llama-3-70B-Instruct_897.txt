SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent". This move has been met with sharp criticism from Democrats, with some threatening impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, and his testimony could shed light on Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The White House's intervention has been condemned by Democrats, who accuse Trump of trying to protect himself from federal law enforcement. The House Judiciary Committee still expects McGahn to appear on Tuesday, and some members have threatened to open an impeachment inquiry if he does not testify.
