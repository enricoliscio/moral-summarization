SUMMARY:
The White House has blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the Mueller report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and threats of impeachment. The justice department's legal opinion states that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, with the White House citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent". This move has been condemned by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, as an example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". McGahn is a central figure in Mueller's report, having witnessed and impeded some of Trump's most egregious attempts at obstruction of justice. The president has also mused about instructing Republicans to cease dealing with McGahn's law firm. This incident is the latest in a series of blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House, with some Democrats suggesting that impeachment proceedings may be warranted if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The justice department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by doing so.
END OF SUMMARY.
