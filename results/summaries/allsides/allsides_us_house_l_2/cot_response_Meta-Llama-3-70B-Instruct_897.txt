SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, prompting sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law" and "obstruction of justice". McGahn is a central figure in the report, often standing in the way of Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. The White House's intervention was condemned by Jerry Nadler, who said the president acted "perhaps criminally" to protect himself from federal law enforcement. Nadler added that the committee will meet as planned and still expects McGahn to appear, warning that if he doesn't testify, it may be time to open an impeachment inquiry. The justice department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn testifying if he so chooses, although it would be potentially at risk to his own career.
