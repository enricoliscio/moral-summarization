SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, citing executive privilege. The move has prompted criticism and threats of impeachment from Democrats, who argue that McGahn's testimony is crucial to their investigations into obstruction of justice by the President. In response, the House Judiciary Committee is still planning to meet and expects McGahn to appear as scheduled. The Justice Department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by defying the White House. This incident is the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to block oversight attempts by the Democratic-controlled House. Some Democrats have suggested that impeachment proceedings may be necessary if McGahn does not testify.

END OF SUMMARY.
