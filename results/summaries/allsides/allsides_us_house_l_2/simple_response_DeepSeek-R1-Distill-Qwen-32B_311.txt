Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The key points are:

1. Trump is preventing McGahn from testifying, which is causing criticism and even talk of impeachment.
2. The Justice Department's legal opinion says McGahn can't be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedents.
3. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, having resisted Trump's attempts to obstruct justice.
4. Trump claims this action is for the future presidency, not just him.
5. Democrats, like Nadler and Cicilline, are condemning this as obstruction and possibly leading to impeachment.
6. McGahn hasn't testified yet, and there's a deadline approaching.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the conflict between Trump's actions and the Democratic criticism, emphasizing the moral implications like obstruction of justice and potential impeachment.
