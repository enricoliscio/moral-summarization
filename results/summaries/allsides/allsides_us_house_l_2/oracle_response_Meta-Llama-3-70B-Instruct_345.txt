SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The Justice Department's legal opinion claims that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, this move has been condemned as an effort to obstruct justice and protect Trump from accountability. Democratic lawmakers argue that McGahn's testimony is crucial to uncovering the truth about Trump's alleged misconduct, including attempts to interfere with the Russia investigation. The administration's intervention has been characterized as a "disdain for the law" and an attempt to impede Congress's work. If McGahn does not respond to the subpoena, some Democrats are calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. The move is seen as a cancer on the presidency, and McGahn is urged to testify and do his part in uncovering the truth.
