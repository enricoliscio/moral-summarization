SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking outrage and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department claims that McGahn cannot be forced to testify, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that this move is part of a pattern of obstruction of justice and disdain for the law. McGahn's testimony is crucial, as he personally witnessed Trump's alleged misconduct and threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. Democrats are condemning Trump's actions, with some calling for impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as an attempt to protect Trump from accountability and undermine the rule of law. As one Democrat put it, "No one is above the law, including the president of the United States."
