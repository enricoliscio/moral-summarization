SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department argued that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to testify, despite being subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. This decision has been criticized by Democrats, including Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who called the move another example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law". Another Democratic member of the committee suggested that impeachment proceedings could be warranted if McGahn does not testify. The Justice Department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying if he chooses to do so. The White House's intervention comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House.

END OF SUMMARY.
