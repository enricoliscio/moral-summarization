SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, a move that has sparked sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The Justice Department's legal opinion states that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to testify, with the White House citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent". This has been condemned by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, who stated that McGahn personally witnessed the president's most egregious acts of obstruction of justice. He also mentioned that Trump is trying to hide his misconduct from the American people. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings should be initiated if McGahn does not testify. The Trump administration has repeatedly obstructed attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House, including refusing to hand over financial records and tax returns. This latest incident further highlights the administration's disdain for the law and the ongoing efforts to impede the truth-finding process.
END OF SUMMARY.
