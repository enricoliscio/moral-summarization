SUMMARY:
The White House has blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. This decision has prompted sharp criticism and threats of impeachment from Democrats. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, who stood in the way of Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. According to the report, McGahn threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. The move has been condemned by the Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, as an example of the Trump administration's disdain for the law. He described the Mueller report as documenting a "shocking pattern of obstruction of justice" and accused Trump of acting criminally to protect himself. Another Democrat on the committee, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn did not respond to the subpoena, stating that Trump has impeded their ability to find the truth and that no one is above the law. The justice department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by doing so. This incident is the latest example of the Trump administration's ongoing contempt for Congressional oversight and attempts to impede investigations into the president's conduct.
