Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. The user wants a summary that's under 200 words, ending with the specified tokens. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. The Justice Department says McGahn can't be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedents. Trump's press secretary supports this, saying it's for future presidents. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, involved in obstruction of justice. Critics, like Nadler and Cicilline, are condemning this as an abuse of power and even suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The article also mentions other instances where the Trump admin has blocked testimony, showing a pattern.

I need to capture the conflict between Trump's administration and Congress, the legal arguments, and the moral implications like obstruction and potential impeachment. I should keep the summary concise, highlighting the key players and their arguments.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's action, the legal justification, McGahn's role, the criticism, and the broader implications. Make sure to include that McGahn can still testify if he wants but risks his career. Also, mention other examples of the administration blocking oversight.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows well. Let me check the word count as I draft it. I'll make sure to include all the main points without getting too detailed.

Okay, putting it all together now, keeping each sentence focused on the main aspects and the moral framing. I'll end with the implications of the conflict between the branches of government.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has instructed former White House counsel Don McGahn to defy a congressional subpoena, citing legal precedent to protect the office of the presidency. The Justice Department argues that McGahn, a key figure in Robert Mueller's report, cannot be compelled to testify, a move criticized as an attempt to shield Trump from accountability. Democrats, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, condemn the action as obstruction of justice and a disdain for the rule of law. Rep. David Cicilline has threatened impeachment if McGahn does not testify. McGahn, who resisted Trump's efforts to obstruct justice during the Mueller probe, is under pressure to appear before Congress. Trump's administration has repeatedly blocked congressional oversight, including refusing to comply with subpoenas for financial records and other evidence. The standoff highlights a growing conflict between the executive branch and Congress over accountability and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
