SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has sparked outrage by blocking former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department claims that lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." Critics argue that this move is a blatant attempt to obstruct justice and protect Trump from accountability. Democratic leaders have condemned the administration's "disdain for the law" and threatened impeachment if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is seen as a dangerous precedent that undermines the rule of law and the separation of powers. As one expert noted, this is not just a "garden-variety Congressional-executive branch dispute," but a "cancer on the presidency." The administration's repeated attempts to block oversight and stonewall investigations have raised serious concerns about its commitment to transparency and accountability.
