SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, prompting sharp criticism and even threats of impeachment. The justice department's legal opinion claims lawmakers cannot compel McGahn to answer questions under oath, citing "long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent." However, Democrats argue that this move is an effort to obstruct justice and protect Trump from federal law enforcement. The White House's intervention has been condemned as a "shocking pattern of obstruction of justice" and a display of "disdain for the law." If McGahn does not respond to the subpoena, some Democrats are calling for impeachment proceedings to begin. This move is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration's attempts to impede Congressional oversight and block the collection of evidence. As one critic noted, this is a "cancer on the presidency" that must be addressed.
