SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, drawing criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn cannot be compelled to testify, with the White House citing the need to protect the executive branch's authority. McGahn, a central figure in the Mueller report, had previously threatened to resign when Trump ordered Mueller's firing and was dispatched to convince Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. The move was condemned by the House Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Jerry Nadler, who stated that McGahn personally witnessed Trump's alleged obstruction of justice. Another Democrat, David Cicilline, suggested that impeachment proceedings could be warranted if McGahn does not testify. The Justice Department's opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying voluntarily, but he risks his career by doing so. Trump has repeatedly blocked attempts at oversight by the Democratic-controlled House, including refusing to provide tax returns and instructing witnesses not to testify. 

END OF SUMMARY.
