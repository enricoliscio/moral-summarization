Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress regarding the Mueller report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department issued a legal opinion saying that McGahn, as a former White House counsel, can't be compelled to testify. Trump's administration is using this to prevent McGahn from speaking, which is causing criticism and even talk of impeachment.

I should note the key points: Trump's action, the legal opinion, the implications for future presidents, McGahn's role in the Mueller report, the reactions from Democrats like Nadler and Cicilline, and the potential for impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. Also, mention the broader context of the Trump administration resisting congressional oversight.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first state Trump's action, then the legal reasoning, followed by the criticism and potential consequences. Make sure to mention McGahn's importance in the Mueller report and the ongoing conflict between the White House and Congress.

Let me draft a summary that includes all these points succinctly. I'll start with Trump blocking McGahn, mention the Justice Department's stance, the purpose of protecting future presidents, McGahn's role, the criticism from Democrats, the threat of impeachment, and the broader oversight issues. That should cover the essentials without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the Mueller report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and impeachment threats. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent. Trump defended the move, stating it protects future presidential responsibilities. McGahn, a key figure in the Mueller report, reportedly resisted Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, including threatening to resign over Mueller's firing. Democrats, led by Jerry Nadler, condemned the move, calling it an effort to hide Trump's alleged misconduct. David Cicilline warned of impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The Trump administration has repeatedly resisted congressional oversight, including blocking other witnesses and refusing to hand over documents. END OF SUMMARY.
