SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn cannot be forced to testify, citing long-standing precedent. McGahn is a central figure in the Mueller report, having threatened to resign when Trump ordered him to have Mueller fired. Trump claims the move is to protect the office of the presidency for future presidents. Democrats have condemned the move, with Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accusing Trump of trying to block McGahn from speaking about his alleged misconduct. Another Democratic member, David Cicilline, has suggested that impeachment would be warranted if McGahn does not respond to the subpoena. The move is the latest example of the Trump administration's "disdain for the law".

END OF SUMMARY.
