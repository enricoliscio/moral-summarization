Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress regarding the Mueller report. The Justice Department provided a legal opinion saying McGahn can't be compelled to testify because of constitutional precedents. The White House supports this, saying it's to protect future presidents. McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report, having resisted Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, like threatening to resign if Mueller was fired. Trump claims this is for the office's sake, not himself. Critics, like Nadler and Cicilline, are upset, with Cicilline suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify. The Justice Department's opinion doesn't stop McGahn from testifying voluntarily. The article also mentions other instances where the Trump admin has blocked oversight, like Mnuchin refusing to hand over Trump's taxes. 

So, the key points are: Trump blocking McGahn, legal opinion from DOJ, criticism from Democrats, potential impeachment talk, and broader context of Trump resisting oversight. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. Make sure to include Trump's actions, the legal basis, McGahn's role, the criticism, and the implications. Also, mention the ongoing tensions between the White House and Congress. Keep it clear and to the point.
