Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by saying Trump has blocked McGahn, the former White House counsel, from testifying about the Mueller report on Russian election interference. This has caused a lot of criticism and even talk of impeachment. The Justice Department released a legal opinion stating that McGahn can't be compelled to testify because of constitutional precedents. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, supports this, saying it's to protect future presidents.

McGahn is a key figure in the Mueller report because he tried to stop Trump from obstructing justice. He even threatened to resign when Trump wanted Mueller fired. Trump, when asked about it, said it's for the office of the presidency, not just him. He thinks it's an important precedent.

The Democratic chairman of the judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, is upset. He says the Mueller report shows Trump obstructing justice and that McGahn witnessed some of the worst acts. Nadler thinks Trump doesn't want the public to hear about his alleged misconduct. Another Democrat, David Cicilline, went further, suggesting impeachment if McGahn doesn't testify.

The Justice Department's opinion doesn't stop McGahn from testifying, but it might risk his career. Trump has also been blocking other attempts by Congress to get information, like refusing to hand over tax returns. The article mentions other instances where the administration has defied subpoenas.

So, putting this together, the summary should cover Trump blocking McGahn, the legal reasoning, McGahn's role in the Mueller report, the criticism from Democrats, possible impeachment, and the broader context of Trump's administration defying Congress.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's action, then the reasons, McGahn's significance, the criticism, and the implications.
