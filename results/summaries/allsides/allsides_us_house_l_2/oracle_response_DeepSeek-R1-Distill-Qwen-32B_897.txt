Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants a summary that includes as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, up to 200 words, and placed between "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to grasp the main points. It's about Donald Trump blocking Don McGahn from testifying before Congress regarding the Mueller report on Russian interference. The Justice Department's legal opinion is a key point, stating that McGahn can't be compelled to testify. This is framed as protecting future presidents but is criticized as obstructing justice and undermining Congress.

Next, I'll identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "blocked," "interference," "compel," "obstruct," "justice," "investigation," "move," "disdain," "impeachment," "evidence," "truth," "above," "inquiry," "instruction," "refused," "refusing" are central to the narrative.

I need to structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Trump blocking McGahn, mention the Justice Department's stance, the criticism from Democrats, the potential impeachment, and the broader context of Trump's administration's resistance to oversight.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the conflict between executive privilege and congressional oversight. Emphasize the moral implications, such as obstruction of justice and the potential for impeachment, to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft a concise version, making sure each sentence includes relevant moral terms without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words. Finally, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, sparking criticism and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department argued that McGahn, subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee, cannot be compelled to testify, citing constitutional precedent to protect future presidents. Trump claimed the move was for the "office of the presidency," not himself. Critics, including Democratic Chairman Jerry Nadler, accused Trump of obstructing justice and attempting to hide misconduct. Nadler condemned the intervention as part of Trump's "disdain for the law," while Democratic member David Cicilline suggested impeachment if McGahn did not testify. The move follows a pattern of Trump administration efforts to impede congressional oversight, including refusal to comply with subpoenas for financial records and Mueller report evidence. McGahn, a key figure in Mueller's report, has faced Trump's ire since its release. The conflict highlights tensions between executive privilege and congressional accountability, with some warning of broader implications for the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
