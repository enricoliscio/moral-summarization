SUMMARY: Donald Trump has blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress about the special counsel report on Russian election interference, citing executive privilege. The move has sparked criticism and threats of impeachment from Democrats, who argue that McGahn's testimony is crucial to their investigations into obstruction of justice by the President. In response, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to meet as planned and still expects McGahn to appear. The Justice Department's legal opinion does not prevent McGahn from testifying, but he would risk his career by doing so. This incident is the latest example of the Trump administration's resistance to Congressional oversight, with the President citing the need to protect the office of the presidency. Democrats have condemned the move, with some suggesting that impeachment may be necessary if McGahn does not testify. The White House's intervention has been criticized as a disregard for the law, and it remains to be seen whether McGahn will comply with the subpoena.

END OF SUMMARY.
