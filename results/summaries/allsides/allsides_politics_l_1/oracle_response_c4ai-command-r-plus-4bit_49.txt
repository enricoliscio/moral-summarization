SUMMARY: Mattis, a former general and Cabinet official, has broken his silence and publicly criticized President Trump for his response to the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests. Mattis writes that Trump tries to divide Americans and that his actions directly threaten the American experiment. He contrasts the American ethos of unity with Nazi ideology and emphasizes the importance of civilian leadership in keeping public order. Mattis also implicitly criticizes the current secretary of defense, Mark Esper, and other senior officials for their role in the militarized response to the protests. He argues that the military should only be used on rare occasions when requested by state governors and that militarizing the response to civilian protests erodes the bond between the military and society. Mattis believes that civilian leaders are better equipped to understand and address the needs of their communities. His statement is a strong condemnation of Trump's leadership and a defense of the Constitutional rights of all Americans.
