Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis criticizing Trump. Let me read through the article first to get the main points. Mattis says Trump is the first president he's seen who doesn't try to unite the country and instead divides people. He mentions the consequences of three years of this division and the lack of mature leadership. Mattis believes the country can unite without Trump, but it won't be easy. He draws a contrast between American unity and Nazi ideology, referencing the Normandy invasion slogan. 

He also talks about his past stance on not criticizing a sitting president to maintain the military's apolitical nature, but now he feels it's time to speak out because Trump's actions are threatening the American experiment. The trigger for his public condemnation was Trump's response to George Floyd's death and the protests, including the use of troops for photo ops. Mattis criticizes the idea of using the military as a battlespace and the militarization of responses, which he believes erodes trust between the military and civilians. He emphasizes that maintaining public order is the responsibility of state and local leaders, not the military.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Mattis's main criticisms of Trump, his change in stance from not criticizing to speaking out, the specific issues like the military's role in protests, and the implications for unity and trust. I'll structure it to first mention Mattis's criticism, then his reasons, the trigger event, and the broader implications. I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
