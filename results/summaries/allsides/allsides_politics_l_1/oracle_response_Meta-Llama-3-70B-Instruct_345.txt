SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive leadership, which he believes is threatening the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's actions, particularly his response to the George Floyd protests, are a deliberate effort to divide the American people, contrary to the nation's ethos of unity. He criticizes Trump for trying to dominate the situation with military force, rather than supporting and defending the Constitution. Mattis emphasizes that the military's role is to protect civilian society, not to violate their constitutional rights. He urges Americans to unite without Trump's leadership, drawing on the strengths of civil society to surmount the current crisis. Mattis's statement is a call to action, warning that the country's moral ground is being eroded by Trump's actions and that it's time to take a stand against divisive leadership.
