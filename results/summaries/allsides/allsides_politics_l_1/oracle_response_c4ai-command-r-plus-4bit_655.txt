SUMMARY: Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis released a statement condemning President Donald Trump's response to the protests following the killing of George Floyd. Mattis, who resigned from his post in 2018, had previously refrained from publicly criticizing the president, but now believes the American experiment is directly threatened by Trump's actions. He writes that Trump tries to divide Americans rather than unite them and contrasts this with the American ethos of unity. Mattis finds it unacceptable that troops would be ordered to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens and criticizes the militarization of the response to the protests, arguing that it erodes the bond between the military and civilian society. He emphasizes the importance of civilian leaders in keeping public order and the need to reject thinking that treats our cities as a 'battlespace'. Mattis' statement reflects his dissatisfaction with Trump's lack of mature leadership and his commitment to defending the Constitution and protecting the country.
