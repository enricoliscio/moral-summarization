SUMMARY:

Former US Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly criticized President Donald Trump, accusing him of deliberately trying to divide the American people instead of uniting them. Mattis wrote that Trump's actions have led to a crisis, but he believes that the country can unite without him, drawing on the strengths of its civil society. Mattis specifically condemned Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, saying that it was wrong to use the military to violate the constitutional rights of citizens. He also criticized the idea of militarizing the response to protests, saying it erodes the trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis had previously kept silent about his disagreements with Trump, but felt compelled to speak out now because he believes the American experiment is directly threatened by the president's actions.
