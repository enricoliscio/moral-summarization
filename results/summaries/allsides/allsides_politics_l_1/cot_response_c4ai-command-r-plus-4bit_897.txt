SUMMARY:
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has released a statement condemning President Donald Trump's response to the recent protests and the police killing of George Floyd. Mattis, who resigned from his position in 2018, highlights Trump's divisive nature and his failure to *unite* the American people. He contrasts this with the American ethos of *unity*, drawing a parallel with Nazi ideology, which sought to *divide* and *conquer*. Mattis emphasizes the *threat* posed by Trump's actions to the American experiment and the *responsibility* of the military to *defend* the Constitution. He criticizes the militarization of the response to the protests, stating that it erodes the *trusted* bond between the military and civilian society and sets up a *conflict*. Mattis concludes that *order* must be maintained by civilian leaders who understand their communities and are answerable to them. His statement reflects a shift in his previous stance of refraining from criticizing a sitting president, indicating that he believes the situation demands a moral stance.
