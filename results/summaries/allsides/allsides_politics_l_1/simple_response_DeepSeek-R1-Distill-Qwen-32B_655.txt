Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Mattis's public statement where he criticizes Trump for not uniting the country and instead dividing it. Mattis contrasts this with the American ethos of unity, even referencing the Normandy invasion and the Nazi "divide and conquer" strategy. He mentions his oath to the Constitution and condemns the use of military in domestic situations, especially in Washington, D.C. He also implicitly criticizes the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper.

I should make sure the summary includes Mattis's main points: Trump's divisive leadership, the reference to unity vs. Nazi tactics, his oath to the Constitution, the military's role, and the criticism of Esper. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and in the specified format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Mattis's criticism of Trump, mention the contrast with American unity, then his oath and the military's inappropriate use, and end with his criticism of Esper. Keep it concise but cover all key points.

I need to ensure the moral framing is clear, so phrases like "erodes the moral ground" and "trusted bond" should be included. Also, mention that Mattis's silence period is over, leading to this public statement.

Putting it all together, making sure each sentence flows logically and stays within the word limit.

Mattis contrasts Trump's leadership with the American ethos of unity, referencing the Normandy invasion slogan "In Union there is Strength" against the Nazi "Divide and Conquer" strategy. He condemns Trump's response to the George Floyd protests, stating that using troops for a "photo op" violates constitutional rights and militarizes domestic affairs. Mattis criticizes the idea of treating cities as a "battlespace" and warns that such actions erode the moral bond between the military and society. He also implicitly criticizes current Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and other officials. Mattis, who previously refrained from criticizing a sitting president, has now broken his silence, asserting that Trump's actions threaten the American experiment. END OF SUMMARY.
