SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive leadership, which he believes threatens the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's actions, particularly in response to the George Floyd protests, have deliberately divided the nation and violated the Constitutional rights of citizens. He rejects the militarization of the response, which erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. Instead, Mattis calls for unity and strength, drawing on the inherent strengths of American civil society. He urges the nation to summon its unity to surmount the current crisis, confident that Americans are better than their politics. END OF SUMMARY.
