SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive actions, which he believes threaten the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's deliberate effort to divide the American people is a stark contrast to the nation's ethos of unity and strength. He criticizes the president's response to the George Floyd protests, including the use of military force, which Mattis sees as a violation of Constitutional rights and a threat to the moral ground between the military and civilian society. Mattis urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society to overcome the current crisis. He emphasizes the importance of mature leadership, responsibility, and protecting the nation's promise. END OF SUMMARY.
