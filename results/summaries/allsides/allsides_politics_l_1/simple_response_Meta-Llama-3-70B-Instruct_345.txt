SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary General James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive leadership, citing the president's response to the George Floyd protests as the catalyst. Mattis argues that Trump's actions have deliberately divided the American people, contrary to the nation's ethos of unity. He draws a stark contrast between the American ideal of "In Union there is Strength" and the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer." Mattis criticizes Trump's militarized response to the protests, which he believes erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. He urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, and to reject the notion of cities as a "battlespace" to be dominated by the military. Mattis's statement is a call to action, emphasizing the need to summon unity to surmount the current crisis and protect the American experiment.
