SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive leadership, citing the president's response to the George Floyd protests as the catalyst. Mattis argues that Trump's actions have deliberately divided the American people, contrary to the nation's ethos of unity. He draws a stark contrast between the American ideal of "In Union there is Strength" and the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer." Mattis warns that the militarization of domestic responses, as seen in Washington D.C., erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society, setting up a false conflict. He emphasizes that keeping public order is the responsibility of civilian leaders, not the military. Mattis's statement is a call to action, urging Americans to unite without Trump's leadership and to defend the nation's promise.
