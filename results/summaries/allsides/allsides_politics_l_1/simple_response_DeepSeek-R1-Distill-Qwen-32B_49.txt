Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

Mattis is a former Defense Secretary who didn't speak out against Trump while he was in office, but now he's criticizing him. He says Trump is dividing the country instead of uniting it, which is a big deal because Mattis is a respected military leader. He contrasts Trump's approach with the American values of unity, even referencing the Normandy invasion where the US motto was "In Union there is Strength" against Nazi "Divide and Conquer."

He specifically mentions Trump's response to George Floyd's death and the protests, saying that using the military for such situations is wrong and undermines the trust between the military and civilians. He criticizes the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, and others for this approach. Mattis feels that the military should only be used in rare cases, as decided by state governors, not for political photo ops or to militarize domestic issues.

Also, Mattis had previously kept silent after leaving the Pentagon, believing that former officials shouldn't criticize the current president, but he's now speaking out because he believes the American experiment is threatened by Trump's actions.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points: Mattis's shift from silence to speaking out, the moral argument about unity vs division, the criticism of Trump's handling of protests, the concern over military use, and the reference to historical unity.

I should structure it to first mention Mattis's criticism, then his reasons, the historical contrast, the specific issues with Trump's actions, and his previous stance on not criticizing the president. Keeping it under 200 words and in clear, concise English without markdown.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included and the moral framing is preserved. I'll start with Mattis's criticism, then his reasons, the historical reference, the specific incidents, and his previous stance before ending with the current situation.
