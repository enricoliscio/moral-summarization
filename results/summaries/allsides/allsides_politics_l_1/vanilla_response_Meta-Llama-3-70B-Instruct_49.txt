SUMMARY:

Former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has broken his silence to criticize President Donald Trump, accusing him of trying to divide the American people instead of uniting them. Mattis writes that the president's response to the George Floyd protests, including the use of military troops, has triggered his public condemnation. He argues that the militarization of the response has set up a false conflict between the military and civilian society, eroding the trust between the two. Mattis contrasts Trump's approach with the American ethos of unity, citing the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer" and the American answer "In Union there is Strength." He urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, to surmount the current crisis. Mattis's statement marks a significant departure from his previous silence, which he had maintained out of respect for the apolitical nature of the military.
