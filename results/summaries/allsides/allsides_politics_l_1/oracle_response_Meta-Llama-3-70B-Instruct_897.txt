SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis publicly condemned President Trump's actions, breaking his silence after three years. Mattis accused Trump of deliberately trying to divide the American people, rather than unite them. He contrasted this with the American ethos of unity, citing the Nazi ideology of "Divide and Conquer" and the American response of "In Union there is Strength." Mattis was triggered by Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, which he saw as a threat to the American experiment. He criticized Trump's actions as a violation of the Constitutional rights of citizens and a militarization of the response, which erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. Mattis emphasized the importance of civilian leadership in keeping public order and urged Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society.
