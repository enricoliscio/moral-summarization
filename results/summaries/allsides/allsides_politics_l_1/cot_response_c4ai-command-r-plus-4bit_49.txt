SUMMARY:
Mattis, a former US Secretary of Defense, has broken his silence on Trump's presidency, accusing him of deliberately trying to divide the American people and threatening the American experiment. Mattis emphasizes the importance of *unity*, contrasting it with Nazi ideology, and highlights the *consequences* of Trump's divisive actions. He condemns the militarization of the response to protests, stating that it sets up a *conflict* between the *military* and *civilian society* and erodes the *trusted bond* between them. Mattis also criticizes the current administration for violating the Constitutional rights of citizens and underscores the *responsibility* of civilian leaders in maintaining *order* while being *answerable* to their communities. He believes that the use of the *military* should be rare and only at the request of state governors. Mattis concludes that the country must unite without Trump, drawing on its strengths to overcome the current crisis.
