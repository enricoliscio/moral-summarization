Alright, I need to summarize the given article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with Mattis stating that Trump is the first president he's seen who doesn't try to unite the country. Instead, Trump divides people, and the consequences are evident after three years. Mattis believes the country can unite without Trump, drawing on civil society's strengths, though it won't be easy. He contrasts American unity with Nazi ideology, referencing the Normandy invasion.

Then, it mentions Mattis's history. He didn't criticize Trump while in the Pentagon but later felt it was inappropriate for a former general to criticize a sitting president. However, he changed his stance, feeling the period of silence was over. The trigger was Trump's response to George Floyd's death and the protests. Mattis criticizes the use of military troops for a photo op and the militarization of domestic responses, which he sees as eroding trust between the military and civilians.

So, the key points are:
1. Mattis criticizes Trump for dividing the country instead of uniting.
2. Mattis believes the country can unite without Trump.
3. He contrasts American unity with Nazi "divide and conquer."
4. Mattis broke his silence due to Trump's handling of Floyd protests.
5. He criticizes using military for domestic issues, undermining trust.

I need to condense these points into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include Mattis's main criticisms, the trigger for his statement, and his concerns about military involvement.

Let me structure it: Start with Mattis's criticism of Trump, mention the consequences, his belief in unity without Trump, the historical reference, his change in stance, the trigger event, and his concerns about military use.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown. The summary should flow logically, connecting each point smoothly.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary, making sure each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

Mattis warns that Trump's actions over three years have weakened national unity and leadership, urging the country to come together without him. He draws a contrast between American unity and Nazi Germany's "divide and conquer" strategy, emphasizing the need for solidarity. Mattis, who previously refrained from criticizing Trump publicly, has now broken his silence due to Trump's handling of the George Floyd protests, which he condemns as unconstitutional. He criticizes the use of military troops for domestic responses, arguing it undermines trust between the military and civilians. Mattis believes the military should only be used in rare cases, as determined by state governors, to maintain the trusted bond with society. END OF SUMMARY.
