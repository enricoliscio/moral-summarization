Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article's content. It's about Mattis criticizing Trump's leadership, particularly regarding division and the use of military in domestic affairs.

First, I should identify the key points. Mattis says Trump doesn't try to unite and instead divides the country, which has led to negative consequences. He contrasts this with the American ethos of unity, referencing historical events like the Normandy invasion. Mattis also criticizes the military's involvement in domestic protests, arguing it undermines trust and constitutional rights.

Next, I need to make sure I include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "unite," "divide," "leadership," "protect," "violate," "conflict," "erodes," etc., are crucial. I should structure the summary to highlight Mattis's main criticisms and the moral implications he's emphasizing.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mattis's main criticism, then move on to the historical reference, followed by his concerns about military use and the erosion of trust. I'll conclude with the impact on the American experiment.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
General Mattis criticizes Donald Trump for failing to unite the American people and instead dividing the nation, leading to three years of consequences from this deliberate effort. He contrasts Trump's leadership with the American ethos of unity, referencing the Normandy invasion, where the U.S. answered the Nazi "divide and conquer" slogan with "In Union there is Strength." Mattis condemns the use of military forces in domestic protests, arguing it violates constitutional rights and militarizes public order, eroding trust between the military and society. He criticizes the current administration's actions, including the police killing of George Floyd and the military's role in protests, which he sees as a bizarre photo op for the president. Mattis warns that such actions threaten the American experiment and the moral bond between the military and civilians. He emphasizes that maintaining public order is the responsibility of state and local leaders, not the military. END OF SUMMARY.
