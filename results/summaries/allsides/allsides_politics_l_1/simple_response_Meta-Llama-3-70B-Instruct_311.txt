SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary General James Mattis publicly condemns President Donald Trump's divisive leadership, citing the president's response to the George Floyd protests as the catalyst for his criticism. Mattis argues that Trump's actions are a threat to the American experiment and that the president's deliberate effort to divide the country is a stark contrast to the nation's ethos of unity. Mattis draws a moral distinction between the American values of unity and the Nazi ideology of "Divide and Conquer." He emphasizes the importance of rejecting the militarization of domestic responses, which erodes the trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, and to reject the false conflict between the military and civilians. He calls for a return to the nation's founding principles, where public order is maintained by civilian leaders who are accountable to their communities.
