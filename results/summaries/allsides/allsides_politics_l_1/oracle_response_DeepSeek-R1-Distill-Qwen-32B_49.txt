Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. Mattis criticizes Trump for not uniting the country and instead dividing it, which has led to negative consequences. He references historical unity, like the Normandy invasion, to highlight the importance of unity now. Mattis also mentions his past stance on not criticizing a sitting president but feels compelled to speak out now because he believes Trump's actions are threatening the American experiment. Specifically, he's upset about the military's role in handling protests, which he sees as undermining the Constitution and the bond between the military and civilians.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words like "unite," "divide," "protect," "violate," etc. I should structure the summary to first state Mattis's criticism of Trump, then his historical reference, followed by his change in stance and the specific issues with military involvement. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive. Also, I should ensure that the moral framing is clear and that the summary flows logically from Mattis's criticism to his reasons for speaking out now. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language natural, as per the user's request.

Mattis warns of the consequences of three years of such leadership, emphasizing the need for unity to overcome the current crisis. He contrasts the American ethos of "In Union there is Strength" with Nazi ideology, urging the country to reject division. Mattis, who previously refrained from criticizing a sitting president, now condemns Trump's response to the George Floyd protests, stating it violates constitutional rights and militarizes domestic affairs. He criticizes the use of the military in domestic "battlespaces," arguing it erodes trust between the military and civilians. Mattis emphasizes that maintaining public order is the responsibility of state and local leaders, not the federal military. His statement reflects a moral duty to protect the American experiment, which he believes is threatened by Trump's actions.
