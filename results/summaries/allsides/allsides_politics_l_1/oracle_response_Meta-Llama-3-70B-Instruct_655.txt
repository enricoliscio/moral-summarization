SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary General James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Donald Trump's divisive actions, which he believes threaten the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's efforts to divide the nation are a deliberate attempt to destroy unity, contrasting with the American ethos of "In Union there is Strength." He criticizes Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd, which led to militarizing the response and violating citizens' Constitutional rights. Mattis emphasizes that the military should only be used in rare occasions, as requested by state governors, and that keeping public order rests with civilian leaders. He urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, to surmount the current crisis. Mattis's statement is a call to action, emphasizing the need to protect the country and defend its promise, which past generations have bled to defend.
