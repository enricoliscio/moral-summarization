SUMMARY:
Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis has broken his silence on President Donald Trump's leadership, arguing that the president deliberately tries to *divide* the American people and that his actions pose a *threat* to the American experiment. Mattis emphasizes the importance of *unity* and *strength* through *union*, contrasting it with Nazi ideology. He criticizes Trump's response to the George Floyd protests, including the use of the military to *dominate* American cities, which he believes erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. Mattis highlights the *responsibility* of civilian leaders in *protecting* public order and the need to reject the militarization of our response to civil unrest. He believes that the current approach sets up an unnecessary *conflict* and undermines the *trust* between the military and the society they are sworn to *protect*. Mattis concludes that we must summon *unity* and *confidence* to overcome this crisis and preserve our democracy.
