SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary General James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive actions, which he believes threaten the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's deliberate effort to divide the country is a stark contrast to the American ethos of unity and strength. He criticizes the president's response to the George Floyd protests, particularly the militarization of the response, which erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. Mattis urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, and to reject any thinking that views cities as a "battlespace" to be dominated. He emphasizes the importance of protecting the Constitutional rights of citizens and maintaining a trusted bond between the military and society. END OF SUMMARY.
