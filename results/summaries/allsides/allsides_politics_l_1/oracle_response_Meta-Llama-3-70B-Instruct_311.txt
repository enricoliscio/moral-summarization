SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis publicly condemned President Donald Trump's actions, stating that Trump "tries to divide us" and has failed to provide "mature leadership" to the American people. Mattis argues that Trump's deliberate effort to divide the nation has led to the current crisis, and that it's time to "unite without him" by drawing on the strengths of American civil society. He contrasts the American ethos of unity with Nazi ideology, citing the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer" and the American answer "In Union there is Strength." Mattis criticizes Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd, stating that it's unacceptable for troops to be ordered to "violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens" and for the military to be used to "dominate" civilian society. He emphasizes the importance of protecting the Constitution and keeping public order through civilian leaders who understand their communities.
