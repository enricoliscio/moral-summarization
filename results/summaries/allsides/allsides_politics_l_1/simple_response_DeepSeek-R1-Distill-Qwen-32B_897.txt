Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump, making sure to keep the moral framing the author used. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Mattis is criticizing Trump for dividing the country instead of uniting it. He compares this to the Nazi "divide and conquer" strategy, emphasizing American unity. Mattis also talks about his past stance against criticizing a sitting president but now feels it's necessary because Trump's actions threaten the American experiment, especially regarding the George Floyd protests. He criticizes the use of military in domestic affairs, saying it undermines trust and the constitutional rights.

I need to capture Mattis's shift from silence to speaking out, his moral stance on unity, and his concerns about military involvement. I should keep the language clear and concise, making sure to include the key moral points without getting bogged down in details. I'll structure the summary to highlight Mattis's main arguments and the underlying moral framework he uses.

Now, I'll start drafting the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll make sure to mention Trump's division, Mattis's comparison to Nazi tactics, the George Floyd protests as the trigger, and the criticism of military use. I'll also include Mattis's previous stance on not criticizing the president and his change of heart.

Let me check the word count as I go. I think I have all the key points covered. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary details. Once done, I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the moral framing and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Retired General James Mattis has publicly criticized former President Donald Trump for failing to unite the American people, instead fostering division and weakening national unity. Mattis contrasts Trump's approach with the American ethos of unity, drawing a moral distinction between the Nazi "divide and conquer" strategy and the American principle of "In Union there is Strength." He argues that Trump's response to the George Floyd protests, including the use of military troops for political photo ops, violates constitutional rights and undermines the trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis, who previously refrained from criticizing a sitting president to maintain the military's apolitical nature, now believes the American experiment is threatened by Trump's actions. He condemns the militarization of domestic responses, asserting that military involvement in such contexts erodes the moral bond between service members and the communities they protect. Mattis emphasizes the importance of civilian leadership in maintaining public order and upholding constitutional values. END OF SUMMARY.
