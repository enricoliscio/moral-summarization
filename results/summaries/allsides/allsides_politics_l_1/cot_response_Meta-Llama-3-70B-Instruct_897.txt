SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive leadership, which he believes is threatening the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's actions, particularly in response to the police killing of George Floyd, have deliberately divided the American people and eroded the moral ground between the military and civilian society. He urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, and to reject the militarization of public order. Mattis believes that keeping public order rests with civilian leaders who are answerable to their communities. He emphasizes the importance of upholding the Constitution and protecting the rights of fellow citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
