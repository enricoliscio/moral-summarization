SUMMARY:

Former US Defense Secretary General James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Donald Trump's divisive leadership, which he believes is threatening the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's efforts to divide the nation are a deliberate attempt to undermine unity, contrasting with the American ethos of "In Union there is Strength." He criticizes Trump's response to the George Floyd killing and subsequent protests, which he sees as a violation of Constitutional rights and a militarization of the response. Mattis urges Americans to unite without Trump, drawing on the strengths of civil society, and to reject the notion of cities as a "battlespace" to be dominated by the military. He emphasizes the importance of protecting the country and defending its promise, while also keeping public order through civilian leadership. Mattis's statement is a call to action, urging Americans to surmount the current crisis and defend their values. END OF SUMMARY.
