SUMMARY:

Former US Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly criticized President Donald Trump, accusing him of deliberately dividing the American people instead of uniting them. Mattis wrote that Trump's actions have led to a crisis and that it's time for Americans to unite without him. He contrasted the American ethos of unity with Nazi ideology, citing the US military's motto "In Union there is Strength" against the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer." Mattis broke his silence after Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, which he saw as a threat to the American experiment. He also criticized the militarization of the response to the protests, saying it erodes the trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis urged Americans to reject the idea of using the military to dominate cities and instead rely on civilian leaders to maintain public order.
