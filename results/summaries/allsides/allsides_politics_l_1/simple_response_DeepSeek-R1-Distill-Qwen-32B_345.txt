Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis criticizing Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article is pretty detailed, so I should focus on the key points Mattis made.

First, Mattis is a former Secretary of Defense who's now criticizing Trump for not uniting the country. He contrasts Trump's divisiveness with the American ideal of unity, even referencing the Normandy invasion and the Nazi "divide and conquer" strategy. That's a strong moral statement about the importance of unity.

Then, Mattis mentions his past stance on not criticizing a sitting president, but now he feels compelled to speak out because he sees the country's experiment in democracy being threatened. The trigger was Trump's response to George Floyd's death and the protests, where Mattis criticizes the use of military troops for photo ops and militarizing domestic responses. He argues this erodes trust between the military and civilians.

I should make sure to include these elements: Mattis's criticism of Trump's divisiveness, the moral contrast with unity, his shift from silence to speaking out, the specific issue with George Floyd and military use, and the erosion of trust. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral framing. Let me structure it to highlight Mattis's concerns about the country's unity and the potential threat to democracy.
