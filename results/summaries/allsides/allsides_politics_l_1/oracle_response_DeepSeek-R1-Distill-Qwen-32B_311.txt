Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about General Mattis criticizing Donald Trump for not trying to unite the country and instead dividing it. Mattis mentions the consequences of Trump's leadership over the past three years, emphasizing the importance of unity, especially referencing historical examples like the Normandy invasion. He contrasts this with Trump's actions, particularly regarding the response to George Floyd's death and the protests. Mattis also talks about his past stance on not criticizing a sitting president but now feels compelled to speak out because he believes Trump's actions are threatening the American experiment.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided that are used in the article. Words like "unite," "divide," "leadership," "bled," "defend," "surmount," "crisis," "protecting," "threatened," "actions," "response," "killing," "support," "ordered," "violate," "provide," "called," "dominate," "militarizing," "conflict," "erodes," "keeping," "understand." 

I should make sure the summary includes these words where appropriate. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of Mattis's criticism, the moral implications, and the contrast he draws between unity and division. I'll structure it by highlighting Mattis's main points: Trump's divisive actions, the historical contrast, the specific criticisms of the military's role, and Mattis's shift from silence to speaking out.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with Mattis's criticism, moving to the historical reference, then to the specific incidents, and ending with the consequences of militarization and Mattis's decision to speak out. I need to keep it tight and within the word limit, making sure each sentence adds value and incorporates the moral framing words.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check each sentence to see if it conveys the moral stance and uses the right terminology. Once done, I'll count the words to make sure it's under 200 and adjust if necessary.
