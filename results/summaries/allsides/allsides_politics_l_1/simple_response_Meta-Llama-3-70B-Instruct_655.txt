SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Donald Trump's divisive leadership, which he believes is threatening the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's actions, particularly his response to the George Floyd protests, have deliberately divided the nation and undermined the Constitution. He criticizes the president's decision to use the military to dominate American cities, which erodes the trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis emphasizes that the military's role is to support and defend the Constitution, not to violate citizens' rights or provide a photo op for the president. He calls for unity and rejects the notion of militarizing responses to domestic crises, instead advocating for civilian leaders to maintain public order. Mattis's statement marks a significant departure from his previous reluctance to criticize the president, and his words carry weight as a former general and Cabinet official.
