SUMMARY: In a powerful statement, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis condemns President Donald Trump's leadership, accusing him of deliberately trying to divide the American people instead of uniting them. Mattis emphasizes the importance of unity, contrasting it with Nazi ideology, and argues that Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the protests threatens the American experiment. He criticizes the use of the military to dominate civilian society, eroding the moral bond between the military and the people they are sworn to protect. Mattis also implicitly criticizes the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, and other senior officials for their role in the militarized response to the protests. He asserts that keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who understand their communities. Mattis' statement highlights his belief in the strength of unity and the importance of defending the Constitution and protecting the rights of citizens.
