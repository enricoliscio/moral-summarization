SUMMARY: Former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has released a statement strongly criticizing President Donald Trump's response to the recent protests and riots across the country following the death of George Floyd. Mattis, who served as Trump's defense secretary from 2017 to 2018, writes that Trump is deliberately trying to divide the American people and that his actions threaten the American experiment. He condemns the use of the military to suppress protests and criticizes the current administration's leadership, including the current Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, for their handling of the situation. Mattis emphasizes the importance of unity and contrasts it with Nazi ideology, stating that the military should only be used on rare occasions and at the request of state governors. He concludes that the American people must unite without Trump to overcome the current crisis and protect the country's values and democracy.
