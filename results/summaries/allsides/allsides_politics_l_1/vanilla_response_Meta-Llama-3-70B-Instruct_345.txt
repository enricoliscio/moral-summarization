SUMMARY:

Former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has publicly condemned President Donald Trump's leadership, stating that Trump is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Mattis argues that Trump's actions have deliberately divided the country, and that the president's response to the George Floyd protests has threatened the American experiment. Mattis criticizes Trump's decision to use military troops to dominate cities, violating citizens' constitutional rights, and calls for unity and mature leadership. He also implicitly criticizes current Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other senior officials for their role in militarizing the response to protests. Mattis emphasizes the importance of keeping public order with civilian leaders and maintaining a trusted bond between the military and civilian society.
