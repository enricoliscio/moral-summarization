SUMMARY: In a powerful statement, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis condemns President Donald Trump's leadership, accusing him of deliberately dividing the American people and threatening the American experiment. Mattis highlights the contrast between American values of unity and Nazi ideology, emphasizing the importance of unity in overcoming the current crisis. He argues that the military should not be used to violate the Constitutional rights of citizens or for political photo ops, and criticizes the militarization of the response to protests. Mattis also emphasizes the responsibility of civilian leaders in maintaining public order, respecting the bond between the military and society. His statement reflects a deep dissatisfaction with Trump's actions and a belief that they pose a direct threat to the nation. It marks a turning point, as Mattis has previously refrained from publicly criticizing the president out of respect for the office and the military's apolitical nature. Mattis' words carry significant weight as a former general and Cabinet official, and his condemnation of Trump's actions and leadership is a stark warning to the American people. END OF SUMMARY.
