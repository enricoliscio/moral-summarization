Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Mattis is a former Pentagon chief who's criticizing Trump for dividing the country instead of uniting. He mentions the consequences of three years of this division and compares it to Nazi ideology, emphasizing American unity. He's breaking his silence, which he previously maintained to protect the military's neutrality. The trigger was Trump's handling of the George Floyd protests, where Mattis criticizes the use of military troops for a photo op and the militarization of domestic responses. He also criticizes Esper and other officials, stressing the importance of civilian leadership in maintaining public order.

I need to make sure the summary includes Mattis's main points: Trump's divisiveness, the comparison to Nazi Germany, breaking silence due to the protests, criticism of military use, and the moral implications. Also, it's important to note that Mattis's previous stance was to avoid criticizing the president, but he's now speaking out because he sees the American experiment as threatened.

I should structure the summary to highlight Mattis's shift from silence to speaking out, his moral stance against division, and the specific issues with Trump's actions. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll start by introducing Mattis and his criticism, then move on to the reasons for his change in stance, the comparison to Nazi ideology, the specifics about the protests, and the broader implications for military and civilian roles. Finally, I'll conclude with the moral ground and unity he emphasizes.

SUMMARY: James Mattis, a former Pentagon chief, has publicly criticized Donald Trump for failing to unite the American people, instead dividing the nation. Mattis contrasts Trump's leadership with the American ethos of unity, citing the Nazi "Divide and Conquer" strategy and the American response of "In Union there is Strength." He argues that Trump's actions, particularly in response to the George Floyd protests, threaten the American experiment and the Constitution. Mattis, who previously refrained from criticizing a sitting president to maintain military neutrality, now condemns the use of troops for political photo ops and the militarization of domestic responses. He criticizes the idea of treating cities as "battlespaces" and warns that such actions erode the moral bond between the military and civilian society. Mattis emphasizes the importance of civilian leadership in maintaining public order and protecting constitutional rights. His statement reflects a shift from silence to public condemnation, driven by the belief that Trump's actions directly threaten American unity and democratic values. END OF SUMMARY.
