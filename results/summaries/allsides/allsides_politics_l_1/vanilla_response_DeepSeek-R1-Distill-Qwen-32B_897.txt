Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. Mattis is a retired general and former Secretary of Defense under Trump. He's criticizing Trump for not uniting the country and instead dividing it. He mentions the consequences of three years of this division and the lack of mature leadership. Mattis also contrasts American unity with Nazi ideology, using the Normandy invasion example. He's now publicly speaking out against Trump, which he didn't do before because he thought it wasn't appropriate for a former general to criticize a sitting president. But now he feels the need to speak up because he believes Trump's actions are threatening the American experiment, specifically mentioning the response to George Floyd's death and the protests. He criticizes the use of military troops in domestic situations, saying it erodes trust between the military and civilians. He also implicitly criticizes current Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and other officials for militarizing the response.

So, the key points are: Mattis's criticism of Trump for division, the context of his past silence, the trigger being Trump's response to George Floyd protests, the use of military troops, and the threat to American unity. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include Mattis's main arguments and the reasons behind his change in stance. Also, mention his concern about the military's role and the erosion of trust. Let me structure it to flow logically: start with Mattis's criticism, his past stance on not criticizing, the trigger event, his arguments against military use, and the overall threat to unity. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail.
