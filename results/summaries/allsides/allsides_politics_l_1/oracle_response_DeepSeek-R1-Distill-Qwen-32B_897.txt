Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article is about General Mattis criticizing President Trump for not trying to unite the American people and instead dividing them. Mattis contrasts this with the American ethos of unity, referencing historical events like the Normandy invasion. He mentions his past stance on not criticizing a sitting president but feels compelled now because he sees the American experiment being threatened.

I should identify the key points: Mattis's criticism, Trump's divisiveness, the contrast with American unity, historical references, Mattis's past silence, the George Floyd protests, military's role, and his implicit criticism of current officials.

Now, I need to use the provided moral words: try, unite, pretend, divide, effort, leadership, bled, defend, invasion, destroying, surmount, crisis, protecting, threatened, actions, response, killing, support, ordered, violate, provide, called, dominate, militarizing, conflict, erodes, keeping, understand.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I should keep it under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. I think I've covered all necessary points and used the required words effectively.

SUMMARY: General Mattis criticizes President Trump for failing to unite the American people, instead dividing the nation through deliberate efforts. Mattis contrasts this with the American ethos of unity, referencing historical examples like the Normandy invasion, where the U.S. answered "Divide and Conquer" with "In Union there is Strength." He argues that Trump's actions threaten the American experiment, particularly in response to the police killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests. Mattis condemns the use of military troops for domestic policing, calling it a violation of constitutional rights and a misuse of the military's role. He criticizes the militarization of domestic responses, which erodes trust between the military and civilian society. Mattis emphasizes that maintaining public order is the responsibility of civilian leaders, not the military. His statement reflects a crisis of leadership, where the nation must surmount division and restore unity, as past generations bled to defend the nation's promise. END OF SUMMARY.
