SUMMARY: In a powerful statement, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis condemns President Donald Trump's leadership, highlighting his deliberate attempts to divide the American people and his failure to unite the country. Mattis, a former general who once served under Trump, breaks his silence and asserts that the American experiment is directly threatened by the president's actions. He criticizes Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, specifically denouncing the use of the military to violate the constitutional rights of citizens and create a photo opportunity for the president. Mattis emphasizes the importance of unity and contrasts it with Nazi ideology, reminding Americans that their strength lies in their union. He also implicitly criticizes the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for militarizing the response to the protests and eroding the trusted bond between the military and civilian society. Mattis' statement underscores the moral responsibility of civilian leaders to protect the rights and well-being of their citizens.
