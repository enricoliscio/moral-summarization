SUMMARY: In a scathing statement, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis condemns President Donald Trump for deliberately dividing the American people and failing to provide mature leadership. Mattis highlights the contrast between Trump's actions and the American ethos of unity, drawing a line between Trump's response to the George Floyd protests and Nazi ideology. He criticizes the militarization of the response to the protests and the violation of Constitutional rights, implicitly rebuking current Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and other senior officials. Mattis emphasizes the importance of civilian leadership in maintaining public order and respecting the apolitical nature of the military. He believes that the American experiment is under threat by Trump's actions and that unity is needed to overcome the current crisis. Mattis concludes that he owes his silence no longer and speaks out against the president he once served.
