SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Trump's divisive actions, which he believes threaten the American experiment. Mattis argues that Trump's efforts to divide the country are a deliberate attempt to undermine the nation's unity, which is a fundamental strength of American civil society. He criticizes the president's response to the George Floyd protests, particularly the use of troops to violate citizens' Constitutional rights. Mattis emphasizes the importance of upholding the moral ground between the military and civilian society, and urges Americans to unite without Trump's leadership. He believes that the country can overcome this crisis by drawing on its inherent strengths and rejecting the militarization of public order. END OF SUMMARY.
