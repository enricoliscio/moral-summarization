Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts with Mattis saying Trump doesn't try to unite the country and instead divides people. He contrasts this with the American ethos of unity, even referencing the Normandy invasion and the Nazi slogan. Mattis mentions that he didn't criticize Trump while in office, but now feels it's necessary because Trump's actions are threatening the country's unity.

He specifically calls out Trump's response to George Floyd's death and the protests, saying it's inappropriate for troops to be used for photo ops. Mattis also criticizes the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, and others for militarizing the response to protests.

I should highlight Mattis's shift from not criticizing to now speaking out, his reasons related to Trump's divisiveness, the mention of the protests, and his concerns about the military's role. Also, his reference to the Constitution and the oath he took is important.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Mattis's criticism of Trump's divisiveness, his change in stance after leaving office, the specific incident with the protests, and his concerns about military involvement in domestic issues.

I should structure it to first state Mattis's main criticism, then explain his reasons, mention the specific events, and conclude with his broader concerns about the military's role. Make sure it's concise and captures all essential elements without getting too detailed.

Let me put that together in a clear, concise manner, making sure to include Mattis's quotes where necessary to emphasize his points. I'll avoid any unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.
