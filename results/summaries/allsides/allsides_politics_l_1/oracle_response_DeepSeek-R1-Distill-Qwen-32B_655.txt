Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis's criticism of Trump, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article talks about Mattis, a former Pentagon official, who is openly criticizing Trump for not trying to unite the country and instead dividing it. He compares this to Nazi ideology and emphasizes the importance of unity. Mattis had previously refrained from criticizing Trump but now feels it's necessary because he believes Trump's actions are threatening the American experiment. Specifically, Mattis is upset about the military's role in the protests following George Floyd's killing. He mentions that the military should only be used when requested by state governors and that militarizing the response creates a conflict between the military and civilians, eroding trust.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words include: try, unite, pretend, divide, effort, leadership, bled, defend, invasion, destroying, surmount, crisis, protecting, threatened, actions, response, killing, support, ordered, violate, provide, called, 'dominate', militarizing, conflict, erodes, keeping, understand.

I should structure the summary to highlight Mattis's points about Trump's failure to unite, the consequences of division, the comparison to Nazi tactics, the military's inappropriate role, and the erosion of trust. I need to make sure each of these points uses the moral terms provided.

Let me start by stating Mattis's criticism of Trump for not trying to unite and instead dividing the country. Then mention the consequences of this leadership. Next, include his comparison to Nazi ideology and the need for unity. Then, explain the specific issue with the military's response to the protests, including the photo op and the orders to violate rights. Finally, address the criticism of the current defense secretary and the negative impact of militarizing the response, leading to conflict and eroded trust.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll also make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate, such as 'unite,' 'divide,' 'leadership,' 'protecting,' 'threatened,''response,' 'killing,''support,' 'ordered,' 'violate,''militarizing,' 'conflict,' and 'erodes.'

Let me put this together step by step, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary terms and maintains the moral tone of the original article.
