SUMMARY:

Former US Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly condemned President Donald Trump's divisive leadership, stating that Trump is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Mattis criticizes Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, particularly the use of troops to violate citizens' constitutional rights and create a "bizarre photo op" for the president. Mattis argues that the militarization of the response sets up a false conflict between the military and civilian society, eroding the trust between the two. He calls for unity and a return to the American ethos of "In Union there is Strength," contrasting it with the Nazi ideology of "Divide and Conquer." Mattis, who had previously remained silent about Trump, believes the president's actions directly threaten the American experiment.
