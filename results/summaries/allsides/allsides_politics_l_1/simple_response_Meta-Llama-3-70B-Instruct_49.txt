SUMMARY:

Former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has broken his silence to condemn President Donald Trump's divisive leadership, citing the president's response to the George Floyd protests as the trigger. Mattis argues that Trump's actions have deliberately divided the American people, contrasting with the nation's ethos of unity. He recalls the Nazi slogan "Divide and Conquer" and urges Americans to summon unity, as "In Union there is Strength." Mattis criticizes the militarization of the response to protests, which erodes the moral ground between the military and civilian society. He emphasizes that keeping public order is the responsibility of civilian leaders, not the military. Mattis's statement marks a shift from his previous stance of not criticizing a sitting president, as he believes the American experiment is now directly threatened by Trump's actions. Mattis's words serve as a call to action, urging Americans to unite and defend their country's values.
