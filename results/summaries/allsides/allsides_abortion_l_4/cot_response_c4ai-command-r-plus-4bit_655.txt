SUMMARY: 
It is ridiculous and shaming to suggest that a world without abortion is desirable or even possible. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives, protects their autonomy, and reflects their unique circumstances. While it is good to aim for better access to contraception and family planning, broken condoms, missed pills, and changing circumstances will always result in the need for abortion care. Politicians and advocates who frame abortion as a problem to be solved or a social ill to be eradicated are denying reality and stigmatizing women who choose abortion for a variety of moral, health, and practical reasons. The focus of the reproductive rights movement should be on empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves, not on eradicating abortion or reducing its numbers. By acknowledging the necessity and morality of abortion care, we can have nuanced conversations about the complexity of personal views without sacrificing the health and autonomy of women.
