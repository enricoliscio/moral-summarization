SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politicians often suggest that a world without abortion is desirable. This stance is misguided and denies reality. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives, protects their autonomy, and is incredibly safe and common. Advocating for a world without abortion adds to the stigma surrounding it and erases the fact that women choose abortion for various reasons. Broken condoms, missed pills, and changing circumstances can all lead to unwanted pregnancies. We should focus on supporting women's health and ensuring they can make the best medical decisions for themselves, rather than on reducing abortion numbers. Suggesting that zero abortions is a goal aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric and ignores the unique situations women face. It's crucial to empower women to make informed choices based on their circumstances and ensure they have access to the necessary healthcare and planning. This approach should be the primary focus of policymakers and doctors, regardless of abortion rates.
