SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politician Wendy Davis stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance that has been echoed by many advocates and lawmakers to avoid being perceived as "extreme" on abortion rights. However, this position denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and vital aspect of women's healthcare. Doctors and medical experts emphasize that abortion saves women's lives, protects their autonomy, and is often chosen in various circumstances, including reproductive coercion and domestic violence. They argue that framing abortion as a necessary evil erases the fact that it is a safe and common medical procedure. Instead, the focus should be on supporting women's health and empowering them to make informed decisions based on their unique situations. Suggesting that a world without abortions is desirable contributes to stigma and shaming, denying the complexity of personal views on abortion. The goal should be to ensure women have access to the care they need, including safe and legal abortions, rather than striving for an unattainable and morally questionable goal of "zero abortions."
