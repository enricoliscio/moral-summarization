Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The main topic is about Wendy Davis's statement on wanting zero abortions, and the article argues against that idea. It mentions that abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy. There are quotes from doctors supporting this view. The article also discusses how politicians use such statements to appear moderate but it's unrealistic. I should highlight the key points: the impossibility of eliminating abortions, the medical necessity, the impact of policy on women's access, and the call for a more nuanced approach focusing on women's needs rather than numbers. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll condense each section without losing the essence. Make sure to include the counterarguments from the medical professionals and the critique of the "zero abortions" goal.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Wendy Davis's statement that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," arguing that such a stance is unrealistic and harmful. It highlights that abortion is a necessary medical procedure for women's health, autonomy, and safety, and that eliminating it is impossible. Doctors emphasize that abortion saves lives, addresses unintended pregnancies, and accounts for human error and changing circumstances. Politicians who frame abortion as a problem to be eradinated risk stigmatizing it and undermining access to essential care. The article advocates for policies that prioritize women's health and circumstances over reducing abortion numbers, urging a nuanced approach that respects individual decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
