Alright, I need to summarize this article about Wendy Davis's comments on abortion. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. So, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Wendy Davis saying that the goal should be zero abortions, which is a common stance among politicians to appear moderate. The author criticizes this view, arguing it's unrealistic and denies the necessity of abortion. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support the point that abortion is essential for women's health and autonomy.

I need to highlight that the article opposes the "zero abortions" goal, emphasizing that abortion is a necessary medical procedure. The author also points out that framing it as a problem to solve is harmful and ignores the complexities of women's lives. They mention factors like access to contraception, economic circumstances, and the reality of birth control failures.

The summary should reflect the moral stance that abortion is a valid medical choice and that policies should support women's health, not just reduce abortion rates. I'll make sure to include the experts' perspectives and the critique of the "zero abortions" narrative.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Wendy Davis's statement, the critique, the experts' arguments, and the conclusion about focusing on women's health. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's concise yet comprehensive, preserving the original moral framing.
