SUMMARY: During a recent interview, politician Wendy Davis stated that the goal should be to see "zero abortions," a common talking point used by many advocates and lawmakers to avoid being perceived as extreme on abortion rights. However, this position denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and safe medical procedure that protects women's lives and autonomy. Doctors and experts in the field emphasize that abortion is sometimes required to save a woman's life and that circumstances can change, making even wanted pregnancies unwanted. They argue that the focus should be on supporting women's health and ensuring they have access to the care they need, rather than stigmatizing abortion as a problem to be solved. Suggesting that a world without abortion is desirable contributes to stigma and ignores the fact that women will always need abortion care for various reasons. Instead, the goal should be to empower women to make the best medical decisions for themselves based on their unique situations.
