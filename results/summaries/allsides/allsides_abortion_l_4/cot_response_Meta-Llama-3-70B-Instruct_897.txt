SUMMARY:
Wendy Davis, a politician, suggested that the goal should be to see "zero abortions," implying that a world without abortion is desirable. However, this stance is deemed "ridiculous" and "shaming" by Dr. Anne Davis, as it denies the reality that women will always need abortion care. Dr. Lin-Fan Wang agrees, stating that there will always be a need for abortion due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion and human error. The article argues that framing abortion as a "necessary evil" rather than a medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy is problematic. Instead, policymakers should focus on ensuring women have access to healthcare and making informed decisions, rather than striving for a "false" goal of zero abortions. This approach is essential for preserving women's health and autonomy. END OF SUMMARY.
