SUMMARY:
The article discusses the moral framing of abortion in political discourse and how it affects the perception of reproductive rights. It criticizes the notion that a "world without abortion" is a desirable goal, as it denies the reality that women will always need safe and legal abortion care. This framing erases the fact that abortion is a necessary and moral choice for women in various circumstances, including those involving health, autonomy, and reproductive coercion. It also ignores the fact that birth control is not always accessible or effective, and that circumstances can change, making even wanted pregnancies unwanted. The article advocates for a shift in the moral framing of abortion, focusing on women's health, autonomy, and unique situations rather than stigmatizing abortion as a problem to be solved or a social ill. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing abortion as a safe and common medical procedure, and calls for policies and advocacy that empower women to make their own moral decisions regarding their reproductive health. This approach respects the moral agency of women and ensures their access to essential healthcare.
