SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis, a politician, recently stated that the goal should be to see "zero abortions," implying that a world without abortion is desirable. However, this stance denies reality and perpetuates stigma around abortion care. Dr. Anne Davis, a second-trimester abortion provider, emphasizes that abortion is sometimes necessary to save a woman's life, and framing it as a necessary evil rather than a medical procedure erases the autonomy of women. Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, a doctor of family medicine, agrees that there will always be a need for abortion due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion, domestic violence, and human error. Instead of focusing on reducing the number of abortions, policies should prioritize supporting women's health and autonomy. By doing so, we can ensure that women are empowered to make the best medical decisions for themselves. The goal should be to provide safe, necessary, and stigma-free care, rather than advocating for a false and unattainable goal of "zero abortions."
