Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Wendy Davis's stance on abortion, and it's critical of her goal of zero abortions. 

First, I should identify the main points. Davis says the goal is zero abortions, but the author argues that's unrealistic and harmful. The article uses experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support this. They point out that abortion is necessary for health, autonomy, and various life circumstances. The author also criticizes the framing as anti-abortion rhetoric, which stigmatizes women.

I need to keep the moral perspective, so I'll emphasize that abortion is a necessary medical procedure and that stigmatizing it is wrong. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key arguments against the zero-abortion goal.

Let me structure it: Start with Davis's statement, then the critique, mention the experts' points, and conclude with the call for policy based on women's health, not numbers.

I should make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence without losing the moral argument. Avoid any markdown, just plain text after the tokens.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a position she shares with many politicians to appear moderate. However, the article argues this stance is unrealistic and harmful. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives, improves health, and protects women's autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion will always be needed due to factors like contraceptive failure, life-changing circumstances, and access barriers. Framing abortion as a problem to eliminate stigmatizes women and mirrors anti-abortion rhetoric. The focus should instead be on policies that support women's health and autonomy, rather than reducing abortion numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
