SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights during a campaign trail interview, Wendy Davis suggested that a world with zero abortions is ideal. This stance is commonly used by politicians to avoid being perceived as extreme on abortion rights. However, it denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and safe medical procedure that protects women's health, autonomy, and lives. Experts emphasize that abortion is often a lifesaving measure and that circumstances can render even wanted pregnancies untenable. They argue for policies and talking points that focus on supporting women's unique healthcare needs and decisions rather than stigmatizing abortion as a problem to be eradicated. This approach empowers women to make the best medical choices for themselves based on their circumstances, ensuring they receive the care and planning they deserve.
