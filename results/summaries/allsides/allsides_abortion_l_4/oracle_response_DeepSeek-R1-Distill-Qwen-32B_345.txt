Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article discusses Wendy Davis's statement about wanting zero abortions and the author's critique of that stance. The author argues that abortion is necessary and that aiming for zero is unrealistic and harmful. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support the point that abortion is a medical necessity, not something to eliminate.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like healthcare, care, necessary, stigma, saves, supports, etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the critique against the "zero abortions" goal.

I'll start by stating that Wendy Davis and others promote the idea of zero abortions as a moderate stance, but the author argues it's unrealistic. Then, mention the experts' points about abortion being necessary for women's health and autonomy. Highlight the moral implications like stigma and coercion. Conclude by emphasizing the need to focus on supporting women rather than reducing numbers.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making the summary too long.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis, like many politicians, advocates for a "world without abortion," framing it as a moderate stance to avoid being labeled extreme. However, the author argues this position denies reality, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis emphasizes that claiming abortion is never necessary is false and dangerous, while Dr. Lin-Fan Wang notes that circumstances like financial hardship or relationship dynamics often lead to unwanted pregnancies, making abortion essential. The author criticizes the "zero abortions" goal as unrealistic and harmful, as it stigmatizes a safe and common medical procedure. Instead, policies should focus on supporting women's healthcare, planning, and access, ensuring they can make informed decisions without coercion or violence. The article advocates for nuanced conversations that prioritize women's health and autonomy over reducing abortion numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
