SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis, a politician, recently stated that the goal should be to have "zero abortions" and that women should receive proper healthcare and planning to achieve this goal. However, this stance is criticized as it denies the reality that women will always need abortion care. Doctors and advocates argue that abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. They point out that women choose abortion in various circumstances, and that there will always be a need for abortion due to factors like reproductive coercion, lack of access to contraception, and human error. The article argues that instead of focusing on reducing the number of abortions, policymakers should prioritize supporting women's health and autonomy. By framing abortion as a necessary evil, politicians like Davis are perpetuating stigma and ignoring the complexities of women's experiences. END OF SUMMARY.
