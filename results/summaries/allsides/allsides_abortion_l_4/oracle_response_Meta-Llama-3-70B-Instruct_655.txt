SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis's statement on the campaign trail, suggesting that a world without abortion is a desirable goal, is criticized for denying reality and perpetuating stigma. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Framing it as a necessary evil or a social ill to be eradicated is false and sacrifices the health of patients. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, both reproductive health experts, argue that women will always need abortion care, and that the focus should be on supporting their health and autonomy, rather than reducing the number of abortions. They highlight the complexity of women's experiences, including reproductive coercion, domestic violence, and financial constraints. The authors advocate for policies that empower women to make informed medical decisions, rather than denying them basic care. By calling for "zero abortions," politicians like Davis are perpetuating a harmful and unrealistic goal that mirrors the rhetoric of anti-abortion lawmakers. Instead, we should focus on providing safe, accessible, and stigma-free healthcare. END OF SUMMARY.
