SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politicians often suggest that a world without abortion is desirable, framing it as a moderate position to avoid being labeled as extreme. However, this stance denies the reality that women will always require abortion care for various reasons, including medical necessity, autonomy, and changing circumstances. Abortion providers and doctors emphasize that abortion is a safe and common medical procedure, and that each woman's situation is unique. They argue that the focus should be on supporting women's health and empowering them to make the best decisions for themselves, rather than on stigmatizing abortion or treating it as a problem to be eradicated. Advocating for zero abortions aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric and contributes to stigma, when the goal should be to support women and ensure they have access to the care they need.
