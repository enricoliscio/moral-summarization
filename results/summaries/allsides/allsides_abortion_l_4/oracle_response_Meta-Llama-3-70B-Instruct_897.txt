SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis's statement on the campaign trail, suggesting that the goal should be to see "zero abortions," is a flawed and misleading position. This stance denies the reality that women will always need abortion care and perpetuates stigma around the issue. Dr. Anne Davis, a second-trimester abortion provider, emphasizes that abortion is sometimes necessary to save a woman's life, and to claim otherwise is a false and harmful narrative. Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, a doctor of family medicine, highlights that even with improved access to contraception, women will still face challenges and need abortion care due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion and human error. The focus should be on supporting women's autonomy and healthcare, rather than framing abortion as a problem to be solved. By advocating for policies that prioritize women's health and unique circumstances, we can ensure that they receive the care they deserve, free from stigma and coercion. END OF SUMMARY.
