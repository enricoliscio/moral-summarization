SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, who suggest that the goal of reproductive rights should be to have "zero abortions." This stance is seen as a denial of reality, as women will always need access to abortion care. The article argues that framing abortion as a necessary evil or a problem to be solved erases the fact that women choose abortion in various circumstances, and that it is a medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy. Instead of focusing on reducing the number of abortions, policymakers should prioritize ensuring that women have access to healthcare, contraception, and the ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. The article concludes that the goal should be to support women's health and autonomy, rather than striving for an unrealistic and stigmatizing goal of "zero abortions."
