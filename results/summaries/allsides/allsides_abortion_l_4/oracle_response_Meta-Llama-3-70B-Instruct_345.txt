SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis, a politician, recently suggested that the goal should be to have "zero abortions," implying that a world without abortion is desirable. However, this stance denies reality and perpetuates stigma around abortion care. Women will always need abortion care, and framing it as a necessary evil rather than a medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy is harmful. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, both medical professionals, emphasize that abortion is necessary to save women's lives and that there will always be a need for it. They highlight the importance of ensuring women have access to healthcare, planning, and safe medical procedures, rather than stigmatizing abortion. The focus should be on supporting women's health and autonomy, rather than reducing the number of abortions. By advocating for policies that prioritize women's care, we can work towards a reality where women are empowered to make the best medical decisions for themselves, free from coercion and violence.
