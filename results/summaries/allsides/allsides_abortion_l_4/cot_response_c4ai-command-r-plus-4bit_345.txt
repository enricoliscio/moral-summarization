SUMMARY:
Politicians and advocates often suggest that a world without abortion is desirable, framing it as a necessary evil and a problem to be solved. This stance denies reality and stigmatizes abortion as something negative, erasing the fact that abortion is a medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Doctors and experts affirm that abortion is often necessary for various reasons, including reproductive coercion, birth control failures, and changing circumstances. The focus should be on empowering women to make the best decisions for their health and well-being, recognizing that each woman's situation is unique. Suggesting that "zero abortions" is a goal is not only false but aligns with the harmful narrative of anti-abortion lawmakers who deny women access to basic medical care. Instead, we should strive for a world where abortion is safe, accessible, and free from shame, recognizing that women will always need abortion care for various moral, health, and practical reasons.
