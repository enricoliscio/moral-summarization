SUMMARY:
Wendy Davis, a politician, recently stated that the goal should be to see "zero abortions," suggesting that a world without abortion is desirable. However, this position is deemed "ridiculous" and "shaming" by some reproductive rights advocates, who argue that women will always need abortion care. Dr. Anne Davis, a second-trimester abortion provider, asserts that abortion is sometimes necessary to save a woman's life, and that denying this reality is a "lie." Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, a doctor of family medicine, emphasizes that there will always be a need for abortion due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion, financial constraints, and human error. The article argues that instead of striving for "zero abortions," policymakers should focus on empowering women to make informed medical decisions and providing them with access to necessary care.
