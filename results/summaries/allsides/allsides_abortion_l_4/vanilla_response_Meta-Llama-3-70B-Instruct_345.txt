SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, who suggest that a world without abortion is a desirable goal. This stance is seen as a attempt to appear moderate and avoid being labeled as "extreme" on abortion rights. However, doctors and reproductive rights advocates argue that this position denies reality and stigmatizes women who need abortion care. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Women will always need access to abortion, regardless of the availability of contraception, due to various circumstances such as reproductive coercion, provider misconceptions, and human error. The article argues that policymakers should focus on supporting women's unique situations and ensuring they have access to medical care, rather than striving for a unrealistic goal of zero abortions. By framing abortion as a necessary evil, politicians erase the fact that women choose abortion in various circumstances and deserve autonomy over their bodies.
