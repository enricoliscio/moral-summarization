SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, who suggest that the goal of reproductive rights should be to achieve "zero abortions." This stance is seen as a denial of reality, as women will always need access to abortion care. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, both medical professionals, argue that abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. They point out that women choose abortion in various circumstances, and that contraception is not 100% effective. The article advocates for a nuanced conversation about abortion, focusing on women's individual experiences and needs, rather than striving for a unrealistic goal of eliminating abortions. It emphasizes the importance of empowering women to make informed medical decisions, rather than stigmatizing abortion.
