SUMMARY:
It is morally wrong to frame abortion as a problem to be solved or a social ill to be eradicated. Advocating for a world without abortion denies reality and stigmatizes women who choose abortion for a variety of reasons, including protecting their health and autonomy. Abortion is a common medical procedure that should be safe and accessible. Politicians and advocates who suggest that abortion is a necessary evil erase the importance of women's circumstances and autonomy in their decisions. This framing also fails to acknowledge the reality that birth control is not always accessible or effective, and that circumstances can change, making even wanted pregnancies unwanted. Doctors and policymakers should focus on empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves, recognizing that each woman's situation is unique. The goal should be to support women's health and well-being, not to reduce the number of abortions. This stigmatization of abortion as an "evil" procedure is not only factually incorrect but also aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric that denies women access to basic healthcare.
