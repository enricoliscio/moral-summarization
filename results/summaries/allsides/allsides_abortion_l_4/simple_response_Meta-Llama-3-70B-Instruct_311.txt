SUMMARY:

The article critiques politicians, including Wendy Davis, who suggest that the goal should be to have "zero abortions." This stance is seen as a denial of reality, as women will always need abortion care. The author argues that this framing is harmful, as it perpetuates stigma and shame around abortion, and erases the fact that women choose abortion in various circumstances. Medical professionals, Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, emphasize that abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy. They highlight the complexities of women's experiences, including reproductive coercion, lack of access to contraception, and changing circumstances. The article concludes that policymakers should focus on empowering women to make informed medical decisions, rather than striving for an unrealistic "zero abortions" goal.
