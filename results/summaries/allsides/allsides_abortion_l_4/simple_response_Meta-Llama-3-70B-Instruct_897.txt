SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, for framing abortion as a necessary evil and striving for a "world without abortion." This approach denies reality, as women will always need abortion care due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion, lack of access to contraception, and human error. Abortion is a medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. By framing it as a problem to be solved, politicians perpetuate stigma and erase the fact that women choose abortion in diverse circumstances. Instead, the focus should be on empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves, based on their unique situations. The article argues that policymakers should prioritize women's health and support, rather than striving for a unrealistic goal of zero abortions. This approach aligns with the reproductive rights movement's objectives, which prioritize women's autonomy and access to necessary care.
