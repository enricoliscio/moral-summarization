Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Wendy Davis, a politician, who made a statement about wanting zero abortions, thinking it's a moderate stance. But the author argues that this is unrealistic because abortion is necessary in many cases. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support the point that abortion is a medical necessity and not something that can be eradicated. The article also touches on how policies should focus on women's health rather than the number of abortions. 

I should start the summary by mentioning Wendy Davis's statement and the author's criticism. Then, include the experts' points about the necessity of abortion. Also, highlight the idea that focusing on women's health is more important than reducing abortion numbers. Need to keep it under 200 words. Let me make sure to include the main arguments without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis, a politician, recently stated that the goal should be to achieve zero abortions, a stance she believes is moderate. However, this perspective is criticized as unrealistic, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure in many cases. Experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion saves women's lives and is essential due to factors like failed contraception, changing circumstances, and access issues. The article argues that promoting zero abortions is not only unattainable but also harmful, as it stigmatizes a common and safe medical procedure. Instead, policies should focus on women's health and autonomy, ensuring they can make informed decisions without stigma. The author concludes that the conversation should prioritize women's needs over reducing abortion numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
