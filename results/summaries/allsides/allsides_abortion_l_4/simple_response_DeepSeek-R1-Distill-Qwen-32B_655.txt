Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Wendy Davis's statement on wanting zero abortions and the author's critique of that stance. 

First, I should identify the main points. Wendy Davis, like Bill Clinton before her, says the goal should be zero abortions. The author argues that this is unrealistic and harmful because abortion is necessary and should be seen as a medical procedure, not something to eliminate.

I need to include that the author believes this stance is a moderate approach to avoid being labeled extreme, but it's denying reality. The article also brings in experts, Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, who explain why abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy. They mention factors like birth control failure, life changes, and coercion, showing that abortion will always be needed.

The author criticizes the "zero abortions" goal as shaming and similar to anti-abortion rhetoric. They argue that the focus should be on supporting women's health, not reducing abortion numbers.

I should structure the summary to highlight Davis's statement, the critique, the experts' points, and the conclusion that the goal should be about supporting women, not eliminating abortions. Keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective that abortion is a necessary and safe procedure.

Let me draft that concisely, making sure to include all key points without losing the moral argument.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance she shares with other politicians to appear moderate. However, the author argues this position is unrealistic and harmful, as it denies the necessity of abortion as a medical procedure that saves lives and respects women's autonomy. Experts, including Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, emphasize that abortion will always be needed due to factors like birth control failure, life changes, and coercion. The author criticizes the "zero abortions" narrative as shaming and akin to anti-abortion rhetoric, advocating instead for policies that focus on supporting women's health and circumstances rather than reducing abortion numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
