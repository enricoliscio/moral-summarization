Okay, I need to summarize this article about Wendy Davis and her stance on abortion. The article starts by mentioning her interview where she said the goal should be zero abortions, similar to Bill Clinton's approach. She's trying to present a moderate position to avoid being labeled extreme. But the article argues that this is unrealistic because abortion will always be necessary.

The author brings in Dr. Anne Davis, who points out that abortion does save lives, and denying that is harmful. Another doctor, Dr. Wang, explains that even with better access to contraception, issues like financial hardship, domestic violence, and contraceptive failure mean abortions are still needed. The article criticizes the "zero abortions" goal as unrealistic and stigmatizing, suggesting it's the same line as anti-abortion politicians.

The main points are: abortion is a necessary medical procedure, it's not a problem to eliminate, and policies should focus on supporting women's health rather than reducing abortion numbers. The summary should highlight these arguments concisely, under 200 words.

However, the article argues this position is unrealistic, as abortion will always be necessary. Dr. Anne Davis emphasizes that abortion saves lives, and denying this is harmful. Dr. Lin-Fan Wang adds that even with improved access to contraception, factors like financial hardship, domestic violence, and contraceptive failure mean abortions remain essential. The article criticizes the "zero abortions" goal as stigmatizing and similar to anti-abortion rhetoric. It advocates for policies focusing on women's health and autonomy, rather than reducing abortion numbers. END OF SUMMARY.
