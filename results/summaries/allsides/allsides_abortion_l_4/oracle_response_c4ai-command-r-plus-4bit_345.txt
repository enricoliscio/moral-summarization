SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politician Wendy Davis stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance that has been echoed by many advocates and lawmakers. However, this position denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and safe medical procedure that protects women's lives, autonomy, and health. Doctors and experts in the field affirm that abortion is sometimes needed to save a woman's life and that circumstances can change, making even wanted pregnancies unwanted. They emphasize the need to remove the stigma surrounding abortion and focus on supporting women's unique situations and empowering them to make the best medical decisions for themselves. Suggesting that abortion is a problem to be solved or a social ill to be eradicated ignores the fact that abortion is a common and safe procedure. Policymakers and doctors should instead strive to ensure women have access to the healthcare and planning they deserve, removing barriers to contraception and addressing issues of reproductive coercion and violence. The objective should be to support women's health and well-being, not to achieve an unrealistic and potentially harmful goal of "zero abortions."
