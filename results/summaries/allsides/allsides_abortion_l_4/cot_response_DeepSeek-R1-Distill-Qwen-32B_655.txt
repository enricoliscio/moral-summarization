Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about Wendy Davis saying she wants zero abortions, but the author argues that's unrealistic and harmful. Words like "extreme," "deny reality," "stigma," "sacrifices," "necessary evil," "erases," "challenges," "coercion," "ineffective," "unwanted," "unique," "empowered," "thoughtful," "support," and "numbers" stand out as having moral implications.

Now, for the summary. I need to capture the main points: Davis's stance, the author's criticism, the necessity of abortion, and the call for policies that support women. I should include the moral words to maintain the original framing.

I'll start by mentioning Davis's goal of zero abortions. Then, explain why that's unrealisticâ€”abortion is necessary for health and autonomy. Highlight the medical perspective and the reality of unintended pregnancies. Conclude by emphasizing the need for policies that focus on women's health, not reducing abortion numbers.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral language is preserved.

* thoughtful
* support
* numbers

**SUMMARY:**

Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance she shares with other politicians to appear moderate and avoid being labeled "extreme." However, the article argues that this position "denies reality" and perpetuates harmful "stigma" around abortion. Abortion is not merely a "necessary evil" but a critical medical procedure that saves lives and protects women's autonomy. Doctors emphasize that abortion will always be "necessary" due to factors like contraceptive failure, changing circumstances, and domestic violence. The article criticizes the idea of eliminating abortions as unrealistic and harmful, advocating instead for policies that "empower" women to make decisions based on their unique circumstances. Focusing on reducing the "numbers" of abortions, rather than supporting women's health and rights, is misguided. The goal should be to ensure women have access to the care they need, not to eliminate abortion entirely. END OF SUMMARY.
