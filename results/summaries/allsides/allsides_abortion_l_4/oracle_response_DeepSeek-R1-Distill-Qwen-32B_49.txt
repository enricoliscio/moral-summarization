Okay, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Wendy Davis's statement on abortion, where she says the goal should be zero abortions. The author argues that this is a flawed position because it's unrealistic and stigmatizing. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support the idea that abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words the author used: healthcare, planning, safe, care, stigma, necessary, false, base, sacrifices, frame, saves, protects, erases, coercion, violence, calling, advocating, deny, support.

So, the summary should highlight that the idea of zero abortions is unrealistic, stigmatizing, and ignores the reality of women's needs. It should mention the necessity of abortion as a safe medical procedure, the role of coercion and violence, and the importance of supporting women's health rather than focusing on numbers.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Wendy Davis's stance, then the author's counterarguments using the experts, and conclude with the call for a more nuanced approach that supports women's health.

Let me make sure I include the key moral terms and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance many politicians adopt to appear moderate. However, this framing is unrealistic and stigmatizing, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives and protects women's autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion is essential due to factors like coercion, violence, and the limitations of birth control. The article argues that advocating for zero abortions denies the complexity of women's circumstances and prioritizes numbers over their health and rights. Instead, policymakers should focus on supporting women's access to care, removing barriers, and respecting their autonomy. The moral framing highlights the necessity of abortion as a safe, necessary procedure, and the importance of avoiding stigmatizing language. END OF SUMMARY.
