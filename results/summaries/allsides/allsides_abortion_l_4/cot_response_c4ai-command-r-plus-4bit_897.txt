SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political implications of abortion, criticizing the stance that a world without abortion is desirable or achievable. It argues that this position denies reality and stigmatizes women who choose abortion for various reasons, including life-saving medical necessities and autonomy. While calling for the removal of barriers to contraception access, the article emphasizes that abortion is a safe, common, and morally neutral medical procedure. Advocating for "zero abortions" is false and harmful, similar to anti-abortion lawmakers denying women essential medical care. The article promotes a nuanced view, acknowledging the complexity of personal beliefs while focusing on empowering women to make thoughtful decisions regarding their unique circumstances. It emphasizes the need for policies and conversations that support women's health and respect their autonomy, regardless of abortion numbers.
