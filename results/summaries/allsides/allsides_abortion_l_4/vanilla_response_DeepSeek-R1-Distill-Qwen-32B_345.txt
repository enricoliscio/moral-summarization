Alright, I need to summarize this article about Wendy Davis and her stance on abortion. The article starts by talking about her saying the goal should be zero abortions, similar to what other politicians have done before. She believes this makes her position moderate and avoids being seen as extreme. But the author argues that this is unrealistic because women will always need abortion care.

The article then brings in experts, like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, who explain that abortion is necessary to save women's lives and that it's not just about the number of abortions but the circumstances surrounding each case. They mention issues like access to contraception, domestic violence, and economic factors that lead to unwanted pregnancies.

The author criticizes the idea of aiming for zero abortions, pointing out that it's not only impossible but also ignores the reality of women's lives. They argue that policies should focus on supporting women's health and autonomy rather than reducing abortion rates. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, making sure to include the main arguments against the "zero abortions" goal and the experts' perspectives.

I should structure the summary to first mention Wendy Davis's statement, then the criticism of it being unrealistic, followed by the experts' viewpoints on why abortion is necessary, and finally the call for policies that support women's health. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I need to be concise but cover all the key points.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis, during a campaign interview, stated that the goal should be to achieve zero abortions, a stance she believes presents a moderate position. However, the article argues that this view denies reality, as women will always need abortion care. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion is necessary to save lives and address various circumstances, including access to contraception, domestic violence, and economic challenges. The article criticizes the "zero abortions" narrative, calling it unrealistic and harmful, as it ignores the complexities of women's lives. Instead, policies should focus on supporting women's health and autonomy, rather than reducing abortion rates. The author asserts that abortion is a medical procedure, and advocating for zero abortions aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric, which should not be repeated. END OF SUMMARY.
