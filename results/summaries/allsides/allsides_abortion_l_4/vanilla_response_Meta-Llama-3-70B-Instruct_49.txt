SUMMARY:

Texas politician Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be to have "zero abortions," suggesting that a world without abortion is desirable. However, this stance is criticized as denying reality and stigmatizing women who need abortion care. Medical professionals argue that abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Women will always need abortion care, and circumstances such as reproductive coercion, lack of access to contraception, and human error ensure that abortion will always be necessary. Framing abortion as a necessary evil or a problem to be solved erases the complexity of women's experiences and decisions. Instead, policymakers should focus on supporting women's health and autonomy, rather than striving for a unrealistic goal of zero abortions.

END OF SUMMARY.
