SUMMARY:
Wendy Davis' statement on achieving "zero abortions" is morally wrong and denies reality. Abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. Framing it as a necessary evil or a social ill to be eradicated is shaming and false. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that women will always need abortion care, and it's not just about saving lives, but also about protecting women's health and autonomy. They argue that policymakers should focus on supporting women's unique circumstances, rather than trying to reduce the number of abortions. By doing so, we can ensure that women are empowered to make the best medical decisions for themselves. END OF SUMMARY.
