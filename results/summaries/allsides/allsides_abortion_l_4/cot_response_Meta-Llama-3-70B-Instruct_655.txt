SUMMARY:
Wendy Davis' statement on reproductive rights, suggesting that a world without abortions is a desirable goal, is morally wrong and denies reality. This position is often used by politicians to appear moderate, but it's a false and shaming narrative that erases the necessity of abortion care. Women will always need abortion care, and it's not just about saving lives, but also about protecting autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion is a medical procedure that saves women's lives and should not be stigmatized. They argue that policymakers should focus on supporting women's unique circumstances, rather than aiming for a unrealistic goal of zero abortions. This approach is not only false but also harmful, as it perpetuates a narrative that denies women basic medical care. END OF SUMMARY.
