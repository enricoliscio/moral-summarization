SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politician Wendy Davis stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance that many politicians take to avoid being perceived as extreme on abortion rights. However, this position denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and vital aspect of women's healthcare. Doctors and experts emphasize that abortion saves women's lives, protects their autonomy, and is often chosen in a variety of circumstances. They argue that framing abortion as a necessary evil erases the fact that it is a safe and common medical procedure. Instead, the focus should be on supporting women's health and ensuring they have access to the care they need, without stigma or shame. Advocating for "zero abortions" aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric and ignores the unique situations that women face. The article concludes that the priority should be empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves based on their individual circumstances, rather than focusing on arbitrary numerical goals.
