SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politicians often suggest that a world without abortion is desirable and claim that their goal is to reduce the number of abortions to zero. However, this stance denies the reality that abortion is a necessary and safe medical procedure that protects women's lives and autonomy. Abortion providers and doctors emphasize that abortion is often necessary to save women's lives and that circumstances can change, making even wanted pregnancies unwanted. They argue that focusing on reducing the number of abortions stigmatizes the procedure and ignores the unique situations of each woman. Instead, the focus should be on supporting women's health and ensuring they have access to the care they need, including safe and accessible abortion services. This approach empowers women to make informed decisions about their bodies and their health. Advocating for policies that deny women basic medical care, such as abortion, is harmful and reinforces stigma. It is crucial to recognize the complexity of abortion as a medical procedure and to respect women's autonomy in making decisions about their own healthcare.
