Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Wendy Davis and her stance on abortion. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Wendy Davis saying that the goal should be zero abortions, but she also mentions providing healthcare and planning. The author compares this to Bill Clinton's statement and points out that politicians use this line to appear moderate, avoiding being labeled extreme. But the author argues that this is denying reality because abortion will always be necessary.

Dr. Anne Davis is quoted saying that abortion does save women's lives, and denying that is a lie that affects policy. The article also mentions Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, who explains that even with better access to contraception, there are still barriers like trust issues with providers, misconceptions, and situations like domestic violence. Birth control isn't 100% effective, so there will always be unintended pregnancies. 

The author criticizes the idea of aiming for zero abortions, calling it a false and harmful narrative. They argue that abortion is a medical procedure that should be supported, and policies should focus on women's health and circumstances, not the number of abortions.

So, the main points are:
1. Wendy Davis and others promote zero abortions as a goal to appear moderate.
2. This is unrealistic because abortion is necessary for health and autonomy.
3. Politicians using this line are denying reality and stigmatizing abortion.
4. Doctors argue that abortion saves lives and is necessary in various circumstances.
5. The focus should be on supporting women's health, not reducing abortion numbers.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include that the goal of zero abortions is unrealistic, the reasons why (health, circumstances), and the call for policies that support women's health instead of reducing numbers.

Let me structure it: Start with Davis's statement, explain it's a moderate stance, then argue it's unrealistic. Mention the doctors' points about necessity and the reasons why abortion will always be needed. Conclude with the need to focus on women's health.

I think that covers all the main points concisely.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be zero abortions, a stance politicians often use to appear moderate. However, this idea is unrealistic, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives and respects women's autonomy. Doctors emphasize that abortion is needed in various circumstances, including health risks, unintended pregnancies, and changing life situations. The article argues that focusing on reducing abortion numbers is harmful, as it ignores the complexities of women's lives. Instead, policies should prioritize women's health and access to care, recognizing that abortion will always be necessary. END OF SUMMARY.
