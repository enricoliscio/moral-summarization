SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, who suggest that the goal of reproductive rights should be to have "zero abortions." This stance is seen as a moderate position to avoid being labeled as "extreme" on abortion rights, but it denies reality. Women will always need abortion care, and framing it as a necessary evil rather than a medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy is shaming and erases the complexity of women's experiences. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang argue that abortion is necessary to save women's lives and that there will always be a need for it, regardless of access to contraception and healthcare. The focus should be on empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves, rather than striving for a unrealistic goal of zero abortions.
