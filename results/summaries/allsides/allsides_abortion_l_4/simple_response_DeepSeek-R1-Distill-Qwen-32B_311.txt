Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article, which is about Wendy Davis's stance on abortion and the broader implications of her statement. The key here is to capture the moral arguments made in the text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Wendy Davis says she wants zero abortions, which is a common moderate stance. But the article argues that this is unrealistic and harmful because it stigmatizes abortion. Doctors point out that abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy. The article criticizes the "zero abortions" goal as it's used by anti-abortion lawmakers to restrict access.

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, focusing on the moral aspects. I should highlight that while Davis's intent is moderate, it's unrealistic and stigmatizing. Include the doctors' perspectives on abortion's necessity and the problems with the "zero abortions" narrative. Conclude by emphasizing the need to focus on women's health, not the number of abortions.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Davis's statement, the criticism, the doctors' points, and the conclusion about policy focus. Keep it concise but comprehensive, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be "zero abortions," a stance she shares with other politicians to appear moderate. However, this framing is unrealistic and harmful, as it denies the necessity of abortion for women's health and autonomy. Doctors emphasize that abortion is a critical medical procedure, often saving lives and addressing complex circumstances, such as unintended pregnancies, financial hardship, or reproductive coercion. The "zero abortions" narrative stigmatizes abortion and aligns with anti-abortion policies that restrict access to care. Instead, the focus should be on supporting women's health and autonomy, ensuring access to safe, affordable abortion care, and recognizing the unique circumstances of each woman. By prioritizing women's well-being over arbitrary goals, policymakers can better serve the needs of individuals and families. END OF SUMMARY.
