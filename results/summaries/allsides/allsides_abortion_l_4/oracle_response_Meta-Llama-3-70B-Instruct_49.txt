SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis's recent statement on the campaign trail, suggesting that a world without abortion is a desirable goal, is a misguided and harmful stance. This position denies the reality that women will always need abortion care and perpetuates stigma around the procedure. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, both medical professionals, emphasize that abortion is a necessary and lifesaving medical procedure that should not be framed as a necessary evil. They argue that even with increased access to contraception, women will still face challenges and need abortion care due to various circumstances, including reproductive coercion and domestic violence. The focus should be on supporting women's autonomy and health, rather than reducing the number of abortions. By advocating for policies that prioritize women's care and well-being, we can ensure that they receive the healthcare and planning they deserve. This approach is essential to protecting women's lives and promoting a safe and supportive environment. END OF SUMMARY.
