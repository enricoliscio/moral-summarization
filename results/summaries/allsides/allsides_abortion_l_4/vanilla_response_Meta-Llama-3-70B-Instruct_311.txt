SUMMARY:

Wendy Davis, a politician, stated that the goal should be to see "zero abortions" and that abortion care should be accessible to achieve this goal. However, this stance is criticized as denying reality and perpetuating stigma around abortion. Doctors and advocates argue that women will always need abortion care, and framing it as a necessary evil erases the autonomy and medical necessity of the procedure. Abortion is a safe and common medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy. The focus should be on empowering women to make informed decisions about their healthcare, rather than striving for a world without abortion. The article argues that policymakers should prioritize women's health and unique circumstances, rather than perpetuating unrealistic and harmful goals.
