Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Wendy Davis saying that the goal should be zero abortions, but the author argues that's unrealistic and harmful. They mention that abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy. There are quotes from doctors emphasizing that abortion saves lives and that it's a safe medical procedure. The author also criticizes politicians for using phrases like "zero abortions" to avoid being seen as extreme, which is a strategic move but not based in reality.

I need to make sure I include the morally framed words like healthcare, care, necessary, saves, protects, etc. The summary should reflect that the article opposes the idea of eliminating abortions and instead supports access and understanding each woman's situation.

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning Wendy Davis's statement, then the author's counterargument about it being unrealistic. Include the doctors' points about necessity and safety. Criticize the political framing and the impact on women's health. End by highlighting the need to focus on supporting women rather than reducing abortion numbers.

Let me check the word count to stay under 200 words. Make sure the summary flows logically and includes all key moral points without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be "zero abortions," a stance many politicians adopt to appear moderate and avoid being labeled extreme. However, the author argues this position is unrealistic and harmful, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives and protects women's autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion is essential for women's health, citing factors like unintended pregnancies, coercion, and economic challenges. The article criticizes the framing of abortion as a problem to be eradicated, instead advocating for policies that focus on women's healthcare, planning, and access to care. The "zero abortions" narrative, often used by anti-abortion lawmakers, perpetuates stigma and denies the reality of women's circumstances. The author urges policymakers to prioritize women's health and support their decision-making, rather than reducing abortion to a numbers game. END OF SUMMARY.
