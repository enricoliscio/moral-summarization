Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses Wendy Davis's statement about wanting zero abortions and how this approach is flawed. It argues that abortion is a necessary medical procedure, not something to eliminate. The author uses terms like healthcare, care, stigma, necessary, false, erases, coercion, violence, support, etc.

I should start by introducing Wendy Davis's stance and the critique. Then, mention the medical necessity of abortion, the reality of human error and changing circumstances, and the impact of framing on stigma. Finally, conclude with the need to focus on women's health and support.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each point ties back to the moral framing.

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each includes the relevant terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Also, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY.".

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis recently stated that the goal should be "zero abortions," a stance she shares with many politicians to appear moderate. However, this framing denies reality, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure that saves lives and protects women's autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis emphasizes that abortion is essential to save women's lives, and denying this is false and harmful. Similarly, Dr. Lin-Fan Wang highlights that women face barriers to contraception, such as cost, coercion, and access issues, making abortion a necessary option. Birth control's imperfection and life's unpredictability mean abortion will always be needed. Framing abortion as a problem to eliminate perpetuates stigma and erases the complexity of women's circumstances. The focus should be on healthcare, planning, and supporting women's unique situations, rather than advocating for a "zero abortions" goal. This approach aligns with the reality that abortion is a safe, common medical procedure, and denying this necessity sacrifices women's health and autonomy. END OF SUMMARY.
