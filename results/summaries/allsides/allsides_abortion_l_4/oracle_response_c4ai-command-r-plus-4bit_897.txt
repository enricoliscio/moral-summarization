SUMMARY: While discussing reproductive rights, politicians often suggest that a world without abortion is desirable, claiming it as a moderate position to avoid being labeled extreme. However, this stance denies reality and stigmatizes abortion as a necessary evil rather than a medical procedure that saves women's lives, protects their autonomy, and addresses a range of circumstances. Doctors affirm that abortion is necessary for women's health and that barriers to contraception and reproductive coercion persist. They emphasize that each woman's situation is unique, and policies and talking points should focus on empowering women to make the best medical decisions for themselves. Framing abortion as a problem to be eradicated ignores its medical necessity and safety, echoing anti-abortion rhetoric that denies women basic healthcare and support. This article challenges the notion of "zero abortions" as a goal, arguing for a nuanced approach that respects women's health, autonomy, and complex personal views.
