SUMMARY:
Wendy Davis, a politician, recently stated that the goal should be to see "zero abortions." However, this stance is morally wrong and denies reality. Women will always need abortion care, and it's not a necessary evil, but a medical procedure that saves lives and protects autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, both medical professionals, argue that abortion is sometimes necessary to save a woman's life and that it's false to claim otherwise. They emphasize that women's circumstances are unique and that policies should focus on supporting their health and autonomy, rather than aiming for a false goal of zero abortions. This stance is not only morally right but also medically accurate. END OF SUMMARY.
