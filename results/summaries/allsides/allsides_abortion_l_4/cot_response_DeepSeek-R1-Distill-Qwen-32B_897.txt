Okay, so I need to help the user with this query. They provided a news article about Wendy Davis's comments on abortion and a specific task. The task has two parts: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Wendy Davis saying she wants zero abortions, which she thinks is a moderate stance. The author argues that this is unrealistic because abortion will always be necessary. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Wang to support the point that abortion is a necessary medical procedure, not something to eliminate. The article also touches on the societal stigma around abortion and the importance of supporting women's autonomy.

Now, for the first part, I need to find all single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry strong ethical or value-based connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "extreme," "deny," "sacrifices," "shaming," "coercion," "calamity," "unique," "thoughtful," "empathy," "autonomy," "equality," "empower," "support," "respect," "dignity," and "justice." These words are used to convey the moral stance against the idea of eliminating abortions.

Next, the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll start by stating Wendy Davis's position and the criticism it received. Then, mention the experts' arguments about abortion's necessity, the societal issues like access and coercion, and the call for policies that support women's health and autonomy. I should ensure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points.

I need to make sure the summary doesn't just list facts but reflects the moral arguments presented. Words like "extreme," "deny," "shaming," and "autonomy" should be included to maintain the original framing. I'll structure the summary to highlight the unrealistic nature of zero abortions, the medical necessity, and the need for supportive policies.

I think I've got all the necessary elements. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all the key moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
Wendy Davis recently stated that a "world without abortion" is a goal everyone should strive for, a stance she believes is moderate and avoids being labeled "extreme." However, this perspective denies reality, as abortion will always be necessary for women's health and autonomy. Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang argue that abortion saves lives and is a medical procedure, not a problem to be eradicated. The article highlights the importance of understanding the unique circumstances that lead women to seek abortions, such as coercion, financial instability, and contraceptive failure. Politicians who frame abortion as a "necessary evil" rather than a medical necessity perpetuate stigma and shaming. The focus should be on supporting women's health and autonomy, not reducing the number of abortions. Policies must reflect empathy and respect for women's decision-making, ensuring they have access to safe, affordable care. The idea of "zero abortions" is unrealistic and aligns with anti-abortion rhetoric, which undermines women's rights. END OF SUMMARY.
