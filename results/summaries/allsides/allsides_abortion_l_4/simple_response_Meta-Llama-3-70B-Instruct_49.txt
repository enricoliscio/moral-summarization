SUMMARY:

The article criticizes politicians, including Wendy Davis, for framing abortion as a necessary evil and suggesting that a world without abortion is a desirable goal. This stance is seen as a denial of reality, as women will always need abortion care. The article argues that abortion is a medical procedure that saves women's lives and protects their autonomy, and that it is not a social ill to be eradicated. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring women have access to healthcare and making informed decisions about their own bodies. The article quotes medical professionals, including Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang, who emphasize that abortion is a necessary part of reproductive healthcare and that there will always be a need for it. The article concludes that policymakers should focus on supporting women's health and autonomy, rather than trying to reduce the number of abortions.
