Alright, so the user has provided a news article about Wendy Davis's stance on abortion and the author's critique of it. They want me to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, okay, I need to make sure I capture the main points without losing the ethical perspective.

First, I should identify the key elements. The article talks about how politicians like Wendy Davis and Bill Clinton use the "zero abortions" rhetoric to appear moderate. But the author argues this is unrealistic and harmful because abortion is necessary for women's health and autonomy. They bring in experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang to support this point, emphasizing that abortion will always be needed due to various factors like contraception failure, life circumstances, and health risks.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. Let me outline the main points: Wendy Davis's statement, the critique that it's unrealistic, the necessity of abortion, the role of healthcare access, and the call for policy based on women's needs rather than reducing numbers.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Also, it's important to maintain the moral argument that abortion is a necessary medical procedure and that policies should focus on supporting women, not just reducing abortion rates.

Let me structure it: Start with Davis's statement, explain the critique, mention the experts' viewpoints, discuss why abortion is necessary, and conclude with the call for better policies. I'll need to use clear and concise language to fit everything in without exceeding the word limit.

I should also ensure that the summary reflects the author's stance that the "zero abortions" goal is harmful and that the focus should be on women's health and autonomy. Including the points about contraception's imperfection and the unique circumstances of each woman will strengthen the moral argument.

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it all together, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count after drafting to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY: Wendy Davis, during a campaign interview, stated that the goal should be to achieve "zero abortions," a stance she shares with other politicians to appear moderate. However, the author argues this position is unrealistic and harmful, as abortion is a necessary medical procedure for women's health and autonomy. Experts like Dr. Anne Davis and Dr. Lin-Fan Wang emphasize that abortion will always be needed due to factors like contraception failure, life circumstances, and health risks. The article criticizes the "zero abortions" rhetoric, which stigmatizes abortion and ignores the complexities of women's lives. It highlights that abortion is a safe, common medical procedure and that policies should focus on supporting women's health and decision-making, rather than reducing abortion rates. The author calls for nuanced conversations that recognize abortion as a necessary part of reproductive healthcare, not a problem to be eradicated. END OF SUMMARY.
