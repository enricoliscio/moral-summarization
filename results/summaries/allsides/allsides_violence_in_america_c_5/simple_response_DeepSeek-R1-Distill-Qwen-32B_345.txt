Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness towards the shooter, Dylann Roof. The author is reflecting on the moral implications of that forgiveness.

First, I should identify the main points. The author starts by acknowledging the impressive act of forgiveness by the victims' relatives, which is rooted in Christian love. This is seen as noble because it's a selfless act, sacrificing their own desire for vengeance. The author is moved by this but also feels some frustration. They question whether it's more admirable to forgive than to respond with anger.

Then, the author contrasts this Christian approach with a more nationalist, confrontational response, referencing Jewish nationalism and figures like Malcolm X. They suggest that African-Americans have this dual approach—forgiveness versus resistance. The author is critical of the idea that forgiveness is the only response, pointing out that it's surprising there isn't more outward violence given the historical injustices.

I need to capture both the admiration for the forgiveness and the critique that it might be too passive. Also, the comparison to Jewish nationalism and the Irgun is important to show the alternative approach.

I should structure the summary to first mention the forgiveness, its moral framing as noble, then the author's mixed feelings. Then introduce the alternative perspective of nationalism and the critique of why there isn't more resistance. Keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me try to draft that concisely.
