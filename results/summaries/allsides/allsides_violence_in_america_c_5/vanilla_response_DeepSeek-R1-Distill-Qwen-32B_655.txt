Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article discusses the reaction of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church members after the shooting in Charleston, where they forgave the shooter, Dylann Roof. The author is moved by their forgiveness but also feels frustration. He contrasts this with the idea of responding with anger, referencing Jewish nationalism and figures like Malcolm X. He questions why African-Americans don't respond with more violence, comparing their situation to that of Jews, who might have reacted differently. The author appreciates the Christian approach but also admires the protective nature of nationalism. The summary should capture this tension between forgiveness and the potential for a more confrontational response, highlighting the historical and cultural contexts involved.
