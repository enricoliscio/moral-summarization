Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article. The article is quite lengthy and discusses the reactions of African-American Christians to the Charleston church shooting, contrasting forgiveness with other forms of response like nationalism and violence. 

First, I need to understand the main points. The article starts by highlighting the forgiveness shown by the victims' relatives, which is seen as a noble Christian act. However, the author is conflicted, questioning if forgiveness is always the best response. They compare this to Jewish nationalism, like Zionism, which emphasizes self-defense. 

I should note that the article contrasts two approaches: the Christian forgiveness and the more confrontational nationalism seen in figures like Malcolm X. It also touches on the historical context of African-Americans using Christianity as a coping mechanism and their lower tendency towards violent responses compared to what might be expected.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the forgiveness and its Christian context, then introduce the author's conflict. Next, I'll explain the comparison with Jewish nationalism and the historical African-American approach. Finally, I'll highlight the contrast between forgiveness and potential violent responses, ending with the observation about the fortunate situation for white America.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without getting bogged down in details. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the emotional and moral implications of the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting, committed by white supremacist Dylann Roof. The author admires the Christian act of forgiveness but questions whether it is the only admirable response to such violence, contrasting it with the idea of righteous anger and self-defense. The piece reflects on the historical and cultural context of African-Americans, who have often embraced Christianity and non-violence, as seen in the Civil Rights Movement, while also acknowledging a less dominant strand of black nationalism and self-defense, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X. The author contrasts this with the Jewish response to oppression, particularly Zionism, which emphasizes self-protection. The article concludes by noting the remarkable choice of African-Americans to respond with forgiveness rather than violence, despite centuries of systemic oppression, and reflects on the moral complexities of such a choice. END OF SUMMARY.
