Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness towards Dylann Roof. The author is moved by their Christian forgiveness but feels some frustration. He contrasts this with Jewish responses, like Zionism, which emphasize self-defense. He also mentions historical African-American approaches, both Christian non-violence and more confrontational methods. The author questions why there isn't more outward violence and compares it to a hypothetical Jewish response.

I should capture the main points: forgiveness as noble but frustrating, the contrast between Christian love and self-defense, historical African-American approaches, and the author's reflection on why more violence isn't seen. Keep it under 200 words, concise, and include the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral implications of the victims of the Charleston church shooting forgiving the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, a white supremacist. The author admires the Christian expression of forgiveness as a noble act, akin to radical self-sacrifice, but feels frustration that such passivity is praised over responding with righteous anger. The author contrasts this with the Jewish emphasis on self-defense and nationalism, as seen in Zionism, and highlights the historical African-American approach of Christian non-violence versus confrontational methods like those of Malcolm X. The author questions why African-Americans, despite centuries of injustice, do not resort to more outward violence, comparing it to a hypothetical Jewish response. The piece ends by acknowledging the fortunate yet complex moral choices of African-Americans in consistently choosing less confrontational paths. END OF SUMMARY.
