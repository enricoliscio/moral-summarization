SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author feels frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for not seeking revenge. The author argues that it's also admirable to respond with righteous rage to injustice, citing the example of post-Holocaust Jews who vowed to never again become victims. The author notes that African-Americans have historically taken a more Christian approach to their suffering, but also acknowledges a lesser-known dimension of black nationalism and willingness to countenance political violence in self-defense. The author wonders why African-Americans don't respond with more violence towards white America, given the centuries of abuse they've suffered. The author concludes that white America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
