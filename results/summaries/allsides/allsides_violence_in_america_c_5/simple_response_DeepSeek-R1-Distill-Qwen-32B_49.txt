Alright, I need to summarize the given article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses the forgiveness shown by Charleston church members after the shooting, contrasting it with other responses to injustice. I should highlight the Christian forgiveness as noble but also the frustration it caused. The author compares this to Jewish nationalism and questions why African-Americans don't respond more aggressively. I need to balance these points, keeping it under 200 words. Let me structure it to first explain the forgiveness, then the frustration, followed by the comparison and the author's questioning. I'll ensure the moral aspects are clear, showing both admiration and criticism.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral and spiritual response of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church members in Charleston, who forgave the alleged white supremacist shooter, Dylann Roof, despite his lack of remorse. This act of Christian forgiveness is described as noble, drawing parallels to ultimate sacrificial love in Christianity. However, the author expresses frustration, questioning whether it is less admirable to respond with righteous anger instead of passivity. The piece contrasts this Christian approach with a more nationalist, confrontational response, as seen in Jewish history and figures like Malcolm X. The author marvels at the African-American community's consistent choice of non-confrontational responses to systemic injustice, suggesting that a more aggressive reaction might be expected given the historical and ongoing abuses. The article ultimately highlights the moral complexity of forgiveness versus resistance in the face of oppression. END OF SUMMARY.
