Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness towards the shooter, Dylann Roof. The author is reflecting on the moral implications of that forgiveness.

First, I should identify the key points. The victims, who are African-Americans, forgave Roof, a white supremacist. The author finds this act noble because it's a Christian expression of love over vengeance. But he's also frustrated because he thinks it's admirable to respond with anger instead. He compares this to Jewish nationalism, like Zionism, which is about protecting oneself.

The article also discusses the history of African-Americans using Christianity to deal with suffering, like during slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. However, there's another strand of African-American thought that advocates for self-defense and even violence, like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. The author is asking why there isn't more outward violence against white America, given the historical injustices.

I need to make sure I include as many of the morally framed words as possible: gunned, love, injustice, evil, nobility, act, dies, saving, noble, sacrifices, save, sacrifice, shooting, took, assault, violence, become, protect, fraught, wrenching, suffering, oppression, helping, hold, dehumanization, racism, secure, push, abuse, forgiveness, responded, fight, rioting, abuses, bondage, lynch, marinated, lacking, prey, incarceration, slaughter, terrorism, injustices.

So, the summary should cover the forgiveness act, its nobility, the author's mixed feelings, the comparison to Jewish nationalism, the historical context of African-Americans using Christianity, and the alternative of self-defense. It should end with the author's point about the fortunate situation of white America because of the victims' non-confrontational response.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step: start with the forgiveness, its moral significance, the author's conflicting emotions, the historical context, the alternative approaches, and the conclusion about the fortunate outcome.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, using the morally framed words as much as possible without making it sound forced. Make sure the flow is logical and covers all the key points succinctly.
