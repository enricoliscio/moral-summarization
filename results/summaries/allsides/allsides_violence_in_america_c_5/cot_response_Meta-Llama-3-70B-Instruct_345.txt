SUMMARY:
The relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims expressed forgiveness to the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, demonstrating the capacity of Christian love to overpower the natural urge for vengeance and retribution. This noble act of forgiveness was deeply moving, but also sparked frustration and irritation among some, who questioned whether it was more admirable to respond with righteous rage to the deadly assault. The article highlights the contrast between the Christian approach of non-violence and forgiveness, exemplified by Martin Luther King Jr., and the nationalist approach of responding to racial injustice with righteous anger and calls for self-defense, as seen in figures like Malcolm X. The author notes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have consistently chosen a less confrontational response. END OF SUMMARY.
