SUMMARY: The forgiveness shown by the relatives of those killed in the Charleston church shooting was a powerful display of Christian love and a testament to the strength of the victims. While admirable, it also raises questions about the notion of nobility and the tendency to equate sacrifice with nobility. The author reflects on the complexity of responding to injustice with forgiveness or righteous rage, drawing parallels between the African-American and Jewish experiences of oppression and the different approaches they have taken to protect themselves. The article explores the Christian approach of African-Americans, emphasizing non-violence and the display of suffering, as well as the less dominant nationalist and self-defensive approach within the black community. The author questions why, despite the immense injustices suffered by African-Americans, there hasn't been more nationalist or political violence directed outward. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered the gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational path, but also acknowledges the complexity and challenges of responding to such injustices with forgiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
