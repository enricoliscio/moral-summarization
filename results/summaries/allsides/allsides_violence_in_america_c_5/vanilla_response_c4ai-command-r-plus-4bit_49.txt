SUMMARY: The article reflects on the act of forgiveness demonstrated by the relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting, and how it showcased the power of Christian love and nobility. While the author acknowledges the nobility and strength of this response, they also express frustration and irritation at the notion that responding with passivity and acceptance is more commendable than expressing righteous rage. The article explores the different approaches African-Americans have taken throughout history to respond to their suffering and oppression, highlighting the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, as well as the nationalist and self-defense approach. The author questions why, given the history of injustices suffered by African-Americans, there hasn't been more outward violence directed towards white America. The article concludes by acknowledging the fortunate choice of non-violence by the victims of injustice, but also recognizing the complexity and difficulty of responding to such grave acts of racism and injustice.
