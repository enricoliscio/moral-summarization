SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the moral implications of the forgiveness expressed by the relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author also expresses frustration and irritation at the praise given to the victims for not seeking revenge. The author argues that it's equally admirable to respond with righteous rage to injustice, citing the example of post-Holocaust Jews who vowed to never again become victims. The article highlights the complex history of African-Americans, who have often responded to suffering and oppression with a Christian approach, emphasizing non-violence and forgiveness. However, it also notes a lesser-known dimension of black nationalism, which has advocated for self-defense and political violence in response to racial injustice. The author concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational response, but wonders why there isn't more outward-directed violence in response to centuries of abuse.
