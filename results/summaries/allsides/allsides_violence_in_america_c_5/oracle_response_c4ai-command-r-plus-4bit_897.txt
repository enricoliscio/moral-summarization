SUMMARY: The expression of forgiveness by the relatives of those gunned down in the Charleston church shooting has been lauded as a powerful display of Christian love and nobility. However, the author questions the notion that responding to an assault and injustice with passivity and forgiveness is more commendable than righteous rage and self-defense. The tendency to respond to racial violence with forgiveness is examined in the context of the African-American community's strong Christian faith and history of oppression. While Christianity has provided strength and dignity during times of suffering and racism, the author also explores a less dominant, more nationalist dimension within the black struggle, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, that advocates for fighting back against white supremacy. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have chosen non-violent responses, but also acknowledges the complexity of responding to such injustices with forgiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
