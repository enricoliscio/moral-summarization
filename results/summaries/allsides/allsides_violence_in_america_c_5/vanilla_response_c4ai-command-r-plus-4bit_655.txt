They admire the Christian love and nobility demonstrated by the families but also feel frustration and irritation. The author explores the tension between the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, and the nationalist approach of self-protection and righteous anger in response to injustice. They highlight the long history of racial injustice and abuse suffered by African-Americans and question why there hasn't been more outward violence directed at white America. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
