SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the forgiveness expressed by the relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author also feels frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for not seeking revenge. The author argues that responding with righteous rage to injustice is also admirable and that the African-American community's tendency to respond with Christian forgiveness may be rooted in their history of oppression and faith. The author contrasts this approach with the nationalist and more confrontational responses of some African-American leaders, such as Malcolm X, and wonders why there isn't more outward-directed violence from the community given the centuries of abuse they have suffered. The author concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
