SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author feels frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for not seeking revenge. The author argues that it's understandable to respond to injustice with righteous rage, citing the example of post-Holocaust Jews who vowed to never again become victims. The author notes that African-Americans have historically taken a more Christian approach to their suffering, but also acknowledges a less dominant, nationalist dimension to the black struggle, which emphasizes self-defense and political violence. The author wonders why, given the enormous abuses suffered by African-Americans, there isn't more violence directed against white America. The author concludes that white America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
