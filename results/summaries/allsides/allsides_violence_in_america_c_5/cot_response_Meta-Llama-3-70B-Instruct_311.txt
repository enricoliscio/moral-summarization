SUMMARY:
The relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting expressed forgiveness to the alleged white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof, showcasing the power of Christian love to overcome the natural urge for vengeance and retribution. While this act of forgiveness is noble and moving, it also sparks frustration and irritation, as it seems to prioritize passivity and acceptance over righteous rage and self-defense. The author contrasts this response with the Zionist approach, which emphasizes nationalism and self-protection. The article highlights the complex moral landscape of the African-American struggle, where Christian forgiveness coexists with nationalist and violent responses to racial injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
