SUMMARY: 
The author of this article reflects on the moral dilemma of forgiveness in the face of evil. When relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting forgave the perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof, it was a powerful demonstration of Christian love and an act of nobility, sacrificing their own good by offering unmerited forgiveness to someone who showed no remorse for his merciless act of evil. The author admires this expression of forgiveness but also feels frustrated and irritated. He questions whether it is truly more admirable to respond to a deadly assault with passivity and acceptance rather than righteous rage. He explores the complex moral landscape of responding to injustice, noting the long history of African-Americans choosing a Christian approach of non-violence and forgiveness in the face of oppression and racism. However, the author also highlights a less dominant, more nationalist and confrontational dimension within the black struggle, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, who advocated for self-defense and responded to abuse with anger and pride. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have often chosen a less confrontational path, but it also recognizes the complex moral questions that arise in the face of such horrific acts of violence and injustice.
