SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author also expresses frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for not seeking revenge. The author, a secular Jew turned Christian, admires the post-Holocaust Jewish insistence on self-protection and wonders why African-Americans, who have suffered greatly, don't respond with more nationalist and violent self-defense. The article highlights the Christian approach of non-violence and forgiveness in the African-American struggle, but also notes a less dominant, nationalist dimension that advocates for self-defense and political violence. The author concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
