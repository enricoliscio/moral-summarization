SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the remarkable display of Christian forgiveness by the relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting, where white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down innocent people. This act of nobility, inspired by the ultimate noble sacrifice of God's love for humanity, is undeniably moving. However, the author also expresses frustration and irritation at the praise for the victims' passivity, wondering if it's not more admirable to respond with righteous rage to such an act of merciless violence. The author contrasts this Christian approach with the nationalist and self-defense-oriented approach of some African-American leaders, who preached black pride and responded to racial injustices with anger and calls to fight back. The author questions why African-Americans, having suffered enormous abuses, don't respond with more violence against white America, and notes that white America is fortunate that they have chosen a less confrontational response.
