SUMMARY: Last week, relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting expressed forgiveness for the alleged perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof. This act of Christian forgiveness and love left many people, including the author, deeply moved and impressed. However, the author also feels a sense of frustration and irritation amidst this admiration. The author questions whether it is less admirable to respond with righteous rage and self-defense in the face of deadly violence and oppression. The author contrasts the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, often embraced by African-Americans, with a more nationalist and assertive approach to protecting one's community, as exemplified by Jewish Zionism and figures like Malcolm X. The author suggests that if Jews in America faced similar injustices and abuses as many African-Americans do, they might respond with anger and calls for political violence. The author concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have chosen a path of forgiveness and non-violence, but acknowledges the complexity and difficulty of such choices. END OF SUMMARY.
