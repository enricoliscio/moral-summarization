SUMMARY: The recent shooting in Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has brought to light the complex moral issues surrounding forgiveness, vengeance, and self-defense in the face of injustice. While the victims' relatives expressed forgiveness for the perpetrator, Dylann Roof, their response also highlights the tension between Christian ideals of love and forgiveness and the natural urge for righteous rage and self-protection. The article explores the historical context of African-American responses to oppression, including both non-violent Christian approaches and nationalist calls for political violence in self-defense. It questions why, despite the enormous abuses suffered by African-Americans, there hasn't been more outward violence directed towards white America. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have chosen a less confrontational response, while acknowledging the complexity of these moral choices.
