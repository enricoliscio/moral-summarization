SUMMARY: The recent mass shooting in Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has brought to light the complex emotions that arise in response to acts of racial injustice and violence. While the forgiveness expressed by the victims' relatives towards the perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof, was a powerful demonstration of Christian love and nobility, it also evoked mixed feelings in the author. The article explores the tension between the Christian ideal of forgiveness and the instinct for self-preservation, particularly within the African-American community. It highlights the historical struggle of African-Americans, who have often responded to oppression with Christian forgiveness and non-violent resistance, while also acknowledging the existence of a less dominant, more nationalist and confrontational approach. The author questions whether the response to racial injustice would be different if the victims were Jews, and expresses gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have chosen a less confrontational path. However, the article also acknowledges the frustration and irritation that can arise when victims refrain from lashing out at the source of their victimhood. The piece concludes by acknowledging the complexity of these moral dilemmas and the challenges faced by those who strive to respond to injustice with both strength and compassion.
END OF SUMMARY.
