SUMMARY:
The author discusses the moral complexity of the response to the Charleston church shooting, where relatives of the victims forgave the perpetrator. While acknowledging the nobility and Christian love behind this act, the author also questions the notion that responding with righteous rage is less admirable. They explore the tension between Christian forgiveness and the need for self-defense in the face of systemic racism and historical injustices against African-Americans. The article highlights the benefits of both approaches, including the power of non-violent civil rights movements and the potential for political violence as a form of self-defense. The author also considers the role of nationalism in protecting marginalized groups and the complex emotions evoked by expressions of forgiveness in response to heinous crimes. The text concludes by expressing gratitude that victims have chosen less confrontational responses, but it also recognizes the ongoing struggle against racial injustice and the need for collective strength and redemption.
