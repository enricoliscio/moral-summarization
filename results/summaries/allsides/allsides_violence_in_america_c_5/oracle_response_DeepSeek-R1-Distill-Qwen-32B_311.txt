Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author uses a lot of charged words like "gunned," "evil," "nobility," and "injustice." I should make sure to include as many of these as possible without making the summary too long.

The article starts with the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness of Dylann Roof. That's a key point about Christian love and forgiveness. I should highlight that and the moral concepts involved, like nobility and sacrifice.

The author contrasts this forgiveness with other responses, like anger and nationalism. Mentioning figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X shows the different approaches within the African-American community. I need to capture that tension between non-violence and more confrontational methods.

Also, the comparison to Jewish responses and the use of terms like "terrorism" and "injustices" adds depth. I should note how the author questions why there isn't more outward violence from African-Americans given the historical injustices.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the forgiveness, the moral concepts, the contrast with other responses, historical context, and the comparison to other groups. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone and message.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral implications of the Charleston church shooting victims' forgiveness of the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, a white supremacist. The author admires the Christian expression of love and forgiveness, which contrasts with the natural urge for vengeance. However, they also feel frustration, questioning whether it is less admirable to respond with righteous anger instead of passivity. The author draws parallels to Jewish nationalism, highlighting the importance of self-protection and resistance against oppression. African-Americans, historically, have often embraced a Christian approach to suffering, emphasizing non-violence and forgiveness, as seen in the Civil Rights Movement. However, the article also acknowledges a less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, who advocated for self-defense and resistance. The author contrasts this with the victims' forgiveness, wondering why African-Americans do not respond with more outward, nationalist violence, given centuries of injustice. The piece concludes by noting the moral complexity of forgiveness versus resistance, highlighting the moral framing of love, injustice, evil, nobility, and sacrifice. END OF SUMMARY.
