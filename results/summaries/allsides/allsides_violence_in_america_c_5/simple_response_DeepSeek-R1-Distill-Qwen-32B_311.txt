Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness of the shooter. The author contrasts this forgiveness with other responses, like anger and nationalism. I should highlight the moral dilemma between forgiveness and retribution, and mention the historical context of African-American responses to oppression. Also, the author compares this to Jewish nationalism, so I need to include that perspective. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. Let me structure it by first stating the forgiveness, then the author's admiration mixed with frustration, followed by the historical context, and end with the comparison to Jewish nationalism and the author's reflection on the moral implications.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral dilemma of forgiveness versus retribution in the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting, where victims forgave the white supremacist shooter, Dylann Roof. The author admires this act of Christian love but feels frustration, questioning whether responding with anger or resistance might be more justifiable. The piece contrasts the African-American tradition of Christian forgiveness, rooted in historical struggles, with the less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, who advocated for self-defense and resistance. The author also draws a parallel to Jewish nationalism, suggesting that if Jews faced similar systemic oppression, they might respond with more confrontational measures, as seen in groups like the Irgun. The piece ultimately highlights the moral complexity of forgiveness in the face of injustice and the profound sacrifice it entails, while acknowledging the legitimacy of alternative responses. END OF SUMMARY.
