SUMMARY: The relatives of those gunned down in the Charleston church shooting expressed forgiveness for the alleged perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof. This act of Christian love and forgiveness in the face of injustice and evil left many Americans, including the author, deeply moved and impressed. However, the author also feels a sense of frustration and irritation. They question whether it is less admirable to respond with righteous rage and self-defense in the face of deadly assault and oppression. The author compares the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, exemplified by Martin Luther King Jr., with a more nationalist and confrontational approach, such as Zionism, which seeks to protect a group against mortal enemies. They explore the history of African-Americans and their response to racism and injustice, noting the tendency to respond with forgiveness and the less dominant tradition of black nationalism and calls for political violence. The article concludes by expressing gratitude that victims of injustice have often chosen a less confrontational response, but acknowledges the complex moral questions that arise in these situations. END OF SUMMARY.
