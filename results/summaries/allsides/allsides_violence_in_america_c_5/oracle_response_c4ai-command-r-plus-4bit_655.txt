SUMMARY: The recent shooting in Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has brought to light the complex moral issues surrounding forgiveness, vengeance, and racial injustice. The victims' relatives expressed forgiveness for the perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof, showcasing the power of Christian love to overcome the natural urge for vengeance. While this act of forgiveness is noble, it also raises questions about the appropriateness of responding to an assault with passivity and acceptance. The author, a secular Jew who converted to Christianity, admires the insistence of post-Holocaust Jews to never again become victims and their commitment to Zionism as a form of nationalism to protect themselves. In contrast, African-Americans have often responded to their suffering and oppression with a more distinctively Christian approach, emphasizing non-violence and forgiveness. However, there is also a less dominant, less Christian dimension to the black struggle in America, characterized by nationalism and a willingness to fight back against white supremacy. The article explores the tension between these two approaches and acknowledges the extraordinary fortune of white America that the victims of its gravest injustices have often chosen a less confrontational response.
