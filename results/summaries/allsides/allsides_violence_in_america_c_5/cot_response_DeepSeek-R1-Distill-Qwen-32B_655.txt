Alright, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task involves two parts: first, identifying all single words with moral framing, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "forgiveness," "love," "vengeance," "retribution," "noble," "sacrifice," "evil," "gratuitous," "unmerited," "admirable," "passivity," "acceptance," "righteous," "rage," "self-destructive," "violence," "injustice," and "terrorism" stand out as they relate to moral judgments or values.

Moving on to the summary, I must condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral language intact. The article discusses the moral dilemma of forgiveness versus retribution in the context of the Charleston shooting. It contrasts Christian forgiveness with secular, nationalist responses, highlighting the moral complexity. I need to ensure the summary captures this contrast and the underlying moral arguments without losing the essence.

I should structure the summary to first mention the forgiveness expressed by the victims, then introduce the moral questions it raises. I'll contrast this with the secular, Zionist perspective and the historical context of African-American struggles. The conclusion should reflect the moral dilemma and the fortunate outcome of the less confrontational response.

I must be careful to include all the key moral terms identified earlier, ensuring the summary is concise yet comprehensive. Also, I need to maintain the flow and coherence, making sure each sentence logically follows the previous one.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all morally framed words are appropriately included. This should provide a clear, concise summary that preserves the original article's moral framing.

### SUMMARY:  
The article explores the moral complexity of forgiveness in the wake of the Charleston church shooting, where victims forgave the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. This act of Christian love and forgiveness was seen as noble, reflecting a radical sacrifice of one's own good. However, the author questions whether forgiveness is always the most admirable response, especially when the perpetrator shows no remorse. The article contrasts this with secular and nationalist approaches, such as Zionism, which prioritize self-defense and resistance. It highlights the historical and cultural context of African-Americans, who have often responded to racial injustice with Christian forgiveness, inspired by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. Yet, the article also acknowledges a less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, which advocates for righteous anger and self-defense. The author wonders why African-Americans, given their history of suffering, do not resort to more confrontational or violent responses, as might be expected in other cultures. The article concludes by reflecting on the moral dilemma of forgiveness versus retribution, emphasizing the fortunate yet complex choice of non-confrontation by African-Americans in the face of systemic injustice.  
END OF SUMMARY.
