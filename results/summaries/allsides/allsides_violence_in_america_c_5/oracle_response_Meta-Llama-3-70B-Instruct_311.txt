SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the expression of forgiveness by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author also feels frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for not responding with righteous rage. The author contrasts this Christian approach with a nationalist approach, citing the example of post-Holocaust Jews who vowed to never again become victims. The author notes that African-Americans have historically taken a more Christian approach to their suffering and oppression, but also acknowledges a less dominant, nationalist dimension to the black struggle in America, which has preached black pride and responded to racial injustice with righteous anger. The author questions why African-Americans have not responded with more violence towards white America, given the enormous abuses they have suffered, and wonders if Jews in a similar situation would respond with forgiveness or nationalist violence.
