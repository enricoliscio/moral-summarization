SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the stunning expression of forgiveness by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author expresses frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for refraining from righteous rage. The author argues that responding to an act of merciless violence with passivity and acceptance is not necessarily more commendable than responding with righteous anger. The author contrasts the Christian approach of African-Americans, who have historically responded to suffering and oppression with non-violence and forgiveness, with a nationalist approach that advocates for self-defense and political violence. The author wonders why African-Americans do not respond with more violence towards white America, given the enormous abuses they have suffered. The author concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have consistently chosen a less confrontational response.
