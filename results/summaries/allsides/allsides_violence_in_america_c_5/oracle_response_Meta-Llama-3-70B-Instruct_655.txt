SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author also expresses frustration and irritation at the expectation that victims of racial injustice should respond with passivity and acceptance. The author contrasts this with the Jewish experience, where the response to injustice is often one of righteous rage and a determination to protect oneself against mortal enemies. The author notes that African-Americans have historically taken a more Christian approach to their suffering, emphasizing non-violence and forgiveness, but also acknowledges a less dominant nationalist dimension that advocates for self-defense and political violence in response to racial injustice. The author wonders why, given the enormity of abuses suffered by African-Americans, there isn't more violence directed against white America. The author concludes that white America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
