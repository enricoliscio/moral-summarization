SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral complexity of forgiveness in the wake of the Charleston church shooting, where white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans. The victims' relatives expressed forgiveness, a powerful demonstration of Christian love and an act of noble sacrifice. However, the author questions the notion that responding with righteous rage is less admirable or more confrontational. They explore the tension between Christian forgiveness and the willingness to fight back in the face of oppression, highlighting the long history of racial injustice and abuse suffered by African-Americans. The article also touches on the role of nationalism and political violence in the black struggle for equality, and the tendency to view expressions of anger and self-defense as self-destructive. It concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have often chosen a less confrontational path, but acknowledges the complexity and moral ambiguity of such choices.
