SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the moral implications of forgiveness in the face of evil, specifically in the context of the Charleston church shooting. The author acknowledges the nobility of the victims' forgiveness, inspired by Christian love, but also expresses frustration and irritation at the expectation of passivity in the face of injustice. The author contrasts this response with the Zionist approach, which emphasizes self-protection and nationalism. The article highlights the complex history of African-American responses to oppression, from non-violent civil rights movements to nationalist and violent reactions. The author questions why there isn't more outward-directed violence from African-Americans, given the centuries of suffering, bondage, and lynch mobs. The article concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational response, but also acknowledges the nobility of alternative approaches that prioritize self-protection and justice.
