SUMMARY: The forgiveness expressed by the relatives of those killed in the Charleston church shooting was a powerful display of Christian love and a testament to the strength of the victims. However, the author questions the notion that responding with righteous rage and seeking justice is less admirable or commendable. The author explores the tension between the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, which has benefited the African-American community in its struggle for civil rights, and the nationalist approach of self-defense and political violence, embodied by figures like Malcolm X. The author suggests that the absence of a more widespread violent response to racial injustice in the African-American community is a fortunate outcome of their Christian faith. The author concludes with a reflection on how Jews in America, if subjected to similar injustices, might respond with a more confrontational approach.
