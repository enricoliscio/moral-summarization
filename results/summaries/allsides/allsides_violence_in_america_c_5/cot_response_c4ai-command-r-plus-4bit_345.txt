SUMMARY: The news article discusses the moral complexity of forgiveness in the wake of the Charleston church shooting. The author expresses admiration for the victims' families, who demonstrated Christian love and forgiveness towards the perpetrator, Dylann Roof. This act of forgiveness is seen as a noble sacrifice, overpowering the natural urge for vengeance and retribution. However, the author also feels frustration and irritation towards the expression of forgiveness and the praise it received from white Christians. The article explores the tension between responding to injustice with Christian forgiveness and the less dominant, less Christian response of righteous rage and political violence. It questions whether it is truly admirable to respond passively and acceptantly to deadly assaults and unmerited acts of evil. The article highlights the long history of African-Americans responding to suffering, oppression, and injustice with both Christian forgiveness and nationalist resistance. It concludes by expressing gratitude that those who have suffered grave injustices have often chosen a less confrontational response, but acknowledges the complexity of these moral choices.
