SUMMARY:
The relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting expressed forgiveness to the alleged white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof, showcasing the power of Christian love to overcome the natural urge for vengeance. While this act of forgiveness is noble and moving, it also raises questions about the morality of responding to acts of evil with passivity and acceptance. The author argues that it's understandable to respond with righteous rage to such injustices, citing the example of post-Holocaust Jews who vowed to never again become victims. The article highlights the complex history of African-Americans, who have often chosen a Christian approach to their suffering, but also have a nationalist dimension that advocates for self-defense and political violence. The author wonders why African-Americans don't respond with more violence against white America, given the centuries of abuse they have suffered. END OF SUMMARY.
