SUMMARY:

The article discusses the moral implications of forgiveness in the face of injustice, particularly in the context of the Charleston church shooting. The author acknowledges the nobility of the victims' forgiveness, inspired by Christian love, but also expresses frustration and irritation at the expectation that victims should respond with passivity and acceptance. The author contrasts this approach with the Zionist movement, which prioritizes self-protection and nationalism. The article highlights the complex history of African-American responses to oppression, including both Christian non-violence and nationalist calls for self-defense. The author questions why African-Americans have not responded with more violence against white America, given the centuries of abuse and injustice they have suffered. The article concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
