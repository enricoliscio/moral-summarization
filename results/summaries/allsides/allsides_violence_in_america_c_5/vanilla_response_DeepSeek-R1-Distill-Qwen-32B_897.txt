Okay, I need to summarize the given article. Let me read through it carefully. The article discusses the reaction of the Charleston church victims' relatives who forgave Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed them. It contrasts this forgiveness with other responses, like anger and self-defense, especially within the African-American community. The author, who is a converted Jew, admires the Christian forgiveness but also feels frustration, questioning if it's more noble than other responses. He mentions historical figures like MLK, Malcolm X, and others who promoted different approaches. The article ends by noting that African-Americans' choice of non-confrontational responses is a blessing for white America. 

So, the key points are: forgiveness in Charleston, comparison to Jewish responses, historical African-American approaches, and the author's mixed feelings. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting these elements.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the victims of the Charleston church shooting, committed by white supremacist Dylann Roof. While this act of Christian love was seen as noble, the author reflects on the moral complexity of forgiveness in the face of unprovoked evil. The piece contrasts this with the Jewish emphasis on self-defense and nationalism, as seen in Zionism, and highlights the historical African-American approach of non-violence, inspired by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. However, it also acknowledges a less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by Malcolm X and others, advocating for self-defense and resistance. The author questions why African-Americans, despite centuries of injustice, do not respond with more outward violence, drawing parallels to how Jews might react in similar circumstances. The article concludes that white America is fortunate that African-Americans have consistently chosen non-confrontational responses to injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
