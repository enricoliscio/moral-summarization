Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's perspective. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and placed between the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author discusses the forgiveness shown by the victims' relatives in the Charleston shooting, highlighting the Christian love aspect. They contrast this with a more confrontational approach, like nationalism or violence, as seen in Jewish history. The author questions why African-Americans don't respond with more outward violence, given their history of oppression.

Next, I need to identify key morally framed words from the article: gunned, love, injustice, evil, nobility, act, dies, saving, noble, sacrifices, save, sacrifice, shooting, took, assault, violence, become, protect, fraught, wrenching, suffering, oppression, helping, hold, dehumanization, racism, secure, push, abuse, forgiveness, responded, fight, rioting, abuses, bondage, lynch, marinated, lacking, prey, incarceration, slaughter, terrorism, injustices.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral nuances are captured. I'll start by mentioning the forgiveness in the context of the shooting, then discuss the noble act of sacrifice. Then, I'll contrast this with the potential for violence, referencing the comparison to Jewish nationalism. I'll conclude by highlighting the moral dilemma and the fortunate outcome for white America.

I need to keep the summary within 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the essential moral points. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral dilemma of forgiveness in the wake of the Charleston shooting, where victims' relatives forgave the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. This act of Christian love, seen as noble and sacrificial, contrasts with the natural urge for vengeance. The author admires this nobility but questions whether it is more admirable than responding with righteous anger. Drawing parallels to Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement, the author highlights the African-American community's historical embrace of non-violence, influenced by Christianity, versus a less dominant strand of black nationalism advocating for self-defense through violence. The author wonders why African-Americans, despite centuries of injustice, have not responded with more outward violence, comparing their situation to that of Jews and the Zionist paramilitary group, the Irgun. The piece concludes by acknowledging the moral complexity of forgiveness versus resistance, emphasizing the fortunate outcome for white America in the victims' peaceful response. END OF SUMMARY.
