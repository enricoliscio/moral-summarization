Okay, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' forgiveness of the shooter, Dylann Roof. The author is reflecting on the moral implications of that forgiveness.

The author mentions that the forgiveness was a stunning display of Christian love overcoming the desire for vengeance. That's a strong moral point. But then he's conflicted. He admires the nobility but feels frustration. He questions if it's more admirable to forgive than to react with anger. He draws a comparison with Jewish nationalism, like Zionism, which is about protecting the group, unlike the Christian approach which is more about forgiveness.

He also talks about African-American history, their use of non-violence led by MLK, and how that's a Christian approach. But he also mentions other leaders like Malcolm X who promoted a more confrontational stance. The author is asking why there isn't more outward violence from African-Americans given the injustices they've faced.

I need to make sure I include the morally charged words like gunned, love, injustice, evil, nobility, sacrifice, etc. The summary should capture the tension between forgiveness and the desire for justice or retribution, and the historical context of African-American responses to oppression.

I'll start by mentioning the forgiveness in the context of the shooting, highlight the moral concepts involved, then touch on the author's conflict and the historical background. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the listed terms as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me structure it: introduce the event and the moral framing, discuss the author's mixed feelings, compare with other approaches like nationalism, and conclude with the implications of the victims' choice. I'll make sure to weave in the key moral words throughout.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral implications of the victims of the Charleston church shooting expressing forgiveness for the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, a white supremacist. This act of Christian love, which overpowers the natural urge for vengeance, is seen as noble and spiritually significant. However, the author questions whether forgiveness is inherently more admirable than responding with righteous anger or self-defense. Drawing parallels to Jewish nationalism and Zionism, which emphasize self-protection, the author contrasts this with the African-American tradition of non-violence and Christian forgiveness, as exemplified by the Civil Rights Movement. The article highlights the historical suffering of African-Americans, from slavery to modern injustices, and asks why there isn't more outward, nationalist violence in response. The victims' choice of forgiveness, while inspiring, also raises moral questions about justice and self-defense in the face of systemic oppression. END OF SUMMARY.
