SUMMARY:
The relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims expressed forgiveness to the white supremacist perpetrator, Dylann Roof, showcasing the power of Christian love to overcome the natural urge for vengeance. While this act of forgiveness is noble and moving, it also sparks frustration and irritation. The author questions whether responding with righteous rage to a deadly assault is less admirable than responding with passivity and acceptance. The article highlights the distinct approaches of African-Americans to their suffering and oppression, with some embracing non-violence and Christian forgiveness, while others advocate for nationalism and political violence in self-defense. The author notes that white America is fortunate that the victims of its gravest injustices have consistently chosen a less confrontational response. END OF SUMMARY.
