Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses the forgiveness shown by Charleston church members after the shooting and contrasts it with other responses like nationalism and violence. I should highlight the Christian forgiveness as noble but also the frustration it caused. Mention the comparison with Jewish responses and the author's support for both approaches. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the moral and spiritual implications of the Charleston church members' forgiveness of Dylann Roof, the alleged perpetrator of the shooting. This act of Christian love, described as noble, contrasts with the natural human impulse for vengeance. The author admires the sacrifice but also feels frustration, questioning whether passive forgiveness is inherently more commendable than responding with righteous anger. The piece draws a parallel between African-American Christian forgiveness and Jewish nationalism, as exemplified by Zionism, which emphasizes self-defense and resistance. The author acknowledges the historical benefits of African-Americans' Christian approach, which has inspired movements like the Civil Rights Movement, but also highlights a less dominant strand of black nationalism, represented by figures like Malcolm X, advocating for self-defense. The article concludes by noting the moral complexity of these responses, recognizing the nobility of forgiveness while also respecting the validity of self-protective, nationalist approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
