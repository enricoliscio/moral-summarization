SUMMARY: The recent shooting in Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has brought to light the complex moral dynamics of forgiveness, vengeance, and self-preservation in the face of injustice. While the relatives of those gunned down chose to forgive the perpetrator, white supremacist Dylann Roof, their act of Christian love and nobility has sparked a debate about the most effective response to racial injustice and violence. The article explores the tension between the Christian approach of forgiveness and non-violence, exemplified by Martin Luther King Jr., and the nationalist approach of self-defense and political violence, advocated by figures like Malcolm X. It questions why, given the long history of abuses suffered by African-Americans, there isn't more nationalist violence directed outward against white America. The author acknowledges the power of Christian forgiveness and its role in the Civil Rights Movement, but also expresses frustration at the passive response to deadly assaults. The article concludes by acknowledging the good fortune of white America that the victims of its gravest injustices have chosen a less confrontational response. END OF SUMMARY.
