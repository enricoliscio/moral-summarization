Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should make sure to follow them carefully. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. They mentioned this as STEP 1, and each word should be listed with a *. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have strong moral connotations. Words like "forgiveness," "noble," "sacrifice," "evil," "righteous," "justice," "violence," "injustice," "good," "unjust," "oppression," "abuse," "suffering," "dignity," "freedom," "mercy," "forgiveness," "retribution," "passivity," "anger," "self-defense," "self-destructive," "abuses," "injustices," "violence," "confrontational," "good," "evil," "righteous," "violence," "passivity," "anger," "self-defense," "self-destructive," "abuses," "injustices," "violence," "confrontational," "good," "evil," "righteous," "violence," "passivity," "anger," "self-defense," "self-destructive," "abuses," "injustices," "violence," "confrontational."

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible, keeping it under 200 words. The summary should reflect the moral framing the author used. The article discusses the forgiveness shown by the Charleston church victims, contrasts it with other responses like anger and self-defense, and questions why more violent responses aren't seen. It also draws parallels with Jewish responses to oppression.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral concepts, like forgiveness, nobility, sacrifice, and the contrasting ideas of anger and self-defense. I'll mention the historical context of African-Americans and their Christian approach versus nationalist movements. Also, the comparison to Jewish responses and the fortunate situation of white America ending with the victims' less confrontational response.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. 

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the moral dilemma presented in the article, balancing the noble act of forgiveness with the understandable desire for retribution or self-defense. It should also touch on the historical and cultural contexts that influence these responses.

It contrasts this with the potential for righteous anger and self-defense, drawing parallels to Jewish responses to oppression. The piece questions why African-Americans, despite centuries of injustice, often choose forgiveness over confrontation, while acknowledging the historical and cultural roots of both Christian and nationalist approaches to suffering. It concludes by reflecting on the moral implications of these choices and the fortunate lack of widespread violent resistance in the face of systemic oppression. END OF SUMMARY.
