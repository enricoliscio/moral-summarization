The article discusses the reaction of forgiveness from the relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While the author acknowledges the nobility of this act, they also express frustration and irritation towards the praise of white Christians for the victims' passive response. The author argues that it's admirable to respond with righteous rage to injustice and that nationalism can be a powerful way for a group to protect itself. They highlight the dual approaches of the African-American community, with one embracing non-violence and Christianity, and the other advocating for nationalism and self-defense. The author wonders why there isn't more violence directed towards white America, given the centuries of abuse and injustice suffered by African-Americans.
