Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the article's main points. It's about the Charleston church shooting and the victims' families forgiving the shooter, Dylann Roof. The author is reflecting on the moral implications of that forgiveness.

First, I should identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral judgment or value. Let me go through the article again.

The article mentions "forgiveness," which is clearly a moral concept. Then "Christian love" and "vengeance" are discussed. "Refrain from lashing out" implies a moral choice. "Nobility" and "sacrifice" are moral terms. "Unmitigated evil" is a strong moral statement. "Gratuitous, unmerited love" is another moral concept. "Passivity" and "acceptance" are presented as moral choices. "Righteous rage" is a moral emotion. "Self-defense" and "political violence" are moral actions. "Self-destructive" is a moral judgment on behavior. "Injustices" and "abuses" are moral wrongs. "Nationalism" and "Zionism" are discussed in a moral context. "Less Christian dimension" refers to a different moral approach. "Violence" is a moral issue. "Less confrontational response" is a moral choice.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. The article contrasts the forgiveness shown by the victims with the potential for anger and resistance. It highlights the moral nobility of forgiveness but also questions why there isn't more resistance. The author compares this to other groups, like Jews, who might respond differently. The summary should capture this tension and the moral implications without losing the essence.

I'll start by mentioning the forgiveness and its moral significance. Then, introduce the author's mixed feelings about the nobility of forgiveness versus the合理性 of anger. Mention the historical context of African-Americans using Christian forgiveness versus nationalist approaches. Conclude with the author's reflection on why there isn't more resistance and the moral implications of the chosen response.

**Summary:**
The article discusses the moral implications of the victims' forgiveness of Dylann Roof, the Charleston church shooter, highlighting the nobility of Christian love and sacrifice. The author admires this forgiveness but questions why there isn't more righteous anger or resistance, especially given the historical injustices faced by African-Americans. The piece contrasts this Christian approach with nationalist movements advocating for self-defense, like those led by figures such as Malcolm X. It also reflects on the rarity of outward-directed violence from African-Americans, despite systemic oppression, and contrasts this with the potential response of a Jewish community facing similar circumstances. The author acknowledges the moral strength of forgiveness but also expresses frustration that more confrontational responses aren't seen, given the enduring injustices. END OF SUMMARY.
