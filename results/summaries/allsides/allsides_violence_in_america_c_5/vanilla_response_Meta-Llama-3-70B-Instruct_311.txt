SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author expresses frustration and irritation at the praise given to the victims for refraining from anger and instead choosing forgiveness. The author, a secular Jew turned Christian, admires the unwavering insistence of post-Holocaust Jews to protect themselves against mortal enemies. In contrast, African-Americans have historically taken a more Christian approach to their suffering, with many responding to racist acts with forgiveness. However, the author notes that there is also a less dominant, nationalist dimension to the black struggle in America, which emphasizes self-defense and righteous anger. The article concludes that White America is fortunate that African-Americans have chosen a less confrontational response to their injustices.
