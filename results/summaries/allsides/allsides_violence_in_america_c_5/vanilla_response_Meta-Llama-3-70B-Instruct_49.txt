SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the forgiveness expressed by relatives of the Charleston church shooting victims towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof. While acknowledging the nobility of this act, the author expresses frustration and irritation towards those who praise the victims for refraining from anger and instead offering forgiveness. The author, a secular Jew turned Christian, admires the Zionist approach of protecting oneself against mortal enemies and wonders why African-Americans, who have suffered greatly, do not respond with more nationalist and violent self-defense. The article highlights the dominant Christian approach of non-violence in the African-American struggle, but also notes a less dominant dimension of nationalism and willingness to countenance political violence. The author concludes that White America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response.
