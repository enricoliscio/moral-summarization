SUMMARY: The forgiveness expressed by the relatives of those killed in the Charleston church shooting was a powerful display of Christian love and a testament to the strength of the victims. While admirable, it also raises questions about the complexity of moral responses to injustice. The author explores the tension between the Christian value of forgiveness and the instinct for self-preservation, particularly within the African-American community. They admire the unwavering refusal of Jews to become victims again after the Holocaust and the embrace of Zionism as a form of nationalism that protects them from enemies. In contrast, African-Americans have often responded to oppression with Christian forgiveness, as seen in the Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. However, there is also a history of black nationalism and calls for political violence in self-defense within the black community. The author wonders why, given the long history of injustices suffered by African-Americans, there hasn't been more outward violence directed against white America. They suggest that the Christian approach to suffering and oppression has benefited the African-American community, but also questions if it may be preventing them from taking a more confrontational stance against racial injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
