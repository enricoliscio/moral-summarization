Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about the relatives of the victims in the Charleston church shooting expressing forgiveness towards Dylann Roof, the alleged perpetrator. The author is moved by this display of Christian love but also feels some frustration. He questions whether it's more admirable to forgive than to react with anger. 

He compares this to his Jewish background, where the emphasis is on not becoming victims again, which ties into his support for Zionism as a form of nationalism for self-protection. 

The article then discusses the history of African-Americans using a Christian approach to suffering, which has been beneficial in movements like Civil Rights led by MLK. However, there's also a less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, advocating for self-defense through violence if necessary.

The author contrasts the forgiveness shown by African-Americans with how Jews, especially after the Holocaust, might respond differently, perhaps with more confrontational methods. He suggests that white America is lucky that African-Americans have chosen a less confrontational path.

So, the summary needs to capture the tension between forgiveness and the potential for a more confrontational response, the historical context of African-American struggles, and the comparison to Jewish nationalism. It should also mention the author's mixed feelings about the forgiveness shown.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it: start with the forgiveness in Charleston, the author's mixed feelings, the historical context of African-Americans using Christian forgiveness versus nationalism, the comparison to Jewish responses, and the conclusion about white America's fortune.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, covering all main points without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the aftermath of the Charleston church shooting, where victims' relatives forgave the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, a white supremacist. The author admires this display of Christian forgiveness but feels conflicted, questioning whether it's more admirable than responding with anger. Drawing from his Jewish background, he contrasts this with the Jewish emphasis on self-protection and nationalism, as seen in Zionism. The article highlights African-Americans' historical use of Christian forgiveness in facing oppression, as exemplified by the Civil Rights Movement, while also noting a less dominant strand of black nationalism advocating for self-defense through violence. The author wonders if Jews in a similar situation would respond with forgiveness or more confrontational methods, like the Irgun. He concludes that white America is fortunate that African-Americans have largely chosen a less confrontational path. END OF SUMMARY.
