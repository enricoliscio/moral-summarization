Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article discusses the forgiveness shown by the victims of the Charleston church shooting towards Dylann Roof, the white supremacist. It contrasts this Christian forgiveness with other approaches, like nationalism and political violence, especially in the context of African-American history.

The author, who is a converted Christian but raised secular Jewish, admires the forgiveness but also feels frustration. He compares this to Jewish responses, particularly after the Holocaust, where there's a strong emphasis on self-protection and nationalism, as seen in Zionism.

He mentions historical figures in the African-American community who advocated for more confrontational methods, like Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey, versus the non-violent approach of Martin Luther King Jr. The article questions why African-Americans haven't responded with more outward violence, given the systemic injustices they've faced, and compares this to how Jews might respond in a similar situation.

In the end, the author reflects on the choice of non-confrontational responses by African-Americans, which he sees as a source of both admiration and frustration. He acknowledges the benefits of their Christian approach but also points out the potential for different reactions.

So, the summary should cover the main points: the forgiveness in Charleston, the contrast with other responses, the historical context, and the author's mixed feelings about the choice of non-violence versus nationalism.

SUMMARY: The article explores the forgiveness expressed by the victims of the Charleston church shooting towards the alleged perpetrator, Dylann Roof, highlighting the Christian principle of love and sacrifice. The author admires this act of nobility but feels frustration, questioning whether responding with anger or political violence might also be admirable. Comparing this to Jewish responses to oppression, particularly through Zionism, the author notes the African-American community's historical embrace of non-violence, as seen in the Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. However, he also acknowledges a less dominant strand of black nationalism, exemplified by figures like Malcolm X, advocating for self-defense and resistance. The article reflects on why African-Americans have not responded with more outward violence, given systemic injustices, and contrasts this with a hypothetical Jewish response. The author concludes with admiration for their peaceful approach but also acknowledges the potential for different reactions. END OF SUMMARY.
