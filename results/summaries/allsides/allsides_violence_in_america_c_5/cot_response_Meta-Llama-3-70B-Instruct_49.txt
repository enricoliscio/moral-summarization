SUMMARY:
The article discusses the moral implications of forgiveness in the face of racial injustice, specifically in the context of the Charleston church shooting. The author is moved by the victims' expression of Christian forgiveness towards the white supremacist perpetrator, but also feels frustration and irritation towards those who praise this response as noble. The author argues that it's understandable to respond with righteous rage to acts of violence and oppression, and questions why African-Americans have historically chosen a more Christian approach of non-violence and forgiveness. The article highlights the importance of nationalism and self-defense in the face of systemic injustice, and wonders why there isn't more violence directed towards white America. The author concludes that white America is fortunate that the victims of its injustices have chosen a less confrontational response. END OF SUMMARY.
