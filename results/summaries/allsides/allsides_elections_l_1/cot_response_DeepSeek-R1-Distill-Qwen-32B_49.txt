Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article with a focus on moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Trump's Tulsa rally and his campaign strategy. First, I need to understand their exact requirements. They want two things: a list of morally framed words and a summary preserving those moral terms.

The user specified that in the first step, I should identify all single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation. I'll need to go through the article and pick out each word that fits this criterion. For example, words like "enemies," "strife," "joking," "sinister," etc. I should list each of these with an asterisk and on new lines.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of these moral words as possible. I'll have to condense the article, highlighting Trump's tactics and the moral implications. I should focus on his strategies, the use of divisive rhetoric, and the encouragement of violence, all while keeping the summary clear and within the word limit.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content. It's important to maintain the moral framing to show the negative aspects of Trump's campaign approach. I'll start by outlining the main points: the rally's purpose, the enemies he targeted, his dismissive attitude towards the virus, the insults, and the encouragement of violence. Then, I'll weave in the morally charged words to emphasize the tone and intent.

I should double-check that each step is clearly marked and that the summary doesn't exceed the word limit. It's crucial to preserve the essence of the article while adhering to the user's instructions. I'll make sure the summary is coherent and effectively communicates the moral framing as intended.

**SUMMARY:**  
At his Tulsa rally, President Trump reframed his reelection campaign around enmity, targeting anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He dismissed the 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, joking about testing and trivializing the virus. Trump mocked critics, labeling them "sadistic" and "sinister," and encouraged the crowd to boo reporters, calling them "dishonest." He accused Democrats of tearing down statues and linked them to violence, while attacking Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she wanted to impose Somali governance on the U.S. Trump also equated undocumented immigrants with "animals" and praised ICE agents for using force. He incited violence against protesters, encouraging followers to arm themselves and even suggested deploying troops to quell unrest. Trump's campaign, as seen in Tulsa, centers on lies, hatred, and the subversion of democracy, with a clear intent to deepen division and chaos in America.
