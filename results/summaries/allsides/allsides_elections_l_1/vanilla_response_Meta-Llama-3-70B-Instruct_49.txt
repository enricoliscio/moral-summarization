SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that focused on enemies and strife rather than his accomplishments. He downplayed the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joking about testing and recovery times. Trump spent most of his speech attacking various groups, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and "illegal aliens." He used ethnic slurs, insulted government employees, and threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump also pitted black Americans against Latin Americans and speculated about the nationality of protesters. He encouraged violence, calling immigrants with criminal records "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. Trump suggested sending troops to put down domestic unrest and even encouraged the governor of Washington to attack protesters. Overall, Trump's speech was filled with hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government.
