SUMMARY:

President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than outlining his accomplishments or vision for the country. He targeted various groups, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and immigrants, using divisive language and insults. He downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, joked about testing, and showed a callous disregard for the 120,000 Americans who have died from the virus. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, challenging the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitting different racial groups against each other. He also appealed to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. The speech was a stark display of Trump's willingness to accelerate the destruction of America, and his intent to run on a platform of lies, hatred, and demagoguery.

END OF SUMMARY.
