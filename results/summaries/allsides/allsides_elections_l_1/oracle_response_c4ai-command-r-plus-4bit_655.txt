SUMMARY: On Saturday night in Tulsa, President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign, focusing on stoking enmity and strife rather than highlighting his accomplishments. He shrugged off the threat of the coronavirus, joking about the number of infections and downplaying the risk to children. Trump insulted and ridiculed various individuals and groups, including journalists, athletes who knelt during the national anthem, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He used ethnic slurs and challenged the loyalty of a naturalized American, Representative Ilhan Omar. The president appealed to violence and praised ICE agents who used force against immigrants with criminal records. He encouraged his followers to arm themselves against protesters and suggested sending troops to put down domestic unrest. Trump's rhetoric was filled with hatred, demagoguery, and a willingness to accelerate the destruction of America for his own political gain. He offered a vision of a second term marked by more lies, division, and subversion of constitutional government.
END OF SUMMARY.
