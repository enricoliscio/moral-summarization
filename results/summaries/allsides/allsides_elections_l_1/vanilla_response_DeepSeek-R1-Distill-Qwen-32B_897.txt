Alright, I need to summarize this article about President Trump's Tulsa rally. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying Trump tried to relaunch his reelection campaign after three months without rallies due to COVID-19. The main points seem to be his focus on enemies and division rather than his accomplishments.

He talks about defeating anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. Instead of prosperity, he's running on strife. He downplayed the virus deaths, joked about testing, and made light of the risks, like shaking hands with kids.

Critics say he's not hiding his intent to divide. He insults various groups, like calling the virus "Kung Flu" and DACA recipients. He also attacks politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, suggesting they're disloyal.

He encourages violence against protesters, calling them "thugs" and supporting the use of force. He even suggested sending troops to quell unrest, showing excitement about it.

Overall, the article paints Trump as promoting division, hatred, and potential violence in his campaign. His focus is on attacking enemies rather than his policies.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, highlighting his divisive rhetoric, attacks on various groups, encouragement of violence, and the overall negative campaign strategy.
