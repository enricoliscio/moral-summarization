SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a divisive speech that promoted strife and hatred. He shrugged off the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joking about testing fewer people to find fewer infections. Trump devoted his speech to skewering his enemies, calling them "sadistic," "vicious," and "hateful." He ridiculed journalists, athletes who kneel for the national anthem, and Democrats, claiming they are "radical" and "sinister." Trump also directed ethnic attacks at foreigners, naturalized Americans, and specific ethnic groups, using slurs and insinuations. He encouraged violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and suggesting that Americans take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech was a stark reminder of the hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government that he would bring in a second term. END OF SUMMARY.
