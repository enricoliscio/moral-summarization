SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, joking that fewer tests would mean fewer infections. He insulted and threatened various groups, including Democrats, journalists, and athletes who kneel for the national anthem. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, slurs, and insinuations, challenging the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitting black Americans against Latin Americans. He railed against undocumented immigrants, vowed to abolish DACA, and compared murders in Baltimore and Detroit to those in Guatemala and El Salvador. Trump's rhetoric went beyond hatred, appealing explicitly to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. He encouraged his followers to take matters into their own hands, saying it's "damn nice" to have firearms when seeing protesters on the streets. Trump's speech was a stark display of demagoguery, subversion of constitutional government, and encouragement of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
