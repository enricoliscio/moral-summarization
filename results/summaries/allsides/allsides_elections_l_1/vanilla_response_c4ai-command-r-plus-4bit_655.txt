SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump held a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, marking his return to the campaign trail after a three-month hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump's speech focused on stoking division and fear, attacking various groups and individuals, and promoting violence and ethnic attacks. He dismissed the threat of the coronavirus, mocked efforts to control its spread, and downplayed the death toll. Trump also targeted journalists, athletes, Democrats, and government officials, using insults and slurs to demean them. The president appealed to xenophobic sentiments, pitting different ethnic groups against each other and challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American citizen, Representative Ilhan Omar. He praised violence and encouraged his supporters to take up arms against protesters. Trump threatened to send troops to Seattle to put down domestic unrest and expressed excitement at the prospect of using force. The rally highlighted Trump's strategy of running on a platform of strife and destruction, rather than his accomplishments or policy proposals.
