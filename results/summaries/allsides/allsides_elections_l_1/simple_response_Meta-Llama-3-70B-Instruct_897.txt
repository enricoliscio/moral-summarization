SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than presenting a vision for the country's future. He blamed various groups, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and immigrants, for the country's problems, and used derogatory language to describe them. He joked about the 120,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus, showed disdain for the lives lost, and encouraged violence against protesters and immigrants. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, insults, and threats, including challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American and pitting black Americans against Latin Americans. He appealed explicitly to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. This is what Trump offers in a second term: more lies, hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, with the potential for more violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
