SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In his speech, he shrugged off the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, joking about the number of Americans killed and downplaying the risks to children. Instead of highlighting his accomplishments, Trump focused on attacking his enemies, including journalists, athletes who kneel during the national anthem, and Democratic politicians. He insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser with financial repercussions. Trump also used ethnic slurs and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar. He pitted different racial and ethnic groups against each other and insinuated that undocumented immigrants were responsible for crime and violence. Trump praised violence and encouraged his supporters to take up arms against protesters, even offering to send troops to Seattle to put down domestic unrest. Trump's campaign rally revealed his intention to run on a platform of hatred, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional government, appealing to violence and the destruction of America.
END OF SUMMARY.
