SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Instead of focusing on his accomplishments, Trump's speech was filled with insults, threats, and slurs directed at various groups, including journalists, athletes, Democrats, undocumented immigrants, and ethnic minorities. He shrugged off the deaths of 120,000 Americans from the coronavirus, joking about the number of tests conducted. Trump's rhetoric pitted different racial groups against each other and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans. He praised violence and encouraged his followers to take up arms against protesters, even offering to send troops to quash domestic unrest. Trump's campaign rally was a display of demagoguery, hatred, and a blatant appeal to strife and division. He is running on a platform that threatens the destruction of America's constitutional government.
END OF SUMMARY.
