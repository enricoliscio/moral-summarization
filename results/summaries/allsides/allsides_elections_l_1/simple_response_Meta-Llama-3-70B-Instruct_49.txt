SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a divisive and hateful speech. Instead of focusing on his accomplishments, Trump devoted his speech to attacking his perceived enemies, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and immigrants. He made light of the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joked about shaking hands with children, and claimed that people would recover from the virus in 15 minutes. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, insults, and threats, including challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American and appealing to violence. He described immigrants as "animals" and praised ICE agents for using force against them. Trump also encouraged his followers to take matters into their own hands, saying it was "damn nice" to have firearms to deal with protesters. His speech was a stark display of hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, offering a bleak vision for a second term.

END OF SUMMARY.
