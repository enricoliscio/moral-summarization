Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about a Trump rally and wants a summary that includes the morally charged words. 

First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "enemies," "strife," "joking," "sinister," "dishonest," "hatred," "radical," "corrupt," "violence," "subversion," "destruction," and "chaos." These words are crucial because they set the tone and the moral stance of the article.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the article's critical perspective on Trump's campaign tactics. I should highlight how Trump is focusing on division and conflict rather than achievements, using derogatory language and promoting violence.

I should structure the summary to first mention the rally and the focus on enemies and conflict. Then, detail the specific instances of moral framing, like the jokes about the virus, the attacks on various groups, and the encouragement of violence. Finally, conclude with the overall impact on the campaign and the nation.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key morally framed words without making it sound disjointed. It's important to maintain the critical tone of the original article while keeping the summary clear and within the word limit.

I think I've got a good structure. I'll start with the rally, mention the enemies, include the specific moral words, describe the attacks on different groups, and end with the implications of Trump's approach. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
At a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign, focusing on dividing the nation by targeting enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. Instead of discussing achievements, Trump mocked the virus death toll, trivialized its impact, and attacked opponents, calling them "sinister" and "dishonest." He encouraged violence, labeling immigrants and protesters as "animals" and "thugs," while praising those who would use force against them. Trump also insinuated that a Biden administration would be controlled by figures like Rep. Ilhan Omar, a naturalized American. His rhetoric promoted division, hatred, and potential violence, offering a vision of a second term defined by conflict and chaos rather than unity or progress. END OF SUMMARY.
