SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by promoting a message of strife and hatred. He blamed "enemies" such as anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and "millions and millions of illegal aliens" for the country's problems. Trump's speech was filled with morally charged language, labeling his opponents as "sadistic," "vicious," "hateful," and "sinister." He ridiculed and threatened individuals, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump also made ethnic attacks, using slurs and insinuations against several groups, and pitted black Americans against Latin Americans. He encouraged violence, calling undocumented immigrants "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. Trump's message is clear: he's running on a platform of hatred, demagoguery, and destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
