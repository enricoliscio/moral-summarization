Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points. The article describes Trump's Tulsa rally, where he focused on enmity and division rather than his achievements. He criticized various groups, used derogatory terms, and encouraged violence. 

I should identify key events: Trump's dismissal of COVID-19 deaths, his derogatory language towards journalists, athletes, and immigrants, and his encouragement of violence against protesters. I need to use as many of the provided moral words as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to highlight his negative actions and the moral implications, ensuring each point is concise. I'll make sure to include words like "shrugged," "joking," "insulted," "threatened," and others from the list. The summary should convey the destructive and divisive nature of Trump's campaign as portrayed in the article.
