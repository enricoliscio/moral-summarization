SUMMARY: At his reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, President Trump shrugged off the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, joking about the number of Americans killed and minimizing the risk to children. He insulted and threatened his political opponents, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump also used ethnic slurs and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar. He pitted different racial groups against each other and railed against undocumented immigrants, vowing to abolish DACA. Trump appealed to hatred and violence, praising ICE agents who use force and encouraging his followers to arm themselves against protesters. Trump's speech was filled with lies, demagoguery, and encouragement of constitutional subversion. He suggested that he would enjoy sending troops to put down domestic unrest and even hinted at using violence himself. Trump is running for reelection on a platform of strife, enmity, and the destruction of America.
END OF SUMMARY.
