SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than outlining his accomplishments. He shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, joking that testing fewer people would result in fewer reported infections. Trump insulted and threatened various individuals, including a government employee, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. He directed ethnic attacks at foreigners and naturalized Americans, using slurs and insinuations to challenge their loyalty. Trump also pitted black Americans against Latin Americans and compared murders in Baltimore and Detroit to those in Guatemala and El Salvador. Beyond hatred, Trump appealed explicitly to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. He encouraged his followers to take matters into their own hands, saying it's "damn nice" to have firearms when faced with protesters. Trump's speech was a call to more lies, demagoguery, subversion of constitutional government, and perhaps even violence. END OF SUMMARY.
