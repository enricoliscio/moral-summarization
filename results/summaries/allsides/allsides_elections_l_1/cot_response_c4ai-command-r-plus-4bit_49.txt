SUMMARY: President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Instead of focusing on his accomplishments or a vision for a second term, Trump's speech was rife with enmity and hatred. He shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus pandemic, joking about it and scoffing at those who blamed him. Trump ran on a platform of strife, denouncing journalists, athletes, anarchists, and Democrats. He insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatened DC Mayor Muriel Bowser with financial repercussions. Trump directed slurs and attacked several ethnic groups, calling the coronavirus "Kung Flu," pitting Black Americans against Latin Americans, and challenging the loyalty of naturalized citizens like Rep. Ilhan Omar. The president encouraged violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and expressing enjoyment at the idea of sending troops to quell domestic unrest. Trump's reelection bid is centered on accelerating the destruction of America through lies, hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government.
END OF SUMMARY.
