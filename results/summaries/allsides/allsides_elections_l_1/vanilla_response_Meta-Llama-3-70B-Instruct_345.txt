SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that focused on attacking his enemies rather than promoting his accomplishments. He targeted anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and illegal immigrants, using divisive rhetoric to stir up strife. Trump downplayed the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joking about testing and handshaking with children. He insulted government employees, athletes who kneel during the national anthem, and politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump also made ethnic attacks, using slurs and insinuations against various groups, and challenged the loyalty of a naturalized American. He even appealed to violence, praising ICE agents and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech offered a vision of a second term marked by lies, hatred, and demagoguery.
