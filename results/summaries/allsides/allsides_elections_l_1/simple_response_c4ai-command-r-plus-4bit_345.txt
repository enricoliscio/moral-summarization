SUMMARY: On Saturday night, President Trump held a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he focused on stoking division and fear among the American people rather than highlighting his accomplishments or presenting a positive vision for the future. He downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, ridiculed government officials, journalists, athletes, and political opponents, and used racist and xenophobic language to describe immigrants and people of color. Trump also encouraged violence and praised those who use force to maintain control. He threatened to send troops to put down domestic unrest and even insinuated that he would enjoy doing so. Trump's campaign rally showcased his willingness to exploit division, fear, and hatred to gain political power, and his disregard for the well-being and unity of the American people.

END OF SUMMARY.
