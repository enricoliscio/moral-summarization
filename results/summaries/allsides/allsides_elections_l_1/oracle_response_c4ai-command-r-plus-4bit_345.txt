SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and delivered a speech rife with moral framing. He shrugged off the coronavirus pandemic, joking about the number of deaths and downplaying the risks to children. Trump insulted and threatened his opponents, from politicians to journalists and athletes, and ripped into undocumented immigrants and anarchists. He challenged the loyalty of a naturalized American, using ethnic slurs and insinuations to paint a dire picture of a Biden presidency. Trump pitted different racial groups against each other and compared murder rates in US cities to those in Central America. He appealed to violence, praising ICE agents who use force and urging followers to arm themselves against protesters. Trump suggested sending troops to put down domestic unrest, even offering to help himself. His speech was filled with hatred, demagoguery, and lies, and he made no attempt to hide his intent to accelerate the destruction of America in a second term.
END OF SUMMARY.
