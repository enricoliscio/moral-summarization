SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump held a reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focusing on stoking division and enmity rather than his accomplishments or policy plans. He downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, mocked those who criticized his response, and shrugged off the high death toll. Trump's speech was filled with insults and attacks directed at various groups, including journalists, athletes, Democrats, immigrants, and Representative Ilhan Omar. He used racist and xenophobic language, pitting different ethnic groups against each other and challenging the loyalty of a naturalized citizen. Trump encouraged violence against immigrants and protesters, praised armed citizens, and suggested he would enjoy deploying troops to quell unrest. He also threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser with financial repercussions. The rally highlighted Trump's intention to continue and intensify the divisive and destructive rhetoric and actions of his first term if reelected. 

END OF SUMMARY.
