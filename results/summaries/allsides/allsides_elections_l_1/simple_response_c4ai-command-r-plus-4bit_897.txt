SUMMARY: Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focusing on stoking division and enmity rather than highlighting his accomplishments or a positive vision for the future. He downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, mocked efforts to test and contain it, and dismissed the loss of lives. Trump's speech was filled with insults, ethnic slurs, and attacks on various groups, including journalists, athletes, Democrats, immigrants, and Representative Ilhan Omar. He encouraged violence against protesters and praised ICE agents for using force. Trump's rhetoric promoted xenophobia, pitted different racial groups against each other, and questioned the loyalty of naturalized Americans. The president seemed excited by the prospect of using military force to quell domestic unrest and even suggested letting the people of Seattle suffer as a warning to others. Trump's campaign strategy is centered on creating and exploiting division, hatred, and violence, offering no positive agenda for his second term. 

END OF SUMMARY.
