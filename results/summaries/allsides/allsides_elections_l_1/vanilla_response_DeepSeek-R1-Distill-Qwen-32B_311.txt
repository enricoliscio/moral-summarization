Okay, so I need to summarize this article about President Trump's Tulsa rally. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should be in a specific format starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump is trying to restart his campaign after the pandemic. He's focusing on enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and illegal aliens instead of his achievements. He made jokes about the virus, downplayed its impact, and criticized critics. He used derogatory terms for various groups, including immigrants, Somalis, and even a congresswoman. He also encouraged violence against protesters and praised using force.

I need to condense this into a summary that captures Trump's strategy, his rhetoric, and the implications. I'll mention the focus on division, the attacks on different groups, and the encouragement of violence. I should keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me structure it: start with the event, Trump's approach, his rhetoric against various groups, his downplaying of the virus, and the promotion of violence. Make sure it flows well and covers all key points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
At a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, President Trump sought to restart his reelection campaign by focusing on division and conflict rather than his achievements. He blamed journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants for the nation's problems, dismissing the 120,000 COVID-19 deaths and making light of the virus's impact. Trump mocked critics, calling them "sadistic" and "vicious," and encouraged the crowd to boo reporters. He attacked ethnic groups, labeling the coronavirus "Kung Flu," and criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she wanted to impose Somali governance on the U.S. Trump also promoted violence, referring to immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents for using force. He encouraged supporters to arm themselves against protesters and hinted at deploying troops to quell unrest. Trump's campaign, the article concludes, centers on lies, hatred, and the potential for violence, with little regard for constitutional governance.  
END OF SUMMARY.
