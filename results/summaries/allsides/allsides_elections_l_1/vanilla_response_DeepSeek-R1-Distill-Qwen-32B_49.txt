Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's Tulsa rally. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying that Trump tried to relaunch his reelection campaign in Tulsa. He focused on defeating enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and illegal aliens. Instead of talking about prosperity, he ran on strife. He downplayed the virus deaths, joked about testing, and dismissed critics. He attacked various groups, called them names, and even mocked a reporter. He criticized athletes for kneeling during the anthem and linked anarchists to Democrats. He insulted specific politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Bowser, and made ethnic slurs, calling the virus "Kung Flu" and opposing DACA. He pitted black Americans against Latin Americans, blaming Biden for open borders. He also targeted Ilhan Omar, suggesting she'd make the US like Somalia. Trump encouraged violence against immigrants and protesters, praised ICE agents, and suggested sending troops to Seattle. Overall, the article paints Trump as promoting division, hatred, and potential violence in his campaign.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the rally's purpose, his focus on enemies, downplaying the pandemic, attacks on various groups, use of ethnic slurs, encouragement of violence, and the overall tone of division and potential chaos.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without going into too much detail. I'll structure it by first stating the event, then his message, followed by specific attacks and rhetoric, and conclude with the implications of his campaign.
