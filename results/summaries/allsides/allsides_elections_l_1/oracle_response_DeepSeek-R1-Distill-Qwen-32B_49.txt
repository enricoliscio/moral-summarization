Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the context. The article is about President Trump's Tulsa rally where he tried to relaunch his reelection campaign. The author has a critical tone, using words that highlight negative actions and moral issues.

I notice that the user provided a list of morally framed words the author used. I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these as possible. The key points are Trump's focus on enemies, his dismissive attitude towards the pandemic, attacks on various groups, and his encouragement of violence.

I should start by outlining the main events: the rally, Trump's shift to a campaign of conflict, his jokes about the pandemic, and his attacks on journalists, Democrats, immigrants, and others. I'll need to use words like "shrugged," "joking," "insulted," "threatened," "ripped," "ethnic attacks," "slurs," "hate," "violence," and "destruction."

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the rally, then his approach, followed by specific examples of his rhetoric, and ending with the implications of his campaign. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing effectively.

Let me make sure each paragraph in the summary addresses a different aspect: the rally and his message, the attacks on various groups, the encouragement of violence, and the overall negative impact. I'll use the provided words to maintain the moral tone without adding any new ones.

I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and flows smoothly.

SUMMARY:  
At a Tulsa rally, President Trump sought to relaunch his reelection campaign by focusing on enmity rather than achievements, attacking journalists, Democrats, undocumented immigrants, and others. He shrugged off the pandemic's toll, joking about testing and dismissing its severity. Trump insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, and mocked Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she would impose Somali governance on the U.S. He railed against undocumented immigrants, vowed to abolish DACA, and pitted black Americans against Latin Americans. Trump extended his hatred to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging." He also encouraged followers to take matters into their own hands, declaring it "damn nice" to have firearms against protesters. Trump's rhetoric, filled with slurs, insinuations, and ethnic attacks, revealed a campaign rooted in lies, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional norms. His words suggested a second term would bring more hatred, violence, and the acceleration of America's destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
