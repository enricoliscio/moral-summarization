SUMMARY: At his reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, President Trump demonstrated his intention to run on a platform of strife and division, focusing on stoking fear and hatred towards various groups rather than highlighting his accomplishments. He downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, mocked efforts to prevent its spread, and expressed indifference towards the loss of lives. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic slurs and attacks on immigrants, journalists, athletes, and political opponents. He pitted different racial groups against each other and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans. The president encouraged violence and praised those who used force against immigrants and protesters. He even expressed enthusiasm about deploying troops to quell domestic unrest and taught the people of Seattle a lesson. Trump's campaign strategy relies on fostering enmity and appealing to his base's worst instincts. He offers no vision for unity or healing but instead promises more lies, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional governance. Trump is running on a platform that threatens the very fabric of American society and democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
