Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's Tulsa rally. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by saying that Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday night, trying to relaunch his reelection campaign after three months without a rally due to the coronavirus. The main focus of his speech was on defeating various enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and illegal aliens. He's running on a platform of strife rather than prosperity.

He made some controversial statements. For example, he downplayed the 120,000 deaths from COVID-19 by joking about testing and suggested that kids recover quickly from the virus. He criticized the media and other groups, using strong language like "sadistic" and "sinister." He also mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatened the mayor of D.C. regarding statues.

Trump attacked several ethnic groups, calling the virus "Kung Flu," criticizing undocumented immigrants, and opposing DACA. He pitted black and Latin American communities against each other, blaming Biden for open borders. He even made a derogatory comment about a naturalized American, Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she wants the U.S. to be like Somalia.

He also encouraged violence, calling immigrants "animals" and praising ICE agents for using force. He referred to protesters as "thugs" and suggested arming people against them. He even talked about sending troops to suppress unrest, showing enthusiasm for potential violence.

Overall, the article portrays Trump's campaign as focused on division, hatred, and the potential for violence, with little emphasis on his achievements or positive policies.

Now, to summarize this concisely, I need to capture the key points: the rally's purpose, Trump's focus on enemies and division, his dismissive attitude towards COVID-19, attacks on various groups, encouragement of violence, and the overall negative tone of his campaign.

I should structure the summary to highlight these elements without going into too much detail, keeping it under 200 words. I'll make sure to mention the main enemies he targeted, his rhetoric towards different groups, and the violent undertones in his speech. Also, I need to end with the conclusion that his campaign is based on division and potential violence.
