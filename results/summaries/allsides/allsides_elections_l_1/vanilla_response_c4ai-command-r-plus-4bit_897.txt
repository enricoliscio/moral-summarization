SUMMARY: On Saturday, President Trump held a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, his first since the coronavirus outbreak. Instead of focusing on his accomplishments or plans for a second term, Trump's speech was filled with divisive rhetoric, insults, and encouragement of violence. He downplayed the severity of the pandemic, mocked testing efforts, and joked about children contracting the virus. Trump also targeted various groups with ethnic slurs and insinuations, including immigrants, black Americans, and Rep. Ilhan Omar, questioning her loyalty as a naturalized citizen. He praised ICE agents who use force against immigrants and encouraged his supporters to take up arms against protesters. Trump expressed enthusiasm about sending troops to quell domestic unrest and even suggested letting the situation "simmer" to make a political point. The rally highlighted Trump's reliance on stoking division and enmity as a campaign strategy, rather than emphasizing a positive vision for the future. 

END OF SUMMARY.
