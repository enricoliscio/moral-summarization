SUMMARY:
President Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a divisive speech that emphasized strife and enmity over prosperity. He joked about the 120,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus, calling it "Kung Flu," and shrugged off the death toll. Trump devoted his speech to skewering his enemies, labeling them "sadistic," "vicious," "hateful," and "sinister." He ridiculed journalists, athletes, and politicians, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump also directed ethnic attacks at several groups, including naturalized Americans, and challenged their loyalty. He appealed explicitly to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech offered a vision of a second term marked by lies, hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, with the potential for more violence. END OF SUMMARY.
