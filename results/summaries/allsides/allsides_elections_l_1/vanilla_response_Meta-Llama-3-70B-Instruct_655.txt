SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a rally that focused on attacking his enemies rather than promoting his accomplishments. He dismissed the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joked about not testing for infections, and claimed that children who get sick would recover quickly. Trump spent most of his speech insulting and ridiculing various groups, including journalists, Democrats, athletes who kneel during the national anthem, and ethnic minorities. He used ethnic slurs, challenged the loyalty of a naturalized American, and pitted black Americans against Latin Americans. Trump also encouraged violence, calling protesters "thugs" and praising ICE agents who use force against immigrants. He even suggested sending troops to quell domestic unrest and letting protesters "simmer" to teach them a lesson. Overall, Trump's speech was marked by hatred, demagoguery, and a willingness to subvert constitutional government.
