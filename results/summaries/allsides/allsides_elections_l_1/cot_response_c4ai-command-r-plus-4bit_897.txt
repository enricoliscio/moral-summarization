SUMMARY:
At his reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, President Trump presented a vision of America rife with *enemies* and *strife*. He dismissed the 120,000 American lives lost to the *horrible* coronavirus, joking about reduced testing and downplaying the risks to children. Trump's speech was filled with *hatred*, targeting journalists, athletes, protesters, and immigrants. He used *dishonest* and *sinister* labels, encouraging the crowd to boo reporters and denouncing those who knelt during the national anthem. Trump pitted different ethnic groups against each other, spewing *demagoguery* and making racist remarks about black and Latin American communities. He challenged the loyalty of a naturalized citizen, Representative Ilhan Omar, suggesting that she would turn America into "Somalia." The president even encouraged *violence*, praising ICE agents who "swing" at immigrants and expressing eagerness to send troops against domestic protesters. Trump's vision for a second term is clear: more *lies*, more *subversion*, and the potential for increased *violence* and *destruction*.
END OF SUMMARY.
