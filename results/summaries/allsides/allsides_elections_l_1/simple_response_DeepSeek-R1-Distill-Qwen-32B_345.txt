Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's Tulsa rally, but I have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The user wants a summary that's under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I should read the article carefully. It talks about Trump's rally where he tried to restart his reelection campaign. He focused on defeating enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. The article mentions that instead of talking about prosperity, he's running on strife. He downplayed the virus deaths, made offensive remarks about shaking hands with kids, and criticized the media and others. He used derogatory terms, mocked government employees, and attacked specific politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. He also linked Democrats to violence and suggested violence against protesters, even talking about sending troops.

I need to capture the main points: the focus on division, the enemies he listed, his dismissive attitude towards the pandemic, the derogatory language, the attacks on specific individuals, and his encouragement of violence. The moral framing is negative, highlighting Trump's divisiveness, hate, and potential for violence.

I should structure the summary to first mention the rally and its purpose, then outline his strategy of division, the specific groups he attacked, his dismissive pandemic comments, the use of derogatory language, the encouragement of violence, and the overall negative impact on the country. I need to keep it concise, so I'll use strong verbs and adjectives to convey the moral judgment without going into too much detail.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, make sure it's within 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure to include all key points succinctly while maintaining the critical tone.

SUMMARY: At a Tulsa rally, President Trump sought to reignite his reelection campaign by fostering division and hostility, targeting journalists, Democrats, undocumented immigrants, and anarchists as enemies. Instead of focusing on prosperity, he emphasized four more years of conflict, dismissing the 120,000 COVID-19 deaths and trivializing the pandemic. Trump mocked critics, labeled opponents as "sadistic" and "sinister," and encouraged violence against protesters, calling them "thugs." He linked Democrats to violence, attacked politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, and used derogatory terms like "animals" for immigrants. Trump also suggested sending troops to quell unrest, signaling a willingness to condone violence. His rhetoric, filled with lies, hatred, and demagoguery, reflects a deliberate strategy to deepen divisions and undermine democracy, offering a vision of a nation steeped in strife and chaos. END OF SUMMARY.
