SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a divisive speech that emphasized enmity and strife. He shrugged off the 120,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus, joking about testing and recovery times. Trump devoted his speech to skewering his enemies, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and "millions and millions of illegal aliens." He used morally charged language, calling his opponents "sadistic," "vicious," "hateful," and "sinister." Trump also made ethnic attacks, challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American and using slurs against several ethnic groups. He encouraged violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and suggesting that Americans take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech was a preview of what his second term would look like: more lies, hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government. END OF SUMMARY.
