SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than outlining his accomplishments. He shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, joking that testing fewer people would result in fewer infections found. He insulted and threatened various groups, including Democrats, journalists, and athletes who kneel for the national anthem. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, slurs, and insinuations, pitting black Americans against Latin Americans and challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American. He went beyond hatred, appealing explicitly to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. Trump encouraged his followers to take matters into their own hands, saying it's "damn nice" to have firearms when seeing "lunatics" on the streets. He even suggested sending troops to put down domestic unrest, urging the governor of Washington to attack protesters. This is what Trump offers in a second term: more lies, hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, with a possible acceleration of America's destruction.

END OF SUMMARY.
