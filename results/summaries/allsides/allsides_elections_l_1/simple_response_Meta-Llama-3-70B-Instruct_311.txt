SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that centered on enmity, strife, and hatred. Instead of discussing his accomplishments, Trump devoted his speech to attacking and insulting various groups, including journalists, Democrats, anarchists, and ethnic minorities. He joked about the 120,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus, showed disdain for the lives lost, and encouraged violence against protesters and immigrants. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, slurs, and insinuations, challenging the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitting different groups against each other. He appealed explicitly to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech was a stark display of hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, offering a vision of a second term marked by lies, violence, and destruction.
