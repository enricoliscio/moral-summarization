SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, joking about testing fewer people to find fewer infections. He insulted and threatened various individuals, including a government employee, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, slurs, and insinuations, pitting black Americans against Latin Americans and challenging the loyalty of a naturalized American, Rep. Ilhan Omar. He appealed to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at them. Trump encouraged his followers to take matters into their own hands, saying it's "damn nice" to have firearms when facing protesters. He even suggested sending troops to put down domestic unrest, urging the governor of Washington to attack protesters. Trump's speech was a display of hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, promising more lies, violence, and destruction in a second term. END OF SUMMARY.
