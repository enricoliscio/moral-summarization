SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a rally that focused on stirring up strife and hatred towards various groups. Instead of highlighting his accomplishments, Trump devoted his speech to attacking and insulting his perceived enemies, including journalists, Democrats, anarchists, and immigrants. He made light of the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joked about shaking hands with children, and encouraged the crowd to boo reporters. Trump also made ethnic attacks, challenging the loyalty of naturalized Americans and using slurs and insinuations against several ethnic groups. He appealed to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech was filled with lies, hatred, and demagoguery, offering a vision of a second term marked by more division, strife, and potentially even violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
