SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than outlining his accomplishments. He joked about the 120,000 Americans killed by the coronavirus, insulted various groups including journalists, Democrats, and immigrants, and encouraged violence against protesters. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic attacks, challenging the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitting different groups against each other. He even went so far as to suggest that a vote for Joe Biden was a vote for Rep. Ilhan Omar to "decide the fate of your country." Trump's message was clear: he's running on a platform of division, hatred, and violence, and he's not even trying to hide it. His speech was a stark reminder of the dangers of his presidency and the importance of rejecting his divisive rhetoric.

END OF SUMMARY.
