SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that focused on attacking his enemies rather than discussing his accomplishments. He targeted anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and illegal immigrants, and made light of the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus. Trump also directed ethnic attacks at various groups, including naturalized Americans, and challenged the loyalty of Rep. Ilhan Omar. He appealed to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump also suggested that he would enjoy sending troops to put down domestic unrest and implied that it would be better to let protesters suffer to teach them a lesson. Overall, Trump's speech was marked by lies, hatred, and demagoguery, and he seems to be running on a platform of strife and division.

END OF SUMMARY.
