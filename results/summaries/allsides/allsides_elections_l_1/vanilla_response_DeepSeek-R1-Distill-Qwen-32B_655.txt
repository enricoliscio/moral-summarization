Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's Tulsa rally. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article describes Trump's reelection campaign event in Tulsa. He focused on attacking various groups like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He didn't talk much about his achievements but instead criticized his opponents.

He made some controversial statements, like calling the virus "Kung Flu" and criticizing Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she wants to make the U.S. like Somalia. He also mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatened the mayor of D.C.

Trump encouraged violence against protesters and immigrants, calling some "animals" and praising ICE agents. He even suggested using troops to handle domestic unrest, showing a willingness to use force.

Overall, the article portrays Trump's campaign as centered on division, hatred, and promoting violence, rather than discussing policies or achievements.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the rally's focus on attacking enemies, the controversial and divisive rhetoric, the promotion of violence, and the overall negative campaign strategy.
