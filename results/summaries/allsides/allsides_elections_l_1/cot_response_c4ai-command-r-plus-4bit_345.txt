SUMMARY:
At a reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, President Trump spewed enmity and hatred, shrugging off the thousands of Americans who have died from the onslaught of the coronavirus as a "horrible" joke. He skewered his enemies: journalists, Democrats, and immigrants, using racist and sinister slurs like "Kung Flu" and "hombre." He insulted, demonized, and threatened his detractors, pitting Americans against each other along racial lines. Trump encouraged violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and expressing his desire to send troops to put down domestic unrest. He dismissed ethnic attacks and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans, insinuating that Rep. Ilhan Omar wants to turn the US into Somalia. Trump is running on strife, hatred, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional government, promising more lies and violence in his second term. He is accelerating the destruction of America, hiding behind enmity and strife.
END OF SUMMARY.
