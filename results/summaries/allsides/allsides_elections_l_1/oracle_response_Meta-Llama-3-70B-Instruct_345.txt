SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech that was more about stirring up strife and hatred than outlining his accomplishments. He shrugged off the 120,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, joking about testing fewer people to find fewer infections. He insulted and threatened various groups, including Democrats, journalists, and athletes who kneel during the national anthem. Trump's speech was rife with ethnic attacks, slurs, and insinuations, as he challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitted black Americans against Latin Americans. He appealed explicitly to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants with criminal records and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. Trump's speech was a display of hatred, demagoguery, and subversion of constitutional government, with the president openly running on a platform of lies, violence, and destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
