Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about a Trump rally in Tulsa where he tried to restart his reelection campaign. He focused on creating enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. Instead of talking about his achievements, he attacked his opponents, calling them names and encouraging violence. He made derogatory comments about various groups, used offensive terms for the virus, and criticized how the media and others are handling the pandemic. He also talked about using force against protesters and suggested sending troops to Seattle. The author seems critical, framing Trump's actions as harmful and destructive to American values.

So, the summary needs to capture these points succinctly. I should mention the rally, the focus on enemies, the attacks on opponents, the offensive language, the encouragement of violence, and the overall negative impact on American values. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral judgment is clear.

I'll start by stating the event, then outline the enemies he targeted. Next, describe his attacks and the language used. Then, mention the encouragement of violence and the negative implications for the country. Finally, conclude with the author's view that Trump is running on division and destruction.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's concise. I should avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the key moral points. Make sure to include all the main elements without going over the limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
