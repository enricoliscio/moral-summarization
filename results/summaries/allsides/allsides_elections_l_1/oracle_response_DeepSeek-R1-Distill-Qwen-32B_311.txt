Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump's Tulsa rally and his campaign strategy. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and they want me to include as many as possible in the summary. 

First, I need to read the article thoroughly to understand the main points. The article describes Trump's speech, where he focuses on enemies like anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He uses derogatory language and incites violence. The user's summary should highlight these negative aspects.

I should start by identifying the key events and the moral implications. Trump shrugged off the pandemic deaths, joked about testing, insulted various groups, threatened others, and encouraged violence. These actions show a disregard for public health, division, and incitement.

I need to structure the summary to include these elements. I'll mention the rally, his focus on enemies, the use of slurs and threats, the encouragement of violence, and the overall destructive message. I'll make sure to use the provided moral words like "shrugged," "joking," "insulted," "threatened," "slurs," "hate," "violence," etc.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start with the event, then move to his speech content, the language used, and the implications of his message. I'll end by noting the acceleration of destruction and the subversion of democracy.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the author's negative moral stance towards Trump's actions. Avoiding any positive spin, focusing on the divisiveness and incitement. Also, make sure to include as many of the provided moral words as possible without making it seem forced.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence incorporates some of the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure it's clear, concise, and retains the moral critique from the original article.

SUMMARY: At a Tulsa rally, President Trump sought to restart his reelection campaign by focusing on enmity rather than achievements. He shrugged off the 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, joking about reduced testing, and mocked the risks of contracting the virus. Trump insulted journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants, calling them "dishonest," "sinister," and "animals." He threatened Mayor Muriel Bowser over statue removal and ridiculed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, questioning their loyalty. Trump extended his hatred to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging." He encouraged followers to take matters into their own hands, declaring it "damn nice" to have firearms against "lunatics" in the streets. Trump even suggested sending troops to quell protests, showing excitement for potential violence. His campaign, the author argues, runs on lies, demagoguery, and the destruction of constitutional governance, with Trump openly embracing division and chaos. END OF SUMMARY.
