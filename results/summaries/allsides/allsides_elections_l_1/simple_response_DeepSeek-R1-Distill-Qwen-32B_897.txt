Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. The article is about Trump's Tulsa rally and his campaign strategy. The author is critical of Trump's approach, so I should maintain that tone.

First, I'll identify the main points: Trump's focus on enemies, his dismissive attitude towards the pandemic, the use of divisive rhetoric, and the encouragement of violence. I need to condense these into a concise summary without losing the moral critique.

I'll start by stating Trump's campaign is based on division and hostility. Then mention his pandemic response, the mocking of critics, and the attacks on various groups. I'll highlight his use of inflammatory language and the promotion of violence. Finally, I'll conclude with the author's concern about Trump's impact on democracy.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is impactful and to the point. I'll avoid any markdown and stick to a clear, structured summary that reflects the original article's moral stance.

SUMMARY:  
At a Tulsa rally, President Trump sought to reignite his reelection campaign by framing the election as a battle against enemies, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. Instead of focusing on his achievements or the pandemic's toll, Trump mocked the virus's impact, trivialized its consequences, and dismissed critics. He attacked various groups, labeling them "sadistic," "vicious," and "hateful," while encouraging violence against protesters and immigrants. Trump also promoted divisiveness by pitting ethnic groups against each other and threatening federal action against cities. His rhetoric, filled with hostility and demagoguery, reflects a campaign centered on division and conflict rather than unity or progress. The author warns that Trump's second term could further erode democracy and increase violence.  
END OF SUMMARY.
