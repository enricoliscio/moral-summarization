Alright, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about a Trump rally in Tulsa where he's running on a platform of conflict and division. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Trump's approach. 

I should read through the article carefully to identify the key points and the moral terms used. The author uses words like "shrugged," "joking," "insulted," "threatened," etc., which have negative connotations. My summary needs to include as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

I need to structure the summary to highlight Trump's strategy of division, his attacks on various groups, and the moral implications of his rhetoric. I'll start by mentioning the rally and the main theme of enmity. Then, I'll cover his dismissive attitude towards the pandemic, his insults, threats, and use of ethnic slurs. I'll also touch on his encouragement of violence and the overall negative impact he's promoting.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, covering each aspect of his speech and the moral critique. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the author's framing. Finally, I'll conclude by summarizing the author's view that Trump is running on division and destruction.

Let me draft this, making sure to stay within the word limit and include as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: At a Tulsa rally, President Trump sought to reignite his reelection campaign by framing the election as a battle against enemies, including anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He shrugged off the 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, joking about testing and dismissing the virus's severity. Trump insulted journalists, calling them "dishonest," and threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser over statue removal. He also railed against undocumented immigrants, vowed to abolish DACA, and pitted black and Latino communities against each other. Trump used ethnic slurs, calling the virus "Kung Flu," and challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans like Rep. Ilhan Omar. He extended his hatred to violence, dismissing immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praising ICE agents who "start swinging." Trump also encouraged followers to take matters into their own hands, declaring it "damn nice" to have firearms for self-defense. He suggested sending troops to suppress protests, even hinting at letting unrest "simmer" to teach a lesson. The author warns that Trump's campaign, rooted in lies, demagoguery, and violence, aims to accelerate the destruction of American democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
