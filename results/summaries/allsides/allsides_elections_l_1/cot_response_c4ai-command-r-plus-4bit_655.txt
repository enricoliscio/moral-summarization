SUMMARY: Trump relaunched his reelection campaign with a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday night. However, instead of focusing on his accomplishments or plans for a second term, he devoted his speech to stoking enmity and hatred. He joked about the coronavirus pandemic, belittling the loss of life, and shrugging off the need for testing or precautions. Trump's speech was rife with ethnic slurs and attacks on foreigners, naturalized Americans, and political opponents. He insulted reporters, athletes, and protesters, and encouraged violence against those causing unrest. The president threatened to send troops to Seattle to put down protests and took pleasure in the prospect of teaching the city a lesson. Trump's reelection campaign is built on strife, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional government. He is running on a platform of hatred and division, appealing to his supporters' worst instincts. Trump offers no vision for the future but instead promises more of the same: lies, hatred, and the destruction of America as we know it.
END OF SUMMARY.
