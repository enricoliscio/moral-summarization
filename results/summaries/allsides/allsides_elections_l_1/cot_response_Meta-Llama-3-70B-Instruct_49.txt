SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a speech filled with hatred, demagoguery, and divisive rhetoric. He blamed "enemies" such as anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and "millions and millions of illegal aliens" for the country's problems. Trump downplayed the 120,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, joking about testing and recovery times. He attacked his opponents, calling them "sadistic," "vicious," and "hateful," and threatened to punish cities that didn't comply with his demands. Trump also appealed to violence, praising ICE agents who "start swinging" at immigrants and encouraging his followers to take matters into their own hands. His speech was a stark contrast to his campaign promises of four more years of prosperity, instead offering four more years of strife and division. END OF SUMMARY.
