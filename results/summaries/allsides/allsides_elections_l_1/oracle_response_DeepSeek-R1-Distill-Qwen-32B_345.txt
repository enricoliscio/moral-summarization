Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is quite detailed, so I'll start by reading through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article describes a rally in Tulsa where President Trump is trying to restart his reelection campaign. The key moral points are his focus on enmity rather than achievements, his use of derogatory language, and his encouragement of violence. The author uses specific morally charged words like "shrugged," "joking," "insulted," "threatened," etc., which I need to include.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's negative approach, his disregard for the pandemic's impact, his attacks on various groups, and his incitement to violence. I should ensure that the summary flows logically, covering each of these points concisely without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll mention the rally and Trump's focus on enemies. Then, I'll touch on his dismissive attitude towards the pandemic. Next, I'll outline his insults and threats towards different groups, using the specified moral words. I'll also include his encouragement of violence and the overall negative implications of his campaign.

I need to make sure that the summary captures the essence of the article's moral critique without getting bogged down in too many details. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, ensuring that each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit.

After drafting, I'll review the summary to check if it includes as many of the author's morally framed words as possible and that it accurately reflects the article's critical tone. If any points are unclear or if I've missed an important moral aspect, I'll revise accordingly.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY: At a Tulsa rally, President Trump focused on enmity rather than his achievements, attacking anarchists, journalists, Democrats, and undocumented immigrants. He shrugged off the pandemic's 120,000 deaths, joking about testing and claiming COVID-19 recovery was quick. Trump insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, and mocked Rep. Ilhan Omar, suggesting she would run the country like Somalia. He called the virus "Kung Flu," railed against DACA, and pitted black and Latino Americans against each other. Trump dismissed immigrants with criminal records as "animals" and praised ICE agents for "swinging" at them. He encouraged violence, declaring it "damn nice" to have firearms against protesters and suggesting sending troops to quell unrest. Trump's campaign, the author argues, is built on lies, hatred, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional governance, with a clear intent to accelerate America's destruction. END OF SUMMARY.
