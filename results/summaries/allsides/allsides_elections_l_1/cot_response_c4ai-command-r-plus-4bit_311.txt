SUMMARY:
On Saturday night, President Donald Trump relaunched his reelection campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focusing on stoking enmity and strife rather than highlighting his accomplishments. He shrugged off the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, joking about the high death toll and downplaying the risks to children. Trump's speech was filled with hatred and attacks, targeting journalists, athletes, anarchists, and Democrats. He insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatened D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Trump directed slurs and insinuations at various ethnic groups, referring to the coronavirus as "Kung Flu" and pitting black Americans against Latin Americans. He challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar, insinuating that she wanted to turn the U.S. into Somalia. Trump praised violence and encouraged his supporters to take up arms against protesters, expressing his enjoyment at the idea of sending troops to put down domestic unrest. He offered a second term filled with more lies, hatred, demagoguery, and the subversion of constitutional government, running on a platform of accelerating the destruction of America. END OF SUMMARY.
