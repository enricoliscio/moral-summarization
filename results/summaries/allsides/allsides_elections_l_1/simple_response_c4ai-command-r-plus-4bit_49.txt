SUMMARY: Trump's reelection campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on stirring up enmity and strife rather than highlighting his accomplishments or plans for the future. He made light of the coronavirus pandemic and its deadly toll, mocked efforts to test and control its spread, and dismissed the concerns of critics. Trump's speech was filled with ethnic slurs and attacks on various groups, including journalists, athletes, Democrats, immigrants, and people of color. He encouraged violence and praised those who used force against immigrants and protesters. Trump also challenged the loyalty of naturalized Americans and pitted different racial groups against each other. The president showed no remorse or empathy for the victims of the pandemic or racial injustice. Instead, he reveled in the prospect of using military force to crush domestic unrest and teach his political opponents a lesson. Trump's campaign rally revealed his true nature: a demagogue willing to exploit division, hatred, and violence to gain power, with no regard for the well-being of the American people or the principles of constitutional government.
END OF SUMMARY.
