Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about the U.S. House launching the first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment investigation. The main moral issues revolve around whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal gain. The author uses words like "used," "pressure," "misconduct," "actions," "offenses," "using," "crimes," and "misdemeanors." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll identify the core elements: the hearing's purpose, the accusation of using the office for personal gain, the phone call with Zelenskiy, the withheld military aid, the whistleblower, and the political divide. I should structure the summary to highlight these points while using the moral terms.

I should start by stating the purpose of the hearing, then mention the accusation and the specific actions taken by Trump. Including the phone call and the withheld aid will show the misconduct. The whistleblower's role is important, as is the political divide and the comparison to past impeachments.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll make sure to include all the key moral points without making it too lengthy. Also, I should end by noting the constitutional process and the implications, tying back to the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and adjust as necessary. Finally, I'll make sure the summary captures the essence of the article while emphasizing the moral aspects as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House held its first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, focusing on whether the president used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it would shape the future of the presidency and set expectations for presidential conduct. The hearing marked a historic moment, with live broadcasts and real-time commentary, including from Trump himself. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for personal gain ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought investigations into Democrats and withheld military aid as leverage. An anonymous whistleblower alerted officials, prompting the investigation. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," echoing Nixon's defense. The constitutional bar for impeachment is high, and there is no consensus that Trump's actions meet the threshold for "high crimes and misdemeanors." The proceedings highlight the constitutional system of checks and balances, as Trump's presidency faces a force he cannot control. The situation remains divided along partisan lines, with no clear "cancer-on-the-presidency" moment or national shrug, making it more akin to the partisanship of Andrew Johnson's impeachment. END OF SUMMARY.
