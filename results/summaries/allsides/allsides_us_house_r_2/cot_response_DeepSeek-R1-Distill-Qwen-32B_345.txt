Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing of Donald Trump. The task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article, and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a moral connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. So, I should look for words like "pressure," "corrupt," "abuse," etc., that imply wrongdoing or ethical issues.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that have a moral charge. For example, "pressure" is used when talking about Trump using his office to pressure Ukraine, which is a negative action. "Corrupt" is mentioned in the context of the narrative splitting Americans, implying a moral divide. "Abuse" of power is another clear moral term. "Integrity" is about honesty, so that's a positive moral word. "High crimes and misdemeanors" is a legal term but carries a moral weight. "Self-serving" implies acting for one's own benefit, which is morally negative. "Dishonesty" is clearly a moral failing. "Accountability" is about being responsible, a positive moral concept. "Fairness" relates to justice, another moral value. "Betrayal" is a strong negative moral term. "Abuse" again comes up, so it's important. "Good faith" is positive, showing trust. "Corruption" is a negative moral issue. "Integrity" is repeated, so it's significant. "Abuse of power" is a key term in impeachment. "Responsibility" is about duty, a positive moral aspect. "Dishonesty" is mentioned again. "Fairness" is another value. "Betrayal" is emphasized as a serious issue. "Abuse" is central to the impeachment inquiry. "Good faith" is about trustworthiness. "Corruption" is a major concern. "Integrity" is about upholding moral principles. "Abuse of power" is a critical term. "Responsibility" is about accountability. "Dishonesty" is a flaw.
