SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a historic process to determine whether the President should be removed from office. The inquiry centers around whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the answer to this question will affect not only the future of this presidency but also the future of the presidency itself. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's actions towards Ukraine, which allegedly used foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The hearing marks a significant moment in American history, with the country divided along partisan lines. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," but the proceedings will determine whether his actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors" for impeachment.

END OF SUMMARY.
