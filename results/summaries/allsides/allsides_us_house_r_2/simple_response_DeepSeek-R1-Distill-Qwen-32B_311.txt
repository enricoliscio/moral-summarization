Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The key points are that it's the first public hearing, the focus is on whether Trump pressured Ukraine for political gain, and the moral implications of the presidency's integrity. I should highlight the core issue, the witnesses, the political divide, and the constitutional aspects. I'll keep it under 200 words, making sure to include Schiff's statement and Trump's response. Also, mention the historical context without going into too much detail. Need to maintain the moral angle, emphasizing accountability and the stakes for the presidency.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House held its first public impeachment hearing for Donald Trump, focusing on whether he used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain, particularly ahead of the 2020 election. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it would shape the future of the presidency and set expectations for presidential conduct. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for political purposes, including withholding military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into Democrats. Trump dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," echoing Nixon's defense, while the Constitution's vague impeachment standards leave no consensus on whether his actions meet the "high crimes and misdemeanors" threshold. The hearing marks a constitutional test of checks and balances, with no clear galvanizing moment like Watergate or the national indifference seen during Clinton's impeachment. The process reflects deep political polarization, reminiscent of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. END OF SUMMARY.
