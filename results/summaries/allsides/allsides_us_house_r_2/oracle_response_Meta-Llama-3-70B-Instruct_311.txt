SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for using his position for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the inquiry will affect not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, who will testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The narrative is splitting Americans, with Trump calling the inquiry a "witch hunt" and denying any wrongdoing. However, the Constitution sets a high bar for impeachment, and it remains to be seen if Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry stems from Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president, where he pressured him to investigate Democrats and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, while holding military aid as leverage.
