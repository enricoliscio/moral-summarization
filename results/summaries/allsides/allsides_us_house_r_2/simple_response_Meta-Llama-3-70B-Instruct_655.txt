SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the President should be removed from office. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the answer to this question will affect not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The Constitution sets a vague bar for impeachment, and there's no consensus yet that Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the proceedings mark a significant moment in the country's history, with the potential to shape the future of the presidency and the nation's moral standards.

END OF SUMMARY.
