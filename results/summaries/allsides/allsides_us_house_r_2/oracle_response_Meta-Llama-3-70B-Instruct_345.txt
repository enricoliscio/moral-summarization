SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for alleged misconduct. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain, which Rep. Adam Schiff called "as simple and as terrible as that." The hearing marks a remarkable moment, with two seasoned diplomats testifying about Trump's actions towards Ukraine, which may be considered impeachable offenses. The Constitution sets a vague bar for impeachment, requiring "high crimes and misdemeanors," but there's no consensus yet that Trump's actions meet this threshold. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the investigation stems from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" in exchange for military aid, which may be considered using foreign policy for personal gain. The inquiry has sparked a partisan divide, with Trump lashing out at witnesses, but the proceedings may ultimately affect the future of the presidency itself.

END OF SUMMARY.
