Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is on the U.S. House impeachment hearing against Donald Trump, specifically about his interactions with Ukraine. 

I notice the article mentions Rep. Adam Schiff outlining the central issue: whether Trump used his office for personal gain. There's a moral question here about the integrity of the presidency. The hearing is significant because it's the first public one, and it's being broadcast live, which adds to its importance. 

The article also discusses the constitutional aspect, noting that impeachment criteria are vague. Trump's actions, like pressuring Ukraine for investigations, are highlighted as potential high crimes. The moral framing includes the impact on the presidency's future and the expectation of leadership integrity.

I should include the key elements: the hearing's purpose, the moral question, the constitutional context, Trump's response, the witnesses, and the comparison to past impeachments. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral implications without bias.

I'll structure the summary to start with the hearing's purpose, mention the moral question, touch on the constitutional aspect, Trump's actions and response, the witnesses, and conclude with the significance of the hearing in the context of American history. This should effectively convey the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House held its first public impeachment hearing for Donald Trump, focusing on whether the president abused his office by pressuring Ukraine for personal political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the moral stakes, stating the inquiry would shape the future of the presidency and set expectations for presidential conduct. The hearing, broadcast live, marks a historic moment in American politics, with two diplomats testifying about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for political advantage. Trump, calling the process a "witch hunt," accused the witnesses of bias, though they are career diplomats with no clear partisan ties. The constitutional threshold for impeachment remains vague, and public opinion is deeply divided, with comparisons to past impeachments of Nixon and Clinton. The proceedings underscore the tension between accountability and partisanship in the constitutional system of checks and balances. END OF SUMMARY.
