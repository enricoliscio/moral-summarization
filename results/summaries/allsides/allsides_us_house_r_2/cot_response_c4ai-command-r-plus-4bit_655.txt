SUMMARY: Today, the U.S. House launched an extraordinary public hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's conduct. The hearing is focused on whether Trump corruptly pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and if so, whether these actions are impeachable offenses. Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the investigation, described the matter as "simple and terrible." The public is now able to hear and consider the evidence for themselves, including testimony from seasoned diplomats with firsthand knowledge of Trump's unprecedented actions. So far, the narrative of the inquiry is splitting Americans along partisan lines, and there is no consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the vague constitutional bar of "high crimes and misdemeanors." Trump, for his part, has labeled the inquiry a "witch hunt." Whether the proceedings will lead to the end of Trump's chaotic presidency or help secure his position remains to be seen. However, it has brought to light the unethical and unconstitutional nature of his actions, and the importance of upholding the system of checks and balances. This impeachment inquiry, with its unique modern backdrop of real-time commentary and partisanship, may be most comparable to the divisive impeachment of Andrew Johnson after the Civil War. END OF SUMMARY.
