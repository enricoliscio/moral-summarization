Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user wants a concise summary of about 200 words, so I should focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

First, the article mentions that the House launched the first public hearing as part of Trump's impeachment investigation. This is a significant event, so I should include that. The main charge is whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal gain, as outlined by Rep. Schiff. That's a crucial point to highlight.

Next, the hearing is the first opportunity for the public to see the evidence, which includes testimonies from diplomats Taylor and Kent. Their roles and what they're testifying about should be included. The article also notes that the impeachment inquiry is based on Trump's July phone call with Zelenskiy, where he asked for an investigation into Biden and Democrats, using military aid as leverage. That's an important detail to mention.

The anonymous whistleblower and the released transcript are part of the background, so I should touch on that briefly. Pelosi's initial reluctance and her decision to proceed after the whistleblower's complaint is also relevant.

The White House's refusal to allow officials to testify and the subpoenas for witnesses like Taylor and Kent are important to note, as well as Trump's response calling it a witch hunt. The comparison to past impeachments (Nixon, Clinton, Johnson) gives context, so I should include that to show the uniqueness of this situation.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll make sure each key point is covered succinctly. The summary should end with the impact of the hearing on Trump's presidency and the current political climate.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to start with the hearing's purpose, mention the key players and evidence, the context of the phone call, the whistleblower, Pelosi's role, the White House's stance, Trump's reaction, and the comparison to historical impeachments. This should provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of the article.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. House held its first public hearing in the impeachment investigation of Donald Trump, focusing on whether the president used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it would shape the future of the presidency. Testifying diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, are expected to detail Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for political advantage ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought an investigation into Democrats, including Joe Biden, while withholding military aid. An anonymous whistleblower reported concerns, leading to the release of a redacted transcript. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the formal inquiry after the complaint, despite initial reluctance. The White House has barred officials from testifying, but witnesses have appeared under subpoena. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," comparing it to Nixon's defense. The hearing marks a pivotal moment, with no clear consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the constitutional threshold for impeachment. The proceedings reflect a deeply partisan divide, with comparisons to past impeachments, including those of Nixon, Clinton, and Johnson. END OF SUMMARY.
