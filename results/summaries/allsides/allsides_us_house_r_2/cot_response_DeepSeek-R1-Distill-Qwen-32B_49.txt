Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down their instructions.

First, they asked for two steps. Step 1 is identifying all single words with moral framing. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "impeachment," "pressure," "corruption," "abuse," etc. I need to list each on a new line starting with an asterisk.

Next, the summary. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those moral words as possible. I'll need to capture the essence of the article, focusing on the impeachment process, the key players, and the moral implications. I'll mention the hearing, the charges, the witnesses, Trump's response, and the implications for the presidency.

I should ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral tone the author intended. I'll start by outlining the main points: the hearing's purpose, Schiff's statement, the witnesses, the phone call details, the whistleblower, Pelosi's actions, and the political divide. I'll weave in the moral terms naturally.

I also need to remember to separate the steps clearly, using "STEP 1:" and "SUMMARY:" as specified. Keeping each part distinct and within the word limit is important. I'll review the article again to make sure I didn't miss any key morally charged words or points.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to reflect the ongoing debate and the constitutional process, highlighting the moral questions involved. Making sure it's concise yet comprehensive is crucial. I think that's all. Time to put it together.

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. House held its first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, focusing on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it would shape the future of the presidency and set expectations for presidential conduct. The hearing, broadcast live, marked a historic moment as the nation grappled with real-time commentary, including Trump's own tweets dismissing the process as a "witch hunt." Two diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for personal gain ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought investigations into Democrats, including Joe Biden, while withholding military aid. An anonymous whistleblower alerted officials, prompting the investigation. Pelosi initially hesitated but proceeded after the whistleblower's complaint. The White House barred officials from testifying, but witnesses continued to provide evidence. Trump criticized the witnesses, calling them "NEVER TRUMPERS," though they are career diplomats with bipartisan experience. The proceedings highlight the constitutional system of checks and balances, as the nation debates whether Trump's actions constitute "high crimes and misdemeanors." The outcome could determine the presidency's future and the norms of presidential conduct. END OF SUMMARY.
