SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a historic process to determine whether the President should be removed from office. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the answer to this question will affect not only the future of this presidency but also the presidency itself and the kind of conduct the American people may come to expect from their leader. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, who will testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain. The President has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," but the proceedings may ultimately determine the fate of his presidency. The moral implications of Trump's actions are clear: did he abuse his power for personal gain, and what does this say about the kind of leadership the American people deserve?

END OF SUMMARY.
