Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and highlighted certain morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary, using as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. House is holding an impeachment hearing for Trump. The key issue is whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal gain, specifically regarding the 2020 election. There's mention of a phone call where Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, while withholding military aid. The impeachment inquiry is based on the whistleblower's complaint and the Constitution's "high crimes and misdemeanors."

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: used, pressure, misconduct, actions, offenses, using, crimes, misdemeanors. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I'll start by stating the launch of the impeachment hearing, mention Schiff's statement about the core issue. Then, explain Trump's actions, the phone call, the withheld aid, and the constitutional basis. I'll note the split among Americans and the comparison to past impeachments. Finally, I'll conclude with the significance of the hearing in testing the constitutional system.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key moral elements without being redundant. Let me piece this together step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House launched the first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, focusing on whether the president used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Rep. Adam Schiff highlighted the core issue: whether Trump's actions constitute misconduct or offenses under the Constitution's "high crimes and misdemeanors" standard. The hearing marks a rare moment in American history, with real-time commentary and global attention. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, will testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal gain. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," echoing Nixon's defense. The investigation stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he requested an investigation into Joe Biden while withholding military aid. A whistleblower alerted officials, leading to the inquiry. The proceedings are testing the constitutional system of checks and balances, with no clear consensus yet on whether Trump's actions meet the impeachment threshold. The hearing reflects deep divisions in America, reminiscent of past impeachments but unique in its 21st-century context. END OF SUMMARY.
