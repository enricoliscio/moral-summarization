Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about the hearing, the charges, and the political divide. I should focus on the key points: the hearing's purpose, the allegations, the political split, and the constitutional aspects. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens. Let me make sure to include Schiff's quote and the context about the witnesses and the constitutional implications. I should avoid any markdown and just write a concise summary that highlights the moral issues involved, like using office for personal gain and the checks and balances system.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House held its first public impeachment hearing for Donald Trump, focusing on whether the president abused his office by pressuring Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it could set a precedent for future presidencies. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for political advantage ahead of the 2020 election. The hearing highlighted the constitutional divide over what constitutes "high crimes and misdemeanors," with Trump dismissing the process as a "witch hunt." The inquiry stems from Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought investigations into Democrats, including Joe Biden, while withholding military aid. The whistleblower's complaint and the release of a redacted transcript have fueled the debate. The proceedings underscore the tension between the constitutional system of checks and balances and the partisan nature of the impeachment process, reminiscent of past impeachments but unique in its 21st-century context. END OF SUMMARY.
