SUMMARY:
The U.S. House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for using his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff called it a "terrible" matter that will affect the future of the presidency. The hearing is a chance for the public to see and hear for themselves about Trump's actions toward Ukraine and consider whether they are "impeachable offenses." Trump calls the inquiry a "witch hunt," but two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, will testify about the president's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" while holding military aid as leverage. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but witnesses have appeared behind closed doors to tell investigators what they know. The hearing marks a moment where Trump's chaotic term has finally arrived at a place he cannot control. END OF SUMMARY.
