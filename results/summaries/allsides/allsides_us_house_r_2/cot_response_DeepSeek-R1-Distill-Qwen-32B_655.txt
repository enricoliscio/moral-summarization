Okay, so I need to help this user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the user's instructions carefully. They provided a news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user has two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

In STEP 1, I need to extract all single words that carry moral implications. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "impeachment," "extraordinary," "pressure," "misconduct," etc. These words convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, for the summary, I have to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes those moral terms. I need to capture the essence of the article, highlighting the key points about the impeachment inquiry, the charges, the witnesses, Trump's response, and the implications. I should maintain the moral framing by using words like "abuse," "pressure," "favor," "corruption," and "high crimes."

I also need to ensure that the summary is clear and flows well, covering the main events without getting too detailed. It should reflect the division among Americans and the constitutional process involved.

I'll structure the summary to start with the hearing, mention the charges, the witnesses, Trump's reaction, and the implications for the presidency. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to preserve the author's framing.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered. I'll make sure the summary is objective but retains the moral elements from the original text.

### SUMMARY:
The U.S. House held its first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, focusing on whether he abused his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the situation, stating it could set a precedent for future presidencies. Witnesses, including seasoned diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for his 2020 election campaign. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," echoing Nixon's defense. The hearing marks a constitutional test, with no consensus yet on whether Trump's actions meet the threshold for "high crimes and misdemeanors." The narrative has split Americans along partisan lines, with the process unfolding in real-time amid social media commentary. The outcome could determine whether Trump's presidency ends or continues, reflecting the constitutional system's checks and balances. END OF SUMMARY.
