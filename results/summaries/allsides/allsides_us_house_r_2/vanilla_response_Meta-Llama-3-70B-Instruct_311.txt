SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has launched the first public hearing of the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump. The hearing, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, aims to determine whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, are testifying about Trump's actions towards Ukraine, which are alleged to be impeachable offenses. The inquiry stems from a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine's president, where Trump asked for an investigation into Democrats and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but many have appeared behind closed doors. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt" and tweeted "READ THE TRANSCRIPT" in response. The hearing marks a significant moment in the impeachment process, with the country divided along partisan lines.
