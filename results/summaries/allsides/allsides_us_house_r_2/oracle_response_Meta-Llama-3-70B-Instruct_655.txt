SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for using his position for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the inquiry will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testifying about Trump's actions toward Ukraine, which allegedly involved using foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the Constitution sets a dramatic but vague bar for impeachment, and there's no consensus yet that Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" to investigate Democrats and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, while holding military aid as leverage.

END OF SUMMARY.
