SUMMARY:
The U.S. House launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president used his office for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff outlined the core question: did Trump pressure Ukraine officials for personal benefit? Schiff emphasized that the answer will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief. The hearing is a remarkable moment, with two seasoned diplomats testifying about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump calls the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the narrative is splitting Americans, mostly along partisan lines. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, asking for a "favor" while holding military aid as leverage. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but witnesses have appeared behind closed doors, telling investigators what they know. END OF SUMMARY.
