SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, with Rep. Adam Schiff outlining the core question of whether the president used his office for personal political gain. The hearing features testimonies from two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, who will share their experiences with Trump's actions towards Ukraine. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for an investigation into Democrats and Joe Biden in exchange for military aid. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but many have appeared behind closed doors to share their knowledge. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt" and tweeted "READ THE TRANSCRIPT," but Democrats argue that the president's actions may be impeachable offenses. The hearing marks a significant moment in the impeachment process, with the country watching and waiting to see if Trump's actions will lead to his removal from office.
