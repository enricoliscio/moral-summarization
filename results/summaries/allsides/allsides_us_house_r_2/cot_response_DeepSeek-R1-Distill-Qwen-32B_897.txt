Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the impeachment hearing of Donald Trump. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Hmm, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "extraordinary," "terrible," "pressure," "misconduct," "impeachable," "witch hunt," "favor," "leverage," "high crimes and misdemeanors," "chaotic," "checks and balances," "cancer," "partisanship." 

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the moral framing. I'll start by stating the event, the core issue, the key players, and the implications. I should mention the hearing, Schiff's statement, the witnesses, Trump's response, the constitutional threshold, and the comparison to past impeachments. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects like the pressure on Ukraine, the potential misuse of office, and the political divide. 

I need to keep the summary clear and focused, ensuring it captures the essence of the article while preserving the moral elements. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the hearing, moving to the allegations, the political reactions, and the implications for the presidency and democracy. I'll avoid getting too detailed but ensure all key points are covered succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  

The U.S. House held its first public impeachment hearing for Donald Trump, focusing on whether the president used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it could set a precedent for future presidencies. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy to benefit his 2020 campaign, including withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for investigations into political rivals. Trump dismissed the proceedings as a "witch hunt," echoing past defenses. The Constitution's vague impeachment standard leaves no consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the threshold for "high crimes and misdemeanors." The hearing marks a chaotic moment in Trump's presidency, testing the constitutional system of checks and balances. Unlike past impeachments, it reflects deep partisanship rather than a unifying crisis.  

END OF SUMMARY.
