SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a historic process to determine if the president should be removed from office. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the answer to this question will impact not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, who will testify about Trump's alleged misuse of foreign policy for personal and political gain. The narrative has split Americans, with Trump calling the inquiry a "witch hunt" and Democrats pushing for accountability. The Constitution sets a high bar for impeachment, and it remains to be seen if Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" in exchange for military aid. The hearing marks a critical moment in American history, as the country grapples with the limits of presidential power and the importance of accountability.
