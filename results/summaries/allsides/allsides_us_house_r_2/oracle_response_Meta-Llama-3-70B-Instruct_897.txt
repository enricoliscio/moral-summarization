SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for alleged misconduct. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain, which Rep. Adam Schiff called "as simple and as terrible as that." The hearing marks a remarkable moment, as the country considers whether Trump's actions towards Ukraine constitute impeachable offenses. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, will testify about the president's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the Constitution sets a high bar for impeachment, and there's no consensus yet that his actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" in exchange for military aid, sparking concerns about his actions and potential offenses.
