Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user provided the article and an example response, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the first public hearing in Trump's impeachment investigation. It mentions Rep. Adam Schiff outlining the key issue: whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal gain. The hearing includes testimonies from diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. The Constitution's vague impeachment standards are discussed, and Trump's response is noted as calling it a witch hunt. The origin of the inquiry is Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president, where he requested an investigation into Biden and withheld military aid. Pelosi's initial reluctance and the whistleblower's role are also mentioned. The White House's refusal to allow officials to testify and the subpoenas for witnesses are part of the process. The article compares this to past impeachments and suggests it's more partisan like Andrew Johnson's case.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the first public hearing, the key issue, the testimonies, the constitutional standards, Trump's response, the phone call details, Pelosi's actions, the whistleblower, and the comparison to past impeachments. I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all critical points without going into too much detail.

I'll structure it as follows: Introduce the hearing, explain the core issue, mention the witnesses, discuss the constitutional aspect and Trump's reaction, detail the phone call and military aid, Pelosi's involvement, the whistleblower, the White House's stance, and conclude with the comparison to historical impeachments.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid unnecessary details. Also, I should make sure the summary starts with the key information and ends with the broader context or implications.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each sentence covers a main point without exceeding the word limit.

The U.S. House held its first public hearing on Donald Trump's impeachment, focusing on whether he pressured Ukraine for personal gain. Rep. Adam Schiff highlighted the core issue, with testimonies from diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. The Constitution's vague standards for impeachment were noted, as Trump dismissed the process as a witch hunt. The inquiry stems from Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president, requesting an investigation into Biden while withholding military aid. Pelosi initially hesitated but proceeded after a whistleblower's complaint. The White House barred officials from testifying, but witnesses were subpoenaed. The hearing reflects a partisan divide, akin to Andrew Johnson's impeachment, highlighting the constitutional checks and balances in Trump's presidency. 

END OF SUMMARY.
