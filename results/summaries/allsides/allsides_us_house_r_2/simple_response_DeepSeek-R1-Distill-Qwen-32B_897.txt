Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the U.S. House starting the impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The key points are the investigation into whether Trump pressured Ukraine for personal gain, the role of Rep. Schiff, the witnesses, and the context of past impeachments.

I should highlight the moral aspects, like the potential misuse of power and the implications for the presidency. I need to mention the phone call with Zelenskiy, the withheld military aid, and the whistleblower. Also, the political divide and the comparison to past impeachments are important for the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to include the main events, the moral questions raised, and the current state of the investigation. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure each sentence adds value and maintains the ethical implications discussed in the article.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives held its first public impeachment hearing for Donald Trump, focusing on whether the president abused his power by pressuring Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it could redefine expectations for presidential conduct. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, are set to testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for political advantage ahead of the 2020 election. The investigation stems from Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought an investigation into Joe Biden and withheld military aid as leverage. An anonymous whistleblower alerted officials, prompting the probe. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," echoing Nixon's defense. The proceedings highlight a constitutional reckoning, with no clear consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the "high crimes and misdemeanors" threshold. The hearing marks a pivotal moment in Trump's presidency, with implications for the future of American democracy and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
