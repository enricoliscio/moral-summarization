SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine if the president should be removed from office for using his position for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the inquiry will affect not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testifying about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" to investigate Democrats and his potential rival, Joe Biden, while holding military aid as leverage. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but witnesses have appeared behind closed doors, revealing Trump's alleged misconduct and offenses. The hearing marks a significant moment, as the country decides whether Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors."
