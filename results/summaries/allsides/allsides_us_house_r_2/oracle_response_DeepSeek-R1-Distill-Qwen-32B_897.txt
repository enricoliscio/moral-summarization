Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used. They provided a list of morally framed words: used, pressure, misconduct, actions, offenses, using, crimes, misdemeanors. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The House launched the first public hearing for Trump's impeachment, focusing on whether he used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal gain. Schiff mentioned it's about whether the president's actions constitute misconduct. The hearing is significant because it's the first time the public can see the evidence. Witnesses include diplomats Taylor and Kent, who will testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for political gain. The Constitution's vague standards for impeachment mean there's no consensus yet on whether Trump's actions meet the threshold. Trump calls it a witch hunt and criticized the witnesses, but they are career diplomats. The outcome could impact the presidency's future.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the morally framed words. I should start with the hearing's purpose, mention Schiff's statement, the witnesses, Trump's actions, the constitutional standards, and the implications. I'll make sure to include words like "used," "pressure," "misconduct," "actions," "offenses," "using," "crimes," and "misdemeanors."

I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the hearing, the allegations, the witnesses, Trump's response, and the constitutional context. I need to keep it concise but comprehensive, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I incorporate the moral language and stay within the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure it's under 200 words. Once done, I'll review to ensure all required elements are included and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. House held its first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, focusing on whether the president used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the inquiry, stating it could define the future of the presidency and set expectations for presidential conduct. The hearing marked a historic moment, with live broadcasts and real-time commentary, including from Trump himself. Witnesses, including diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, are set to testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a "witch hunt," but the Constitution's vague standards for impeachment leave no consensus on whether his actions meet the threshold for "high crimes and misdemeanors." The proceedings highlight the constitutional system of checks and balances, with Trump's chaotic term facing a force he cannot control. The outcome could shape the presidency's future, though no "cancer-on-the-presidency" moment has emerged yet. END OF SUMMARY.
