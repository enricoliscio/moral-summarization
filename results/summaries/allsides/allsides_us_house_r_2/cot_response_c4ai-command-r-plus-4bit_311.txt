SUMMARY: 
The U.S. House of Representatives launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for alleged wrongdoing. The hearing focuses on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine for personal political gain, with Rep. Adam Schiff stating that the matter is "as simple and as terrible as that." The inquiry stems from Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked for a "favor" while withholding military aid. The White House has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but witnesses have appeared to testify about Trump's alleged corrupt activities. The impeachment process is a chaotic and unprecedented event, with no clear consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the bar of "high crimes and misdemeanors." Whether the proceedings lead to Trump's removal or not, they represent a force of constitutional checks and balances that the president cannot ignore. The situation has not yet galvanized public opinion like the Watergate hearings, nor resulted in a national shrug as with Bill Clinton's impeachment. Instead, it resembles the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson post-Civil War.
