SUMMARY:
The U.S. House launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for using his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff called it a "terrible" matter that will affect the future of the presidency. The hearing is a chance for America to see and hear about Trump's actions toward Ukraine and consider whether they are impeachable offenses. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified, telling a striking story of a president allegedly using foreign policy for personal and political gain. Trump calls the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the Constitution sets a dramatic bar for impeachment. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, when he asked for a "favor" while holding military aid as leverage. The White House has instructed officials not to testify, but witnesses have appeared behind closed doors to tell investigators what they know. The proceedings will determine whether Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." END OF SUMMARY.
