SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has launched its first public hearing into the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. The inquiry is centered around whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized that the answer to this question will affect not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's actions towards Ukraine, which allegedly involved using foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The hearing is a significant moment, with the country having only been in this situation three times before. The Constitution sets a vague bar for impeachment, and there is currently no consensus on whether Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt" and tweeted "READ THE TRANSCRIPT" in response.

END OF SUMMARY.
