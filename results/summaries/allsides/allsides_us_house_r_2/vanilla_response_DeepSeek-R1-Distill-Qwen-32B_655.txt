Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about the U.S. House's impeachment hearing for Donald Trump. The user has specified that the summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are:

- The House launched the first public hearing for Trump's impeachment.
- Rep. Adam Schiff highlighted the core issue: using office for personal gain.
- Witnesses include diplomats William Taylor and George Kent.
- The hearing is significant due to real-time media coverage.
- Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president is central.
- The call involved asking for an investigation into Biden and Democrats, with military aid as leverage.
- A whistleblower alerted officials, leading to the inquiry.
- Pelosi was initially hesitant but proceeded after the complaint.
- The White House is refusing to cooperate, but witnesses are testifying under subpoena.
- Trump's reactions and the comparison to past impeachments.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, ensuring all key points are included without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the hearing, then the main allegations, the role of the whistleblowers, the witnesses, and the political context.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, make sure to mention the significance of the hearing in the context of real-time media and the comparison to past impeachments to give context.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure it doesn't exceed 200.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House held its first public hearing for Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry, focusing on whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the gravity of the issue, stating it could set a precedent for presidential conduct. Witnesses included diplomats William Taylor and George Kent, who detailed Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for political advantage ahead of the 2020 election. The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he sought an investigation into Joe Biden and Democrats, using military aid as leverage. An anonymous whistleblower reported concerns, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to initiate the inquiry. Despite Trump's claims of a "witch hunt," witnesses are testifying under subpoena, highlighting the constitutional process's significance. The hearing marks a unique moment in U.S. history, with real-time media coverage, and reflects ongoing partisanship reminiscent of past impeachments. END OF SUMMARY.
