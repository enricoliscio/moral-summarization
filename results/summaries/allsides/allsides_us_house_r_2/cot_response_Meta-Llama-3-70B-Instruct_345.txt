SUMMARY:
The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain, which Rep. Adam Schiff called a "terrible" and "simple" matter. The hearing marks a remarkable moment, as the country has only been here three times before. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, will testify about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has called the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the narrative is splitting Americans, mostly along partisan lines. The Constitution sets a dramatic but vague bar for impeachment, and it's unclear if Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry has sparked a constitutional crisis, with Trump's chaotic term finally arriving at a place he cannot control. END OF SUMMARY.
