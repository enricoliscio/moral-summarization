SUMMARY:

The US House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a historic process to determine whether the President should be removed from office. The inquiry centers on whether Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized that the answer to this question will affect not only Trump's presidency but the future of the office itself. Two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, testified about Trump's alleged use of foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. The narrative has split Americans, with Trump calling the inquiry a "witch hunt." The Constitution sets a vague bar for impeachment, and it's unclear if Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors." The inquiry stems from Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where he asked for a "favor" to investigate Democrats and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden. The hearing marks a significant moment in Trump's presidency, where his chaotic term has finally reached a point he cannot control.
