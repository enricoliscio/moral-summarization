SUMMARY:
The U.S. House has launched the first public hearing of Donald Trump's impeachment investigation, a process to determine whether the president should be removed from office for using his position for personal political gain. Rep. Adam Schiff outlined the core question: did Trump pressure Ukraine officials for personal benefit? Schiff emphasized that the answer will affect not only the future of this presidency but also the presidency itself and what kind of conduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief. The hearing features two seasoned diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, telling a striking story of a president allegedly using foreign policy for personal and political gain ahead of the 2020 election. Trump calls the inquiry a "witch hunt," but the narrative is splitting Americans, mostly along partisan lines. The Constitution sets a dramatic but vague bar for impeachment, and there's no consensus yet that Trump's actions meet the threshold of "high crimes and misdemeanors."
END OF SUMMARY.
