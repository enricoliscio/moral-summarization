SUMMARY:

The article argues that Alabama's recent anti-abortion bill is not about protecting fetuses, but about controlling women, particularly poor women. The bill's passage is seen as a hypocritical move by 25 white male lawmakers who prioritize gun rights over women's reproductive rights. The article suggests that the bill aims to maintain the social order, keeping poor people poor and women in their place. The author believes that the bill's intention is to overturn Roe v Wade, and that incremental erosion of abortion rights may be a more effective tactic. The bill will disproportionately affect women without means, who will be forced to travel long distances for a procedure that is illegal in their home state. The article concludes that the bill is about maintaining patriarchal control, and that its passage is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
