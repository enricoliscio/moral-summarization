SUMMARY:
Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers have passed a radical anti-abortion bill, exposing their hypocricies and unfairness towards women, particularly poor women. The bill is not about protecting the foetus, but about eliminating women as a threat to the social order, ensuring they stay home and poor people stay poor. The law has a chilling effect, stripping women of control over their reproductive health and lives. It's a measure designed to shame and punish women, especially those without means to travel for an abortion. The bill is a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade, and its passage is a disturbing reminder of the existential threat to women's rights. The consequences of this law will be devastating, forcing women to carry babies with severe fetal abnormalities to term or travel vast distances for a frightening procedure. END OF SUMMARY.
