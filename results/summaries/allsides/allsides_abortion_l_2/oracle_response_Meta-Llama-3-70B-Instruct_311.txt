SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers is riddled with hypocrisies and inconsistencies. These lawmakers, who claim to value life, are against banning guns, citing that "banning things doesn't work". Yet, they are willing to criminalise women who choose to have an abortion, forcing them to carry a pregnancy to term, even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. This ban is not about protecting the foetus, but about eliminating women, particularly poor women, as a threat to the social order. It's about ensuring that poor people stay poor and women stay in their place. The law is a chilling existential threat to women's reproductive health and autonomy, forcing them to travel vast distances for a procedure that is illegal at home. The intention behind this law is clear: to overturn Roe v Wade. The author argues that this is not about fairness or justice, but about control and power.

END OF SUMMARY.
