SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by 25 white male lawmakers in Alabama's state senate is a hypocritical and criminalizing move that targets poor women and aims to eliminate them as a threat to the social order. The bill's radical ban on abortion is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling women's lives and ensuring they stay in their place. It's a measure designed to keep poor people poor and women subservient. The lawmakers' logic is inconsistent, as they argue that banning things doesn't work when it comes to guns, but somehow expect it to work for abortion. The bill's passage is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and a threat to women's reproductive health and autonomy. It's a move to shame and force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, and to overturn Roe v Wade. The bill will disproportionately affect poor women who cannot travel to access abortion services, forcing them to stay in a state of reproductive servitude.

END OF SUMMARY.
