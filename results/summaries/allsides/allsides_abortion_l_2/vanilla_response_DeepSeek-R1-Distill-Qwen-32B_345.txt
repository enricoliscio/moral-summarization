Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about Alabama's anti-abortion bill and the criticism it's receiving. It mentions the hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun control but support abortion bans. They argue that banning things doesn't work for guns but do it for abortion, which seems contradictory.

The article also points out that the focus isn't really on the fetus but on controlling women, especially poor ones. It's about keeping women at home and ensuring poor people stay poor. There's a mention of the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment on the law. The author is frustrated because overturning Roe v Wade is the real goal, and the bill is designed to make abortions inaccessible for most women.

I need to capture the main points: the hypocrisy of the lawmakers, the real intent to control women, the impact on poor women, the legal battle ahead, and the comparison to other social issues like mass incarceration. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and to the point. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s recent anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun bans but support abortion restrictions, despite their claim that “banning things doesn’t work.” It argues that the focus is not on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, by limiting their reproductive rights and reinforcing societal inequality. The bill effectively forces women without resources to carry pregnancies to term, even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, while wealthier women can travel out of state for abortions. The law reflects a broader strategy to chip away at Roe v. Wade and control women’s lives, with the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court appointment. The article emphasizes the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and the legal battles ahead, questioning the intent behind such restrictive measures. END OF SUMMARY.
