Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Alabama's anti-abortion bill and the moral issues surrounding it. 

First, I should identify the main points. The author criticizes the Alabama lawmakers for their stance on abortion, pointing out their hypocrisy, especially regarding their support for gun rights. They argue that the focus isn't on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones. The bill is seen as a way to keep women, especially poor ones, in their place. 

The article also mentions the impact of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and the potential long-term effects of the bill, like forcing women to carry babies with abnormalities. It's critical of the incremental approach to overturning Roe v Wade and the practical barriers women face in accessing abortions, like traveling out of state.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral judgment against the lawmakers, the control over women, and the systemic issues. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key moral points without losing the author's perspective.

Let me structure it: Start with the criticism of the lawmakers' hypocrisy, then the real focus on controlling women, especially the poor. Mention the consequences like forced pregnancies and the impact of Kavanaugh. End with the practical barriers and the intent behind the bill.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and impactful, reflecting the author's strong moral stance.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun control but support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." The focus is not on fetal life but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, to maintain social order. The bill forces women to carry pregnancies to term, even with severe abnormalities, and disproportionately affects those unable to travel for abortions. It reflects a broader strategy to overturn Roe v Wade incrementally, with Brett Kavanaugh’s influence exacerbating the threat. The law’s intent is clear: to limit women’s autonomy and reinforce systemic inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
