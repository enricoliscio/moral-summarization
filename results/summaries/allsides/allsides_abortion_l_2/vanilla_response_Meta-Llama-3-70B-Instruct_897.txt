SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Alabama's recent anti-abortion bill, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, as hypocritical and inconsistent. It argues that the bill is not about protecting fetuses, but about controlling women, particularly poor women, and maintaining the social order. The bill's supporters are accused of not acting in good faith, but rather seeking to restrict women's reproductive rights and maintain the status quo of poverty and oppression. The article suggests that the bill's intention is to overturn Roe v Wade, and that it will disproportionately affect poor women who cannot travel out of state for an abortion. The author expresses anger and frustration at the bill's passage, seeing it as a threat to women's lives and autonomy. The article concludes that the bill's real purpose is to keep women in their place and maintain the existing power structures.
