SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by 25 white male lawmakers in Alabama's state senate is a hypocritical and radical measure that threatens the lives and autonomy of women, particularly poor women. By banning abortion, these lawmakers are effectively eliminating women as a threat to the social order, ensuring that poor people stay poor and women stay home. This law is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling women's bodies and lives. It's a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, which aims to overturn Roe v Wade. The law will disproportionately affect women without means, forcing them to carry babies with severe fetal abnormalities to term or travel vast distances for a procedure that is illegal at home. The author argues that trying to shame abortion-banners for their unfairness to women is futile, as their intention is to restrict women's freedom and autonomy. This law is a moral outrage that seeks to banish women's hard-won rights and force them back into a state of subservience.
