Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about Alabama's anti-abortion bill passed by white male lawmakers. It points out the hypocrisies, like how they oppose banning guns but support banning abortions, using the argument that "banning things doesn't work." That's a contradiction, so I need to highlight that.

The author criticizes the lawmakers for valuing the life of a fetus over the life of a child born into poverty, especially since Alabama voted to repeal Obamacare. This shows a lack of concern for the well-being of mothers and their children, so that's an important moral point.

The article also argues that the real focus isn't on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones. It's about maintaining the social order and keeping women at home, which is a gendered power dynamic. This is a strong moral critique, so I need to include that.

The comparison to mandatory minimum sentencing and its impact on black people is another layer of moral judgment. It's saying that the abortion ban is similarly harmful and intentional in its targeting of a group, so that's a key point.

The article mentions Brett Kavanaugh's appointment affecting the law, which ties into the broader political implications and the existential threat to women's rights. This is a significant point for the summary.

It also discusses the practical impact: women with means can travel out of state, but others are forced into unsafe situations. This highlights the class divide and the burden on marginalized women, which is a moral issue about access and justice.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements while maintaining the author's critical tone. I should structure it to first present the hypocrisies, then the focus on controlling women, the comparison, political implications, and the impact on different groups. Make sure to end with the intended message of the law, which is to keep women in their place.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and impactful. Let me piece this together, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, highlighting its moral inconsistencies. The bill’s supporters, who oppose gun bans, argue that "banning things doesn’t work," yet they support restricting abortion. The author questions their good faith, suggesting the focus is not on fetal life but on controlling women, particularly poor ones. The law is seen as a tool to maintain social order, forcing women to bear unwanted pregnancies, often with severe fetal abnormalities, and burdening those without means to travel for abortions. The article compares this to mandatory minimum sentencing’s disproportionate impact on marginalized groups, arguing the bill is designed to keep women in their place. It also ties the law to Brett Kavanaugh’s influence and the broader threat to Roe v. Wade. The bill’s practical effect is to limit access to abortion, disproportionately affecting vulnerable women, reinforcing systemic inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
