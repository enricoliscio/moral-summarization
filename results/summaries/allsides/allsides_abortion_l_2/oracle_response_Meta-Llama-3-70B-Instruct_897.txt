SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers is riddled with hypocrisies and inconsistencies. These lawmakers, who are against banning guns, are quick to criminalise women who seek abortions, while claiming to value the "life" of a six-week-old foetus. However, their true intention is to eliminate women, particularly poor women, as a threat to the social order, ensuring that they stay poor and submissive. This ban is about controlling women's bodies and lives, forcing them to carry pregnancies to term, and bearing the consequences of sex alone. The bill's passage is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, and its ultimate goal is to overturn Roe v Wade. Meanwhile, people of means will find ways to access abortions, but for everyone else, the emotional and imaginative investment required to travel for a frightening procedure will be too much, effectively forcing them to stay in their circumstances. The author argues that this bill is not about protecting foetuses, but about maintaining a patriarchal social order.
