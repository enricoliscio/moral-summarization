Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Alabama's anti-abortion bill. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how Alabama's white male lawmakers passed a strict anti-abortion bill. It points out the hypocrisies, like how they oppose banning guns but support banning abortions, even though both involve restrictions. It also mentions that these lawmakers prioritize the "life" of a fetus over the well-being of poor mothers, especially since Alabama repealed Obamacare. The author argues that the focus isn't on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, to maintain the social order.

The article also connects this bill to Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, suggesting it's part of a strategy to overturn Roe v Wade. It notes that while the bill will face legal challenges, the intention is clear. Wealthy women can still get abortions by traveling out of state, but poor women are disproportionately affected, making it harder for them to access safe abortions. The bill's real aim is to control women and keep them in their place, which is why it passed despite the obvious issues.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight the key points: the bill's passage, the hypocrisies, the focus on controlling women, the impact on poor women, the connection to Kavanaugh, and the legal challenges ahead. I'll make sure it's concise and covers all the main arguments without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Alabama’s recent anti-abortion bill, passed by its 25 white male lawmakers, has sparked criticism for its hypocrisy and focus on controlling women, particularly poor ones. The bill, which effectively bans abortion, is seen as a move to overturn Roe v. Wade and maintain social order by limiting women’s autonomy. Critics argue that the lawmakers prioritize the “life” of a fetus over the well-being of poor mothers, especially in a state that repealed Obamacare. The bill disproportionately affects low-income women, who face barriers to accessing abortions, such as travel costs and emotional stress. The article connects the bill to Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment, suggesting it reflects a broader strategy to restrict women’s reproductive rights. Wealthy women can still access abortions out of state, but for others, the law is a significant burden. The bill’s passage highlights its intent to control women and reinforce gender roles, with legal challenges expected to delay its implementation. END OF SUMMARY.
