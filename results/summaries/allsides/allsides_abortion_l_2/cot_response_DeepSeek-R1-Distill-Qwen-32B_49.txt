Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user has given me a news article and wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They have specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article, and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a strong moral connotation, often indicating approval or disapproval. They might include words like "hypocrisy," "injustices," "oppression," etc.

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence and pick out words that have such connotations. For example, "inconsistencies," "hypocrisies," "banning," "criminalise," "oppression," "elimination," "unfairness," "shame," "chilling effect," "existential threat," "control," "oppression," "incrementalists," "illegal," "fear," "oppression," "oppression," "oppression," "oppression," "oppression."

Once I have all these words, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of the article's moral arguments against Alabama's abortion ban.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 listing each moral word, followed by the SUMMARY section. I have to make sure to start each moral word with a * and keep the summary within the word limit.

I should check that the summary accurately reflects the article's critical stance towards the abortion ban, highlighting issues like hypocrisy, control over women, and the impact on marginalized groups. It's important to maintain the moral framing to convey the author's perspective effectively.

Alright, I think I have a plan. I'll start by listing all the morally framed words, then craft a summary that weaves these words in naturally, ensuring the moral critique is clear and the summary stays within the word limit.

### SUMMARY:  
The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun control but support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." It argues that the focus is not on fetal life but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, to maintain social order. The bill is seen as a tool to oppress women, forcing them to carry pregnancies to term, especially those without means to travel for abortions. The article compares this to mandatory minimum sentencing, which disproportionately affects marginalized groups. The law reflects the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment and aims to overturn Roe v Wade, with incremental tactics to chip away at reproductive rights. For many, the cost and emotional burden of traveling for illegal abortions are too much, which is precisely why the bill passed. The summary emphasizes the moral failings and oppressive intent behind the legislation.  
END OF SUMMARY.
