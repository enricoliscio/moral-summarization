SUMMARY:
Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers have passed an anti-abortion bill, revealing their hypocrisy and unfairness towards women, particularly poor women. The bill is not about protecting the foetus, but about controlling and eliminating women as a threat to the social order. It's about ensuring poor people stay poor and women stay home. The law has a chilling effect, forcing women to lose control of their reproductive health and, consequently, their lives. The intention behind the law is to overturn Roe v Wade, and it's hard not to feel angry about it. Meanwhile, people of means will find ways to access abortions, but for everyone else, it's an emotional and imaginative investment that may be too much to bear. The bill's message is clear: stay where you are. END OF SUMMARY.
