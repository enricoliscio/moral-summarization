SUMMARY: Alabama's abortion ban, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, has revealed the true intentions of those seeking to criminalise abortion and ensure women, particularly poor women, are eliminated as a threat to the social order. The bill is not about the foetus, but about controlling women's lives and keeping them in their place. It is an attempt to shame and force women to stay home, bearing the consequences of sex and childbirth alone. This ban shows the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, threatening to overturn Roe v Wade and take away women's control over their reproductive health. While people of means can fly out of state for abortions, poor women will be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, facing emotional and financial hardships. The bill's passage is a blatant act of hypocrisy and a clear attempt to ban abortion and ensure women stay where they are in terms of social and economic status.

END OF SUMMARY.
