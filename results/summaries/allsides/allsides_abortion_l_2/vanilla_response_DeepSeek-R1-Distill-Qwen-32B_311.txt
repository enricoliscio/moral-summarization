Alright, I need to summarize this article about Alabama's anti-abortion bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of Alabama's lawmakers who passed the bill. It mentions that Republicans who oppose abortion support gun rights, arguing that bans don't work, which is hypocritical. The focus is on the value placed on a fetus over the life of a child born into poverty, especially since Alabama repealed Obamacare. The author questions the lawmakers' good faith, suggesting they don't care about women's health but instead aim to control women, particularly poor ones.

The article also connects the bill to Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, fearing it could overturn Roe v Wade. It discusses the practical impact: women with means can travel out of state, but others face significant barriers, making abortion inaccessible. The law is seen as a tool to maintain social order by keeping women home and poor people poor.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll highlight the key points: the hypocrisy of lawmakers, the focus on controlling women, the impact on poor women, the connection to Kavanaugh, and the practical barriers to accessing abortion. I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all main arguments without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s recent anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose abortion bans while supporting gun rights, claiming that "banning things doesn’t work." It argues that the bill prioritizes the "life" of a fetus over the well-being of women, particularly poor women, and is designed to control women’s reproductive rights and maintain social order. The law is seen as part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade, with Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court raising fears of its potential impact. The article notes that while wealthy women can access abortion out of state, poor women face significant barriers, including travel costs and emotional stress, making the procedure effectively inaccessible. The bill’s passage reflects a broader effort to restrict women’s autonomy and reinforce inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
