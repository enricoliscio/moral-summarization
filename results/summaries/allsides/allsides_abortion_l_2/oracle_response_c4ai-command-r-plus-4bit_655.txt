SUMMARY: Alabama's abortion ban, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, has revealed the true intentions behind the law, which are to criminalise and eliminate women, particularly poor women, as a threat to the social order. The ban ensures that poor people stay poor and women stay home, with no control over their reproductive health and lives. The bill was passed to shame and force women to stay where they are, with the consequences of sex being borne by the woman. This is a blatant act of hypocrisy and unfairness by the lawmakers, who have shown no concern for the health and well-being of women. The appointment of Brett Kavanaugh has had a chilling effect, with the intention to overturn Roe v Wade and chip away at women's hard-earned rights. The ban will have a devastating impact on women in Alabama, particularly those without the means to travel out of state for an abortion, making it an emotional and costly investment. The bill is a blatant attack on women's rights and freedom, and it is hard not to feel angry and outraged at such a blatant display of control and incarceration of women's bodies.
END OF SUMMARY.
