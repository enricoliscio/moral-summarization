SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by 25 white male lawmakers in Alabama's state senate is a hypocritical and inconsistent move that targets women, particularly poor women, to maintain the social order. The lawmakers' logic is flawed, as they prioritize the "life" of a six-week-old fetus over the life of a born child and its mother. This ban is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling women's bodies and reproductive health. It's a measure designed to keep poor people poor and women in their place. The bill's intention is to overturn Roe v Wade, and its implementation will disproportionately affect women without means to travel for an abortion. The author argues that this ban is not about fairness or the health of women, but about maintaining the status quo of patriarchal power.
