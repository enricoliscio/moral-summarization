SUMMARY:

The article discusses the recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers, highlighting the inconsistencies and hypocrisies behind their decision. While they argue that banning abortion is necessary to protect life, they also oppose banning guns, citing that "banning things doesn't work". The article suggests that the real intention behind the bill is to control women's bodies and maintain the social order, particularly for poor women. The ban will disproportionately affect low-income women who cannot travel to access abortion services. The article also notes that the bill is a result of the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and is likely to be stuck in federal district court for years. The author argues that the bill is not about protecting fetuses, but about eliminating women's autonomy and reinforcing patriarchal norms.
