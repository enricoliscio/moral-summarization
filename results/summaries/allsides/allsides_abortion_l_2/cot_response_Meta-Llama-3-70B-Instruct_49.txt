SUMMARY:
The passage critiques the Alabama state senate's passage of an anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy and unfairness of the 25 white male lawmakers who voted for it. The author argues that the bill is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling and eliminating women, particularly poor women, as a threat to the social order. The bill is designed to keep poor people poor and women in their place. The author sees the bill as an existential threat to women's lives, forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies to term and bear the consequences of sex alone. The bill's intention is to overturn Roe v Wade, and its passage has a chilling effect on women's reproductive health. The author's tone is one of anger and frustration, wondering when enough is enough. END OF SUMMARY.
