SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers is a hypocritical and inconsistent move that targets poor women and aims to maintain the social order. The lawmakers' logic is flawed, as they prioritize the "life" of a six-week-old fetus over the life of a born child and its mother. This ban is not about the fetus, but about controlling women's bodies and reproductive health. It's a radical measure designed to keep poor people poor and women in their place. The ban will disproportionately affect poor women who cannot afford to travel to other states for an abortion. The author argues that this move is not about protecting life, but about eliminating women as a threat to the social order. The ban is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and a step towards overturning Roe v Wade.
