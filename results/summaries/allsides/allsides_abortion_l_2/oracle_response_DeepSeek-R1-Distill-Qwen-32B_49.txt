Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Alabama's anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun bans but support abortion bans. The author argues that the bill targets poor women, effectively controlling them and maintaining social order.

I need to identify the key morally framed words: hypocrisies, banning, criminalise, elimination, threat, ensure, stay, shame, sentencing, incarceration, appointment, control, forced, borne, banished, overturning, chipping, investment, hard, much.

I'll start by noting the main arguments: the lawmakers' hypocrisy, the focus on women rather than the fetus, the impact on poor women, and the broader implications of the bill. I should make sure to include words like "hypocrisy," "banning," "criminalize," "elimination," and "control" to maintain the moral tone.

I also need to mention Brett Kavanaugh's appointment as a contributing factor and the legal challenges ahead. The article suggests that the bill is a step towards overturning Roe v Wade, which is another key point.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points succinctly, using the moral terms. I'll ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, ending with the impact on poor women and the broader societal control.

Let me draft it, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral framing without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure clarity.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisies of lawmakers who oppose gun bans but support abortion bans, despite their claim that "banning things doesn’t work." The focus is not on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, ensuring they remain subservient and unable to access abortions. The bill is seen as part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v Wade, with incremental efforts chipping away at reproductive rights. Poor women face the hardest burden, as traveling for illegal abortions becomes an emotional and financial investment, often too much to bear. The law’s chilling effect reflects the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh and the threat it poses to women’s autonomy, forcing them to carry pregnancies to term or endure unsafe procedures. The article underscores the moral failure of a system designed to eliminate women’s agency and maintain social control. END OF SUMMARY.
