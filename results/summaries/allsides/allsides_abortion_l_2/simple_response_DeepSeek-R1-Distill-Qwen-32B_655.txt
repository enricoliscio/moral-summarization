Alright, so I've got this query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break it down.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand its main points and the author's stance. The article discusses Alabama's anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral and political hypocrisies of the lawmakers. It points out inconsistencies, like opposing gun bans while supporting abortion bans, which the author finds hypocritical.

The author argues that the focus isn't on the fetus but on controlling women, especially poor ones. This ties into systemic issues like poverty and women's autonomy. The article also mentions the impact of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment on such laws and the potential for the bill to be stuck in court, but the intention is clear: to overturn Roe v Wade.

I need to capture these points succinctly. The summary should reflect the author's critical view, emphasizing the bill's implications on women's rights and social control. I'll make sure to include the key arguments about hypocrisy, control, and systemic oppression without getting bogged down in details.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the bill, then the criticisms, followed by the broader implications and the author's stance. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the most impactful points.

Also, the user wants the summary after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly without any markdown. I'll ensure the language is clear and concise, preserving the moral framing as the author intended.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun bans but support abortion restrictions, despite their claim that "banning things doesn’t work." The author argues that the focus is not on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor women, reinforcing systemic oppression. The bill is seen as a tool to maintain the social order, ensuring poverty and limiting women’s autonomy. It also notes the bill’s potential to remain in court for years, with the clear intent to overturn Roe v Wade. The author compares the situation to mandatory minimum sentencing, where the consequences disproportionately affect marginalized groups. The law’s impact is chilling, as it forces women to carry pregnancies to term, even in dire circumstances, while those with means can seek abortions elsewhere. The summary underscores the bill’s intent to control women’s lives, reflecting a broader pattern of incremental attacks on reproductive rights. END OF SUMMARY.
