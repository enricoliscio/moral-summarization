SUMMARY:
Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers have passed an anti-abortion bill in the state senate, exposing their hypocrisy and inconsistency. By banning abortion, they are prioritizing the "life" of a six-week-old fetus over the life of a child born to a poor mother, who they are willing to abandon by repealing Obamacare. This radical ban is not about the fetus, but about controlling women, particularly poor women, and maintaining the social order. It's about shaming women and forcing them to stay home. The law has a chilling effect, threatening women's reproductive health and lives. The intention is clear: to overturn Roe v Wade. While people of means will find ways to access abortions, others will be forced to travel vast distances, facing emotional and imaginative investments. The bill's message is clear: stay where you are. END OF SUMMARY.
