Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Alabama's anti-abortion bill and the critique of it. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral arguments presented.

The author points out the hypocrisy of Alabama's white male lawmakers who oppose banning guns but support banning abortion, using the argument that "banning things doesn't work." This is a moral critique because it highlights the inconsistency in their stance on regulation.

Another point is that these lawmakers prioritize the "life" of a fetus over the life of a child born into poverty, especially in a state that repealed Obamacare. This is a moral argument against their priorities, suggesting they care more about symbolic issues than real problems affecting women and children.

The author also argues that the abortion ban isn't about protecting the fetus but about controlling women, particularly poor women. This is a strong moral statement, implying that the law is a tool to suppress women's autonomy and maintain social order.

The article draws a parallel between abortion bans and mandatory minimum sentencing, both targeting marginalized groupsâ€”women and black people respectively. This comparison underscores the systemic oppression, adding a layer of moral judgment on the lawmakers' intentions.

There's a mention of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment affecting the law's chilling effect, suggesting that conservative judicial appointments are enabling such restrictive laws, which is another moral critique of the political process.

The author expresses anger over the potential overturning of Roe v Wade and the impact on women's lives, especially those without means to travel for abortions. This highlights the moral failing in how the law disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized.

The summary needs to capture these points succinctly, emphasizing the hypocrisy, control over women, systemic oppression, and the broader implications of such laws. I should make sure to include the key moral arguments without getting bogged down in the details of the legal process or the political figures involved.

I need to ensure that the summary is under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main moral critiques: hypocrisy, prioritization of fetus over women's lives, control over women, systemic oppression, and the impact on marginalized groups. I'll also mention the potential overturning of Roe v Wade as a significant concern.

Let me structure this: start with the critique of the lawmakers' hypocrisy, then move to the focus on controlling women, the comparison to other oppressive policies, the impact on poor women, and the broader implications of the law.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and concise, making sure each moral point is clearly stated. I'll also need to end with the mention of the law's potential to overturn Roe v Wade and its impact on women's autonomy.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary that flows well and covers all the key moral points without exceeding the word limit.
