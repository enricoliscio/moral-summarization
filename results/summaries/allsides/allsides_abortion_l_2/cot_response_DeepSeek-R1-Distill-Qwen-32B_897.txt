Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main tasks: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, write a concise summary using those words.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "inconsistencies," "hypocrisies," "banning," "precious," "means," "criminalise," "disinclination," "good faith," "health," "focus," "elimination," "poor," "stay home," "shame," "unfairness," "advocates," "incarceration," "existential threat," "control," "reproductive health," "lost," "fetal abnormalities," "consequence," "borne," "banished," "Roe v Wade," "overturning," "angry," "militia," "incrementalists," "chipping away," "effective," "illegal," "too much," "passed," "stay."

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. I should focus on the key points: the hypocrisy of Alabama lawmakers, the impact on poor women, the comparison to other social issues, the legal challenges, and the broader implications for women's rights.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, ensuring each sentence reflects the author's framing. I'll mention the lawmakers' actions, the contradiction in their policies, the focus on women's control, the comparison to other injustices, the legal battle, and the intended suppression of women.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating the morally charged words. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's moral arguments.

**SUMMARY:**  

The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun control yet support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." It argues that the focus is not on fetal life but on controlling women, particularly poor women, by limiting their reproductive freedom. The bill is seen as a tool to maintain social order and keep women in subservient roles. The author draws parallels to other injustices, such as mandatory minimum sentencing disproportionately affecting Black people, suggesting the abortion ban is similarly designed to harm marginalized groups. The law’s radical nature reflects an existential threat to women’s autonomy, as it forces those without means to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. The article also notes the bill’s likely legal challenges and its broader goal of overturning Roe v Wade, emphasizing the anger and frustration it evokes. The summary highlights the moral implications of the law, its impact on poor women, and its connection to broader social control.
