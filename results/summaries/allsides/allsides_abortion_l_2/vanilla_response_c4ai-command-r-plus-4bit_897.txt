SUMMARY: This week, 25 white male lawmakers in Alabama passed a restrictive anti-abortion bill in the state senate, sparking outrage and criticism for its inconsistencies and hypocrisies. The bill, which is likely to be stuck in federal district court for years, aims to overturn Roe v. Wade and severely restricts abortion access in the state. The author argues that the bill is not about the fetus, but about controlling women, particularly poor women, and ensuring they stay in their place. The bill is part of a larger strategy to chip away at abortion rights, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them altogether. While people of means will still be able to access abortions out of state, the bill creates significant barriers for those without financial resources, effectively trapping them. The intention behind the bill is clear and has sparked anger and frustration, with many questioning the true motives of the lawmakers who supported it.
END OF SUMMARY.
