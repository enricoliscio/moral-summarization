Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language.

The article discusses Alabama's anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose banning guns but support banning abortion. The author points out the inconsistency in valuing fetal life over the lives of poor women. The bill is seen as a tool to control women, especially poor ones, reinforcing social order. The author compares this to mandatory minimum sentencing affecting black people, showing the deliberate targeting. The appointment of Brett Kavanaugh is linked to this chilling effect, and the law is seen as a step towards overturning Roe v Wade. The impact on women without means is significant, forcing them into difficult situations. The article ends by noting the incremental strategy to chip away at Roe v Wade.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. I'll focus on the key moral points: hypocrisy, banning, elimination, threat, control, forced, borne, overturning, chipping, investment, hard, much.

I should structure the summary to highlight the hypocrisy, the targeting of poor women, the control aspect, and the broader implications on women's rights. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words without making the summary too long.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral terms are preserved.
