Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The author uses a lot of strong words, so I should make sure to include those. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about Alabama's anti-abortion bill passed by white male lawmakers. It highlights the hypocrisies, like how they oppose gun bans but support abortion bans. The author argues that the focus isn't on the fetus but on controlling women, especially poor ones. They mention the impact on women's autonomy and how the law is part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v Wade.

I should include words like hypocrisies, banning, elimination, threat, control, forced, borne, overturning, etc. I need to make sure the summary captures the moral critique without going over 200 words.

Let me structure the summary: start with the lawmakers and their hypocrisies, then the real focus on women, the consequences, and the strategy to overturn Roe. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the author's perspective effectively.

I should check that I'm not adding any new information and that the summary flows logically. Also, make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of politicians who oppose gun bans yet support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." The author argues that the focus is not on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor women, as a means to maintain social order and ensure poverty persists. The law is seen as an existential threat to women’s autonomy, forcing them to carry pregnancies to term or face severe consequences. The author compares this to the impact of mandatory minimum sentencing on black incarceration, emphasizing the deliberate targeting of vulnerable groups. The bill’s radical nature suggests an intention to overturn Roe v Wade, with the author noting that only wealthy women can afford abortions by traveling out of state, while others are trapped. The law’s design to "stay" in place, limiting access, reflects a broader strategy to chip away at reproductive rights. The moral framing underscores the elimination of women’s control over their bodies and the forced burden of pregnancy, echoing the systemic oppression women have long faced. END OF SUMMARY.
