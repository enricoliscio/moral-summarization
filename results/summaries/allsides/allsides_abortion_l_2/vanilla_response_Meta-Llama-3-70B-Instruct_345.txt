SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the Alabama state senate's passage of an anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy and inconsistencies of the 25 white male lawmakers who voted for it. It argues that the bill is not about protecting fetuses, but about controlling women, particularly poor women, and maintaining the social order. The article suggests that the bill is designed to keep poor people poor and women in their place. It also notes that the bill's passage is a direct result of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and is likely to be stuck in federal district court for years. The article concludes that the bill's intention is to overturn Roe v Wade, and that people with means will find ways to access abortions, but those without means will be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.
