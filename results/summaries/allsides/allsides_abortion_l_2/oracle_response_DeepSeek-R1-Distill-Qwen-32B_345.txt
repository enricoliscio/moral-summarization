Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses Alabama's anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral and ethical issues surrounding it. It points out the hypocrisies of the lawmakers, such as their stance on banning guns versus banning abortion. The author argues that the bill isn't about protecting the fetus but controlling women, especially poor ones. The article also mentions the potential impact of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and the long-term implications of the law.

Now, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the article that I must include: hypocrisies, banning, criminalise, ban, elimination, threat, ensure, stay, shame, sentencing, incarceration, appointment, control, forced, borne, banished, overturning, chipping, investment, hard, much.

I'll start by outlining the main arguments: the inconsistency in policies, the focus on controlling women, the impact on poor women, and the broader implications of such laws. I'll make sure to incorporate the listed words naturally into the summary without making it sound forced.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it by first addressing the hypocrisies and then the intent behind the ban, followed by the consequences and the broader context of Kavanaugh's influence.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral framing words. I'll avoid adding my own opinions but stick to the author's perspective.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure all key points are covered and that the moral terms are appropriately used. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisies of lawmakers who oppose banning guns but support banning abortion, despite their claim that "banning things doesn’t work." The focus is not on the fetus but on controlling women, particularly poor ones, as the law aims to eliminate their autonomy and ensure they remain confined to traditional roles. The bill forces women to carry pregnancies to term, even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, and makes abortion access difficult for those without means, effectively criminalizing their choices. The author argues that this is a threat to women’s control over their lives, reminiscent of pre-Roe v. Wade times. The law is seen as part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade incrementally, with wealthy women able to travel out of state for abortions while others are left stranded. The bill’s passage reflects a deliberate effort to ensure poor women stay poor and women stay home, reinforcing the notion that the consequences of sex are borne by women. The moral framing underscores the elimination of women’s rights and the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment on reproductive freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
