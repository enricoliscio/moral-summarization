SUMMARY: The passage highlights the hypocrisy and ulterior motives of Alabama's male lawmakers who passed an extreme anti-abortion bill, arguing that it is not about protecting fetal life but about controlling women, especially poor women, and maintaining social inequality. The bill is seen as a threat to women's reproductive rights and freedom, with the intention of overturning Roe v. Wade. The author argues that the bill is designed to discourage women from seeking abortions by creating emotional, financial, and logistical barriers, particularly for those with limited resources. The passage also mentions the potential impact of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment on abortion rights and the feeling of anger and powerlessness that many are experiencing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
