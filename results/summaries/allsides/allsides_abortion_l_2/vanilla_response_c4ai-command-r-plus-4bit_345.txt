SUMMARY: Alabama's recent passing of a restrictive anti-abortion bill has sparked outrage and criticism, highlighting the hypocrisy and inconsistencies of the 25 white male lawmakers behind it. The bill, which is likely to be stuck in federal district court for years, aims to overturn Roe v. Wade and severely restrict women's reproductive rights, particularly targeting poor women. Critics argue that the bill is not about the fetus but about controlling women and maintaining social order by ensuring they stay home and poor. The bill's passage demonstrates the chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court, with many feeling angry and frustrated about the rollback of reproductive rights. While people of means will still be able to access abortions out of state, the bill creates significant emotional, financial, and logistical barriers for those without resources, effectively telling them to "stay where you are."
