Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using those words.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about Alabama's anti-abortion bill and the moral implications. The article criticizes the lawmakers for hypocrisy, pointing out their stance on gun control versus abortion. It also discusses how the bill affects poor women and the broader implications on women's rights.

For the first step, I need to extract all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong ethical or value-based connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "inconsistencies," "hypocrisies," "banning," "precious," "struggle," "criminalise," "disinclination," "good faith," "health," "focus," "elimination," "poor," "home," "shame," "unfairness," "advocates," "mandatory," "incarceration," "chilling," "existential threat," "control," "reproductive health," "forced," "abnormalities," "term," "consequence," "banished," " Roe v Wade," "overturning," "angry," "militia," "incrementalists," "chipping away," "effective," "means," "illegal," "courage," "clinic," "frightening," "distances," "too much," "passed," "stay."

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: the hypocrisy of the lawmakers, the impact on poor women, the comparison to other social issues, the legal implications, and the overall moral stance against the bill.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, maintaining the moral tone of the original article. I'll structure it to highlight the key criticisms and the broader implications of the bill, ensuring that the morally framed words are integrated seamlessly.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose gun control but support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." It argues that the bill prioritizes the "precious" life of a fetus over the well-being of poor women, effectively forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies. The law is seen as an "existential threat" to women’s control over their reproductive health, disproportionately affecting those without means to travel for abortions. The article compares the bill to policies causing systemic inequality, such as mandatory minimum sentencing for black people. It suggests the bill is part of a broader strategy to overturn Roe v Wade, with incremental efforts to chip away at abortion rights. The moral framing emphasizes the elimination of women’s autonomy and the entrenchment of poverty, making the bill a chilling reminder of the ongoing struggle for reproductive justice.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
