SUMMARY:
Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers have passed an anti-abortion bill, showcasing their hypocrisy and lack of good faith. The bill is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling women, particularly poor women, and maintaining the social order. It's about ensuring that poor people stay poor and women stay home. The law has a chilling effect, threatening women's reproductive health and lives. The intention behind the law is clear: to overturn Roe v Wade. While people of means will find ways to access abortions, others will be forced to travel vast distances, facing emotional and imaginative barriers. The bill's passage is a clear message: stay in your place. The author's anger and frustration are palpable, wondering when someone will take a stand against this existential threat to women's autonomy. END OF SUMMARY.
