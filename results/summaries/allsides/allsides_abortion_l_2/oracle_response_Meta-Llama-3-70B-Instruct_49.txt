SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers is rife with hypocrisies and inconsistencies. These lawmakers, who claim to value "life," are willing to criminalise women who seek abortions, while ignoring the struggles of children born into poverty in a state that repealed Obamacare. The ban is not about protecting the foetus, but about eliminating women, particularly poor women, as a threat to the social order. It's about ensuring that poor people stay poor and women stay home. The law is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, threatening to overturn Roe v Wade and forcing women to lose control of their reproductive health. The bill is designed to shame and control women, particularly those without means to travel, who will be forced to carry babies with severe fetal abnormalities to term. The author argues that this ban is not about fairness, but about maintaining a patriarchal social order. END OF SUMMARY.
