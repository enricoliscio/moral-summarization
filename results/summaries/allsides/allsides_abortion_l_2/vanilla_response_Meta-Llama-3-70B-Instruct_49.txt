SUMMARY:

The article argues that Alabama's recent anti-abortion bill, passed by 25 white male lawmakers, is not about protecting the life of a fetus, but about controlling women, particularly poor women. The bill is seen as a radical measure designed to maintain the social order, keeping poor people poor and women at home. The author suggests that the lawmakers are not acting in good faith, and that the ban is about eliminating women as a threat to the social order. The article also notes that the ban will disproportionately affect poor women who cannot travel to other states for an abortion. The author expresses anger and frustration, wondering when someone like Elizabeth Warren will take a stand against such laws. The article concludes that the bill is part of a larger strategy to chip away at Roe v Wade, and that people of means will find ways to access abortions, while others will be left behind.
