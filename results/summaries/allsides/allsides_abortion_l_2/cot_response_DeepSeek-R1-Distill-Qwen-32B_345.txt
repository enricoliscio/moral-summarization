Okay, so I'm trying to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, so I need to make sure I adhere to that. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. The user mentioned that these words are single words, so I'll go through the text and pick out each one.

Looking at the article, I see words like "inconsistencies," "hypocrisies," "banning," "criminalise," "good faith," "health," "foetus," "women," "elimination," "threat," "incarceration," "existential threat," "control," "reproductive health," "means," "courage," "illegal," "stay." These all seem to carry moral connotations.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I should start by highlighting the main points: the criticism of Alabama's lawmakers for their stance on abortion, the hypocrisy in their arguments, and the impact on women, especially poor ones. I'll also mention the comparison to other social issues and the broader implications of the law, like the potential overturning of Roe v Wade.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use words like "hypocrisies," "elimination," "existential threat," and "control" to convey the critical perspective. I'll also touch on how the law affects access to abortion, making it difficult for those without means, which ties back to the moral issue of inequality.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the criticism, moving to the impact on women, and ending with the broader implications and the effectiveness of the law. I need to keep it within the word limit, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are covered.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques Alabama’s anti-abortion bill, highlighting the moral hypocrisy of lawmakers who oppose banning guns but support banning abortion, claiming "banning things doesn’t work." The focus on fetal life over the well-being of women, especially poor ones, is condemned. The law is seen as an attempt to control women’s lives, particularly those without means, forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies. This reflects a broader strategy to undermine women’s autonomy and maintain social order. The comparison to mandatory minimum sentencing for black incarceration underscores the law’s discriminatory intent. The bill’s radical nature, aiming to overturn Roe v Wade, is viewed as an existential threat to women’s reproductive rights. For many, accessing abortion in Alabama is already difficult, and the law makes it even harder, effectively trapping women in unwanted situations. The moral framing emphasizes the law’s chilling effect on women’s lives and its role in perpetuating inequality.
