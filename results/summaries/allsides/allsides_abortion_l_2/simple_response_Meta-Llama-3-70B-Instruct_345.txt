SUMMARY:

The passage critiques the Alabama state senate's anti-abortion bill, highlighting the hypocrisy and inconsistencies of the 25 white male lawmakers who passed it. The author argues that the bill is not about protecting the fetus, but about controlling and oppressing women, particularly poor women. The ban is seen as a measure to maintain the social order, keeping women in their place and perpetuating poverty. The author suggests that the lawmakers are not acting in good faith, but rather seeking to eliminate women as a threat to the status quo. The bill's passage is viewed as a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, threatening women's reproductive health and autonomy. The author notes that while people of means will find ways to access abortions, those without means will be disproportionately affected, forced to carry pregnancies to term or travel long distances for a procedure that is illegal at home.
