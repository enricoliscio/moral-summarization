SUMMARY: There are many moral inconsistencies and hypocrisies in the actions of Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers who passed an extreme anti-abortion bill. Their supposed 'good faith' is questionable given their disregard for women's health and lives. The focus is not on the fetus but on controlling and eliminating women, especially poor women, as a threat to social order. The bill is designed to keep poor people poor and women at home. Shamefully, these lawmakers do not care about being unfair to women, just as advocates of mandatory minimum sentencing have caused the disproportionate incarceration of black people. The chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment further underscores the threat to reproductive rights. While the bill may be stalled in federal court, the intention to overturn Roe v. Wade is clear and anger is justified. Incrementalists will continue chipping away at Roe, while those with means will travel out of state for abortions, leaving poorer women with limited options and facing immense emotional and practical barriers. The bill's underlying message is clear: stay where you are, women of Alabama. END OF SUMMARY.
