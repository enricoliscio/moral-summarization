SUMMARY:

The recent anti-abortion bill passed by Alabama's 25 white male lawmakers is a thinly veiled attempt to control and oppress women, particularly poor women. The hypocrisy of these lawmakers is evident in their selective concern for "life" and their willingness to criminalize women's choices. The bill is not about protecting fetuses, but about maintaining the social order that keeps women in their place. It's a radical measure designed to ensure that poor people stay poor and women stay home. The ban will disproportionately affect women without means, who will be forced to carry pregnancies to term or travel long distances for a procedure that is illegal in their home state. The bill's passage is a chilling effect of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment and a clear attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. The author argues that this is not about fairness or good faith, but about maintaining a patriarchal society that restricts women's autonomy and freedom.
