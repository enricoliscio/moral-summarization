SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama and how they reflect the polarized and polarizing nature of the abortion debate in the United States. While New York's law liberalized abortion access, Alabama's law imposed a near-total ban. The article analyzes how these laws are out of step with the attitudes of most Americans, who generally support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term abortions. It also explores the political and legal landscape, including the impact of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise. The article suggests that the extreme positions taken by both sides are a result of the Roe decision and that overturning it could lead to a more nuanced debate that reflects the complexities of public opinion. However, the underlying political reality is that both parties are driven by activists and donors, resulting in increasingly absolutist positions.
