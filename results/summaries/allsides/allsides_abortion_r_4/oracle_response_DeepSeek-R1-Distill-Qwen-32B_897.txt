Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York, the reactions from both sides, and the impact of Roe v. Wade. The author criticizes both extremes and suggests that the media's focus is biased.

I should start by mentioning the extreme laws in both states, using words like "pushing" and "allowing." Then, I'll note President Trump's statements about "execution" and how they were called a "lie" and "distortion." I'll include the context about Tran's bill and Northam's comments, using "legislation" and "bill."

Next, I'll address the media's reaction, using "yawned" for New York and "frenzy" for Alabama. I need to explain how Roe v. Wade "imposed" abortion rights and "foreclosed" state compromise, leading to polarization. 

I should also mention the split in the pro-life movement between incrementalists and those pushing for extreme measures. Finally, I'll conclude by highlighting the media's role in "highlighting" extremes and the need for compromise.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it too convoluted. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political divide over abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting extreme positions on both sides. President Trump accused Democrats of "pushing" late-term abortions, describing it as "allowing children to be ripped from their mother’s womb," a claim labeled a "lie" and "distortion" by critics. Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's bill, which would have legalized abortions up to the 40th week, was part of a trend in liberal states to loosen abortion laws, while Alabama's near-total ban is seen as an unconstitutional "law" designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. The media's "yawned" reaction to New York's law contrasts with the "frenzy" over Alabama's, reflecting a biased stance. The article argues that Roe v. Wade "imposed" a permissive regime, "foreclosing" state-level compromise and polarizing the debate. Both extremes—late-term abortions and total bans—ignore public support for compromise, as most Americans favor early-stage abortions but oppose those in the third trimester. The pro-life movement is split between incrementalists and those seeking to "go for broke," while the media "highlight" rare cases to "focus" on extremes. The author suggests that overturning Roe might not defuse passion but could eventually lead to laws "reflecting" majority opinion. END OF SUMMARY.
