SUMMARY:
The Alabama abortion law has sparked controversy, with President Trump accusing Democrats of promoting "late-term abortion" and "executing" babies. However, fact-checkers say this is a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks. The law is seen as extreme, but so is the New York law that allows late-term abortions. Polls show most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's differing reactions to the two laws reveal their bias. The Alabama law is unconstitutional, but its sponsors hope the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade. This could lead to a more polarized debate, with each side accusing the other of extremism. Overturning Roe might not defuse the passion, but it could allow states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion. END OF SUMMARY.
