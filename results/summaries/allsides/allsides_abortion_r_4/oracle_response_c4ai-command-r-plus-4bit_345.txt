SUMMARY: Protesters are rallying against Alabama's new abortion law, which is considered extreme by many Americans. President Trump has accused Democrats of pushing for late-term abortions, even until the moment of birth, a claim that has been fact-checked and deemed a distortion and exaggeration. The controversy stems from remarks made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam and a proposed bill by delegate Kathy Tran, which sparked debates about the moral and ethical boundaries of abortion. The media has also been accused of biased coverage, with more attention given to Alabama's law than New York's similar legislation. The article argues that the Roe v. Wade decision has contributed to the polarization of the abortion debate, preventing state-level compromise and pushing both pro-choice and pro-life movements towards more absolutist positions. Alabama's GOP legislators have deliberately passed an unconstitutional law, hoping the conservative majority in the Supreme Court will overthrow Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, New York's Democratic lawmakers aim to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The underlying political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but the parties are influenced by activists and donors, resulting in more extreme positions being taken. The debate is often dominated by rare and emotionally charged cases, further polarizing the discussion.
