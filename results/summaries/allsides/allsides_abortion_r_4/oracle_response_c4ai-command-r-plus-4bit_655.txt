SUMMARY: The abortion debate in the United States has been marked by extreme positions taken by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, with little room for compromise. While the American people generally support early-stage abortions, opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media has largely ignored New York's liberal abortion law while remaining fixated on Alabama's near-total abortion ban. This discrepancy highlights the media's bias on the issue and the impact of the Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise. Alabama's GOP legislators have deliberately passed an unconstitutional law, hoping the conservative majority on the Supreme Court will overthrow Roe v. Wade. Conversely, New York's Democratic lawmakers aimed to create an abortion "sanctuary" in a post-Roe era. The underlying political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but both parties are influenced by activists and donors, leading to increasingly polarized and polarizing discourse dominated by extremes.
