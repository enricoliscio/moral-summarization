SUMMARY:

The abortion debate in the US is polarized, with both extremes pushing their agendas. President Trump accused Democrats of "pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth," which is a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks. Northam explained that in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered and kept comfortable, and then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. However, Democratic lawmakers in liberal states like New York and Virginia have introduced legislation to loosen abortion laws, allowing late-term abortions of viable babies solely if the mother's mental or emotional health was threatened. On the other hand, Alabama's near-total abortion ban is also seen as extreme. The media's reaction to these laws reveals their bias, with many Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The Roe v. Wade decision is seen as a "heavy-handed judicial intervention" that has galvanized the pro-life movement and caused both sides to take more absolutist positions. END OF SUMMARY.
