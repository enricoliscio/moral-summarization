SUMMARY: The article discusses the recent abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama and how they reflect the extreme positions of both Democrats and Republicans, respectively. It highlights how the media and political landscape have reacted differently to these laws, with more scrutiny placed on Alabama's near-total abortion ban. The article also explores the impact of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. Alabama's GOP legislators aim to challenge Roe v. Wade with their unconstitutional law, while New York's Democratic lawmakers seek to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The author argues that the underlying political reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties prioritize activists and donors, resulting in more polarized and extreme positions.
