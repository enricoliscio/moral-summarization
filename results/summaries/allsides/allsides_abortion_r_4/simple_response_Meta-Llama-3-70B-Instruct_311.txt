SUMMARY:

The article argues that both the New York and Alabama abortion laws are extreme and do not reflect the attitudes of the American people. President Trump's statement about late-term abortions is a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, which were taken out of context. The article highlights that most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's reaction to the Alabama law, but not the New York law, reveals a bias in the press. The article suggests that the Roe v. Wade decision has led to a polarized debate, with both pro-choice and pro-life activists taking more extreme positions. The Alabama law is unconstitutional, but its sponsors hope the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. The article concludes that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are more responsive to activists and donors, leading to a polarized and extreme debate.
