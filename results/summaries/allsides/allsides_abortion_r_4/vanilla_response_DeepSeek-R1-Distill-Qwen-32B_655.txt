Alright, I need to summarize this article about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning protests against Alabama's new abortion law. It then quotes President Trump talking about late-term abortions, calling it extreme. The author points out that while Trump's statements are exaggerated, they're based on something Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said. Northam discussed allowing late-term abortions if the fetus wasn't viable, but Tran's bill in Virginia was more about mental health threats, which didn't pass.

The article contrasts this with New York's law, which also expanded abortion access. It notes that both laws are seen as extreme by the American public, with most supporting early-stage abortions but opposing them in later stages. Polls show about 60% support in the first trimester versus 13% in the third.

The piece also discusses the media's reaction, pointing out that they were less critical of New York's law but focused more on Alabama's. It brings up the Roe v. Wade decision, which the author argues led to extreme positions on both sides. Alabama's law is unconstitutional under current rulings, but they're hoping the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. New York, on the other hand, is preparing for a post-Roe scenario.

The article concludes that both parties are catering to their bases, leading to polarization. It suggests that overturning Roe might not solve the political divide but could shift the debate to state levels.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the laws in Alabama and New York, public opinion, media bias, Roe v. Wade's impact, and the political strategies of each party. I should make sure to mention that both laws are extreme, the public's moderate stance, the media's focus on Alabama, and the potential consequences of overturning Roe.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme nature of Alabama's near-total abortion ban and New York's expanded abortion access, both seen as extreme by most Americans. President Trump criticized late-term abortions, referencing Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's comments, though Northam never endorsed infanticide. New York's law allows abortions up to birth, while Alabama's seeks to challenge Roe v. Wade. Public opinion shows support for early-stage abortions but opposition to late-term ones. Media focus on Alabama highlights the political divide, with Democrats and Republicans framing each other as extreme. Roe v. Wade has polarized the issue, with Alabama hoping to overturn it, while New York prepares for a post-Roe scenario. The article suggests that both parties prioritize activist bases over compromise, fueling polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
