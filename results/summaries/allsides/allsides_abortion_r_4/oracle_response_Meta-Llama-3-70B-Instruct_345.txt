SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Alabama's new abortion law is fueled by extreme views on both sides. President Trump's claim that Democrats are "pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth" is a "distortion and exaggeration" of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks. Northam explained that in cases where a fetus is not viable, the infant would be delivered and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. However, Democratic legislation in Virginia and New York would have allowed late-term abortions of viable babies solely if the mother's mental or emotional health was threatened. The media's differing reactions to these laws reveal a bias towards pro-choice views. The legal and political landscape is also skewed, with the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision imposing a permissive abortion regime and foreclosing state-level compromise. This has led to a polarized debate dominated by extremes, with both parties seeking to cast the other as extreme. A compromise is needed, but the parties are more responsive to activists and donors.
