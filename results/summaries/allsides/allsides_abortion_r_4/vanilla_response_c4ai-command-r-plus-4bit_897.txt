SUMMARY: The article discusses the recent abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama, and how they represent extreme positions on the issue. It highlights the comments made by President Trump and Virginia governor Ralph Northam, which have fueled the debate and been subject to fact-checking and interpretation. The article also explores the impact of the Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions from both sides of the debate. Alabama's recent near-total abortion ban aims to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York's law seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The underlying political reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are influenced by activists and donors, leading to more polarized and polarizing discourse. The debate is dominated by extremes, and the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on the political passion surrounding abortion remains uncertain.
