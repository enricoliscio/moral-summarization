SUMMARY: There is a moral panic regarding abortion laws, with both the New York and Alabama laws being considered extreme according to American attitudes. President Trump has accused Democrats of pushing for late-term abortions, even until the moment of birth, which has been labeled as a distortion and an exaggeration by fact-checkers. This follows comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam and Democratic delegate Kathy Tran, who introduced legislation to liberalize abortion, including during labor. While Northam's comments did not mention "executing" babies, Tran's bill would have allowed late-term abortions of viable babies if the mother's mental health was at risk. The media has reacted differently to the New York and Alabama laws, with the former receiving less attention, which reflects the legal and political landscape. The Alabama law is deliberately unconstitutional, aiming to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. Roe v. Wade has been criticized for imposing a permissive abortion regime and foreclosing state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions. The abortion debate remains polarized, with both parties seeking to cast the other as extreme, and the public desires a compromise.
END OF SUMMARY.
