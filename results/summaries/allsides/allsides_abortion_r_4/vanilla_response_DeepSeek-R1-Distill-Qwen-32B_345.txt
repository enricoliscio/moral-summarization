Okay, I need to summarize this article about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York. The article talks about how both laws are seen as extreme by the American people. President Trump criticized the New York law, calling it extreme, while Democrats argue it's a distortion. The article mentions how Tran's bill in Virginia would allow late-term abortions, which caused controversy. It also discusses the political strategies behind these laws, with Alabama trying to challenge Roe v. Wade and New York preparing for a possible reversal. The author points out that public opinion is conflicted, with support for early abortions but opposition as the pregnancy progresses. The article also reflects on how Roe v. Wade has polarized the issue, making compromise difficult. The conclusion is that both sides are using extreme positions, and the media's reaction highlights their biases. The summary should capture these points concisely, within 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme nature of Alabama's near-total abortion ban and New York's liberal abortion laws, as perceived by the American public. President Trump criticized New York's law, calling it extreme, while Democrats argue his claims are exaggerated. The article traces the controversy back to Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's bill, which would have allowed late-term abortions, and Governor Ralph Northam's comments supporting it. Both laws reflect broader political strategies: Alabama aims to challenge Roe v. Wade with its unconstitutional law, while New York prepares for a potential reversal of Roe. Public opinion on abortion is conflicted, with most supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The article highlights how Roe v. Wade has polarized the issue, making compromise difficult, and suggests that overturning it could shift the debate to state-level laws reflecting majority opinion. The media's differing reactions to the laws reveal biases, while the political landscape remains divided. END OF SUMMARY.
