SUMMARY:
The recent abortion laws in New York and Alabama have sparked controversy and protests, with both laws being considered extreme according to American attitudes. President Trump and other Republicans have criticized the laws as promoting late-term abortions, even up to the moment of birth, which has been labeled as a demagogic lie and distortion by Democrats and fact-checkers. The focus on rare and extreme cases, such as late-term abortions and impregnated 12-year-olds, has created a polarized and polarizing dynamic in the abortion debate. The media's reaction to the New York and Alabama laws highlights their stance on the issue, with the Alabama law being blatantly unconstitutional and the New York law creating an abortion "sanctuary". The current legal landscape, shaped by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, has resulted in a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. The pro-life movement has recently split between incrementalists and those who support a total ban on abortions. The underlying political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise on abortion, but the parties are driven by activists and donors, resulting in a continued emphasis on extreme cases. The question remains whether overturning Roe v. Wade would defuse the political passion surrounding abortion or simply shift the dynamic of the debate.
