SUMMARY:

The article discusses the recent abortion laws in New York and Alabama, highlighting the extreme stances of both sides. President Trump has been referencing Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, which were distorted and exaggerated to claim that Democrats support "executing" babies. In reality, Northam explained how non-viable fetuses would be delivered and kept comfortable, with discussions between the physician and mother. The article notes that polling on abortion is complex, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The media's reaction to the laws also reveals a bias, with more outrage over Alabama's ban than New York's liberalization. The article argues that the Roe v. Wade decision has polarized the debate, leading to absolutist positions and a lack of compromise. Ultimately, the article suggests that overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might be the only way to defuse the political passion surrounding the issue.
