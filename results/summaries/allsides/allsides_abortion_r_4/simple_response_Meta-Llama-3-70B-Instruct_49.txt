SUMMARY:

The article argues that both the New York and Alabama abortion laws are extreme and do not reflect the attitudes of the American people. President Trump's statement about late-term abortions is a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, which explained the process of delivering a non-viable fetus and discussing options with the mother. The article notes that polling on abortion is fraught, but generally, most Americans support early-stage abortions and opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's differing reactions to the New York and Alabama laws reveal a bias towards abortion rights. The article suggests that the Roe v. Wade decision has led to a polarized debate, with both pro-choice and pro-life activists taking more extreme positions. Overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might help to find a compromise. However, the current political landscape is driven by activists and donors, leading to a focus on extreme cases rather than finding a middle ground.
