Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about abortion laws in Alabama and New York, and the moral stances taken by different parties. I'll start by reading through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "extreme," "aggressively," "rip," "execution," "distortion," "exaggeration," "liberalize," "viable," "emotional health," "frenzy," "extreme," "conflicted," "permissive," "absolutist," "extremism," "compromise," "activists," "donors," "extreme," "polarized," "passion," "majority opinion." I think these words are key because they reflect the moral judgments in the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should capture the main points: the extreme laws in Alabama and New York, the political and moral arguments, the public's conflicted views, and the impact of Roe v. Wade. I should ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit.

I'll start by mentioning the extreme laws, then touch on the moral framing from both sides, the public's conflicted stance, the role of Roe v. Wade in polarization, and the call for compromise. I'll make sure to include as many of the identified words as possible without making the summary too clunky.

Let me piece this together. The article discusses how both Alabama and New York have extreme abortion laws, with Alabama banning nearly all abortions and New York allowing late-term ones. The moral framing is evident in the arguments against each law, with terms like "aggressively pushing" and "execution" used to describe the pro-choice side, and "extreme" used for both. Public opinion is conflicted, with most supporting early abortions but opposing late ones. The article also critiques Roe v. Wade for creating a polarized debate, with each side taking absolutist positions. The author suggests that overturning Roe might allow states to reflect majority opinions, but the political passion remains high, and compromise is needed.

I think that covers the main points and includes the morally framed words. Now, I'll structure this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.
