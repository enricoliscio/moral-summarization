Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about abortion laws in Alabama and New York. President Trump is quoted calling the New York law extreme, using terms like "aggressively pushing late-term abortion" and "ripped from their motherâ€™s womb." That's definitely moral framing with words like "extreme," "ripped," and "aggressively."

Then, the article mentions the media's reaction, labeling Trump's statements as demagogic lies. So "demagogic" and "lies" are moral terms here. Fact-checkers say it's a distortion and exaggeration, so "distortion" and "exaggeration" are also moral words.

Looking at Tran's legislation, it's described as "liberalizing abortion laws," which is a moral stance. Northam's explanation uses "viable," "resuscitated," and "discussions," but those are more factual. However, the article refers to "executing" babies, which is a strong moral term, even though Northam didn't say that.

The article then contrasts the media's reactions to New York and Alabama laws, using "yawned" and "frenzy," which show moral judgment on media bias. It also mentions that both laws are extreme, so "extreme" is repeated.

Gallup polling shows public support, but the article says the media's reaction shows where the press stands, using "frenzy" again. The legal and political landscape is discussed, with mentions of Roe v. Wade as a "heavy-handed" intervention, which is a moral critique.

The article also talks about the split in the pro-life movement between incrementalists and those going "all in," using "extremism" and "extreme" to describe both sides. The conclusion is that the debate is polarized, and overturning Roe might not defuse passion but could lead to compromise.

So, compiling all the morally framed words: extreme, aggressive, ripped, demagogic, lies, distortion, exaggeration, liberalizing, viable, resuscitated, executing, extreme, frenzy, heavy-handed, extremism, all in, polarized, passion, compromise.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it by discussing both laws, the moral framing from Trump and the media, the public opinion, and the legal implications, ending with the polarization and possible outcomes.

**SUMMARY:**

The article examines the moral and political implications of recent abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the extreme stances taken by both sides. President Trump criticized New York's law, calling it extreme and describing late-term abortions as ripping babies from the womb, which was dismissed as a demagogic lie by Democrats and fact-checkers. Meanwhile, Alabama's near-total abortion ban, deemed unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, aims to challenge the Supreme Court's precedent. The article notes that both laws are extreme, with public opinion generally supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. Media bias is evident, with more focus on Alabama's law despite New York's similarly extreme measures. The Roe v. Wade decision is criticized for its heavy-handedness, leading to polarization. The pro-life movement is split between incrementalists and those pursuing extreme measures, while the political landscape remains polarized, with both parties casting each other as extreme. Overturning Roe could allow states to reflect majority opinion, potentially reducing polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
