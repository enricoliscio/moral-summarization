Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York, the reactions from different sides, and the political implications. The author is discussing how both extremes are being pushed by each party, with Democrats supporting late-term abortions and Republicans enacting strict bans. 

I notice the author uses words like "pushing," "allowing," "ripped," "execution," "lie," "distortion," "exaggeration," etc. These words carry strong moral connotations. I need to incorporate these into the summary without making it too long—under 200 words.

I should start by mentioning the protesters in Alabama and the context of the new law. Then, touch on Trump's statements about abortion, the media's reaction, and the distortion involved. Next, explain the legislation in New York and Alabama, highlighting the extremes from both sides. 

It's important to note the public's attitude, as the author mentions that most Americans support early abortions but oppose late ones. The media's bias is another point—how they reacted more to Alabama's law than New York's. 

Then, I should mention the Roe v. Wade decision and its impact on the polarization of the issue. The author suggests that the current laws are extremes, and the political parties are catering to their bases rather than seeking compromise. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral words. I'll structure it to cover the main events, the moral framing from both sides, and the implications of the laws and public opinion. 

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring I include the necessary moral terms and keep it under 200 words. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure it's within the limit. 

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary is clear and coherent, avoiding any unnecessary details that might exceed the word limit.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Alabama opposed a new abortion law, while President Trump criticized Democrats for "aggressively pushing" late-term abortions, describing it as "ripping" babies from their mothers. Media and Democrats labeled his claims as a "demagogic lie," though they acknowledged some "distortion" and "exaggeration." Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and Delegate Kathy Tran's abortion legislation, which would have allowed late-term abortions, sparked controversy. Tran later retracted her comments, but the debate highlighted extremes in both parties. New York's law liberalizing abortion drew less attention than Alabama's near-total ban, despite both being seen as extreme by most Americans. Polls show majority support for early-stage abortions but opposition to late-term ones. The author critiques Roe v. Wade for creating polarization, allowing "pro-choice extremism" while banning "pro-life extremism." Alabama's law, likely unconstitutional, aims to challenge Roe, while New York's seeks to create a "sanctuary" for abortion rights. The political divide reflects activists' influence, with each party casting the other as extreme. The author suggests that overturning Roe could reduce polarization but notes the movement's split between incrementalists and radicals. The debate remains dominated by extremes, with both sides "highlighting" rare cases to sway public opinion. END OF SUMMARY.
