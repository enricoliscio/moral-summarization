SUMMARY:

The article discusses the controversy surrounding abortion laws in the US, specifically the recent laws passed in New York and Alabama. President Trump has been criticized for his remarks on late-term abortions, which fact-checkers have deemed a distortion and exaggeration. The article explains that Trump's comments are based on a misrepresentation of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks on a bill that would have allowed late-term abortions in certain cases. The article also notes that polling on abortion is complex, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The article argues that the current legal and political landscape, shaped by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, has led to a polarized debate dominated by extremes, and that overturning Roe could potentially lead to a more nuanced discussion.
