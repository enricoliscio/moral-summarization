SUMMARY:
The article discusses the recent abortion laws in New York and Alabama, framing them as extreme and highlighting the moral attitudes of the American people. President Trump's remarks on late-term abortion are deemed a demagogic lie, distorting Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's comments on a proposed bill. The article argues that both laws are extreme, with New York's law allowing late-term abortions for mental health reasons and Alabama's law banning nearly all abortions. The author suggests that the media's differing reactions to the two laws reveal their bias on the issue. The article concludes that the Roe v. Wade decision has created a polarized dynamic, where the debate is dominated by extremes, and that overturning Roe might allow for more nuanced, state-level compromises. END OF SUMMARY.
