SUMMARY: The recent abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama have sparked controversy and protests, with both laws being considered extreme by the American people. President Trump and other conservative figures have criticized the laws, with Trump claiming that Democrats are promoting late-term abortions, even up to the moment of birth. While this claim has been deemed a distortion and exaggeration by fact-checkers, it is partially based on comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam and a proposed bill by Democratic delegate Kathy Tran. The bill, which did not pass, would have allowed late-term abortions in certain cases, including viable, non-deformed babies if the mother's mental or emotional health was at risk. In contrast, Alabama's law imposes a near-total abortion ban, which is clearly unconstitutional under current precedent. The different approaches taken by New York and Alabama highlight the polarization and extremism that has characterized the abortion debate in the United States, with the media and political parties often focusing on extreme cases to cast the other side as extreme. This dynamic was created by the Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. The current political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise on abortion, but the parties are driven by activists and donors, resulting in increasingly polarized rhetoric and legislation.
