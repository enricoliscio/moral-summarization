Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the protests against Alabama's new abortion law. It mentions President Trump's comments on late-term abortions, which some call demagogic lies. It also discusses the New York law that allows late-term abortions if the mother's mental health is at risk. The author points out that both laws are seen as extreme by many Americans.

The article references a Virginia bill that didn't pass, where a delegate, Kathy Tran, suggested allowing abortions up to the 40th week, which she later corrected. Governor Northam supported this, explaining the medical process but not mentioning execution. The author notes that while Tran's bill didn't pass, it's part of a trend in liberal states to expand abortion rights.

The media's reaction is mentioned: they were more focused on Alabama's law than New York's. The article also brings up Justice Ginsburg's criticism of Roe v. Wade, suggesting it was too broad and caused polarization. Alabama's law is unconstitutional under current rulings, but they hope the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. New York, on the other hand, is preparing for a post-Roe scenario.

The author argues that Roe v. Wade allowed extreme pro-choice policies but not pro-life ones, leading to polarization. The parties are catering to their bases instead of seeking compromise, making the issue more extreme on both sides. The conclusion is that overturning Roe might not solve the political divide but could eventually lead to more state-level compromises.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I should focus on the key points: the extreme laws in Alabama and New York, the media's differing reactions, the historical context with Roe v. Wade, and the polarization it caused. Also, mention the potential for state-level solutions if Roe is overturned.

Let me structure it: start with the protests and Trump's comments, then the context of New York and Alabama laws, the media's bias, the legal context with Roe, and the implications for the future. Keep it concise and make sure each sentence adds value without being redundant.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme stances on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the polarization in American politics. Alabama’s near-total abortion ban and New York’s law allowing late-term abortions both reflect extremes, with public opinion generally favoring compromise. President Trump criticized late-term abortions, while Democrats dismissed his claims as misleading. Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran’s bill to legalize late-term abortions, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, sparked controversy but didn’t pass. The media’s focus on Alabama’s law over New York’s highlights a bias, while Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized Roe v. Wade for fostering polarization. Alabama’s law is unconstitutional under current precedent, but its supporters hope to overturn Roe. New York’s law aims to create a "sanctuary" for abortion rights if Roe is overturned. The article argues that Roe v. Wade allowed extreme pro-choice policies but not pro-life ones, leading to a divided debate. Overturning Roe might not resolve the issue but could allow states to reflect majority opinions. The political reality is that both parties cater to activists, rejecting compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
