SUMMARY: Recent legislative developments in Alabama and New York have brought the issue of abortion to the forefront of political discourse in the United States once again. While Alabama has passed a near-total abortion ban, New York has loosened its abortion laws even further, allowing abortions up until the 40th week of pregnancy. These laws are both considered extreme when compared to the attitudes of the American people, who generally support early-stage abortions but show increasing opposition as the fetus develops. The media's disparate treatment of these laws, with more scrutiny placed on Alabama's ban, reveals their bias on the issue. 

The current debate also highlights the polarized dynamic created by the Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed the possibility of state-level compromise. This has led to more absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. The Alabama law is deliberately unconstitutional, aiming to provoke the conservative majority in the Supreme Court to overthrow Roe v. Wade. Conversely, New York's law seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" in a post-Roe scenario. 

Ultimately, the underlying political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise on abortion, but their voices are often drowned out by the more vocal and financially influential activists and donors within the parties.
