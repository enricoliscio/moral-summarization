Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the extreme abortion laws in Alabama and New York, with President Trump criticizing Democrats for allowing late-term abortions. The author mentions that Trump's statements are distortions but based on actual legislation. They reference Virginia's bill, where Tran suggested allowing abortions up to 40 weeks, and Northam's comments about delivering non-viable infants. The author points out that while Tran's bill didn't pass, it's part of a trend in liberal states to expand abortion laws.

The article then contrasts this with Alabama's near-total ban, which is unconstitutional under current law. The author argues that both extremes are problematic because they don't reflect the majority's moderate stance. Polls show most Americans support early abortions but oppose late-term ones. The media's focus on Alabama over New York highlights their bias, the author says.

The Roe v. Wade decision is criticized for being too broad, leading to polarization. The author suggests that overturning Roe might allow states to pass more moderate laws, reflecting public opinion better. They also mention the split in the pro-life movement between incrementalists and those pushing for extreme measures, which might not be the best strategy.

So, the summary needs to capture these points: the extreme laws in both states, the media bias, the public's moderate stance, the impact of Roe v. Wade, and the potential for compromise if Roe is overturned.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and maintains the moral framing, which seems to be about the extremism on both sides and the need for compromise. I should avoid taking sides but present the author's perspective that both extremes are problematic and that the current legal framework exacerbates polarization.

Let me structure the summary: start with the extreme laws, mention the media's selective coverage, discuss public opinion, the role of Roe v. Wade, and conclude with the potential for compromise if the law changes.

I need to ensure it's clear and flows well, sticking to the key points without getting bogged down in details. Also, make sure to include the author's critique of both parties and the media's bias.

The article discusses the extreme abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the moral and political polarization surrounding the issue. President Trump criticized Democrats for supporting late-term abortions, referencing distorted claims about legislation in Virginia. While these claims were exaggerated, they were based on actual bills, such as Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's proposal to allow abortions up to 40 weeks, which did not pass. The author notes that both states' laws reflect extreme positions, with Alabama's near-total ban being unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, while New York's law permits late-term abortions. The media's focus on Alabama over New York reflects a bias, as both laws are extreme but only one garners attention. Public opinion generally supports early-stage abortions but opposes late-term ones, with most Americans wanting a compromise. The author critiques Roe v. Wade for creating polarization, allowing pro-choice extremes while banning pro-life measures.

The article concludes that both parties are responsive to activists, leading to extreme positions, while the majority seeks moderation.
