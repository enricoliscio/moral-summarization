SUMMARY: The debate over abortion laws in the United States has intensified in recent months, with extreme measures being proposed and passed in both liberal and conservative states. While the American people generally support early-stage abortions, they are opposed to late-term abortions. The media has largely ignored New York's liberal abortion law while remaining fixated on Alabama's near-total abortion ban. This discrepancy highlights the media's bias on the issue. The current polarization of the abortion debate can be traced back to the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and prevented state-level compromise. Today, both the pro-choice and pro-life movements are taking increasingly absolutist positions, with little room for compromise. The underlying political reality is that most Americans want a middle ground, but the parties are driven by activists and donors, resulting in more extreme positions being put forward. The debate is now dominated by rare and extreme cases, with late-term abortions and impregnated pre-teens being used as political ammunition. The consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade are uncertain, but it may allow for a more nuanced debate that reflects the complex views of the American people.
