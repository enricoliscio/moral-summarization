SUMMARY:
The Alabama abortion law has sparked controversy, with President Trump accusing Democrats of promoting "late-term abortion" and "executing" babies. However, fact-checkers have deemed this a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks. Northam had explained that in cases where a fetus is not viable, the infant would be delivered and kept comfortable, and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. Meanwhile, liberal states like New York have passed laws allowing late-term abortions, which are seen as extreme by many Americans. The debate is polarized, with Republicans highlighting rare late-term abortions and Democrats focusing on rare cases of rape. The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has been criticized for being a "heavy-handed judicial intervention" that has galvanized the pro-life movement and led to absolutist positions. END OF SUMMARY.
