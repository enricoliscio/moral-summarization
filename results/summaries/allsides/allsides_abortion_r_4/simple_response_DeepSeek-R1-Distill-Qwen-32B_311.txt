Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author presented. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article discusses the extreme stances on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the moral divide. President Trump criticized New York's law, calling it extreme, while Democrats argue it's about choice. The author points out that both laws are seen as extreme by the majority of Americans, referencing polling data where most support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term ones.

The article also delves into the political and legal context, mentioning the impact of the Roe v. Wade decision. It explains how Roe led to a polarized debate, with both sides taking absolutist positions. The author suggests that overturning Roe could allow states to reflect more moderate public opinions, potentially reducing the intensity of the debate.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the moral extremes, the political strategies, and the implications of Roe v. Wade. I'll ensure the summary reflects the author's framing, emphasizing the polarization and the potential for change if Roe is overturned.

Let me structure the summary: start with the extreme laws in Alabama and New York, mention public opinion, discuss the political strategies, reference Roe v. Wade's role in polarization, and conclude with the potential impact of overturning Roe. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article examines the moral and political extremes in the abortion debate, highlighting the contrasting laws in Alabama and New York. Alabama's near-total abortion ban is seen as extreme by many, while New York's law allowing late-term abortions has also drawn criticism. President Trump and Democrats clash over these policies, with Trump accusing Democrats of promoting extreme abortion practices. The author notes that both laws are outliers compared to public opinion, where most Americans support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term ones. The article traces the polarization to the Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and stifled state-level compromise, leading to absolutist positions from both sides. The author suggests that overturning Roe could allow states to reflect more moderate public attitudes, potentially reducing polarization. However, the current political climate, driven by activists and donors, keeps the parties at odds, with each framing the other as extreme. END OF SUMMARY.
