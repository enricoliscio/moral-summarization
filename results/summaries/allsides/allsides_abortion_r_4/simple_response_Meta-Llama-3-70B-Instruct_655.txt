SUMMARY:

The article argues that both the New York and Alabama abortion laws are extreme and do not reflect the attitudes of the American people. While President Trump's statement about late-term abortions is a distortion, it is based on a real controversy in Virginia where a Democratic delegate introduced a bill to liberalize abortion laws. The bill would have allowed late-term abortions of viable babies solely if the mother's mental or emotional health was threatened. The article suggests that the media's differing reactions to the New York and Alabama laws reveal a bias in favor of abortion rights. The legal and political landscape, shaped by the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, has led to a polarized debate dominated by extremes. The article concludes that overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might not defuse the political passion, but could be a step towards a more nuanced discussion.
