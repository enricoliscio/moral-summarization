Alright, I need to summarize this article about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York. The user wants a concise summary, so I'll have to pick out the main points. 

First, the article talks about protests against Alabama's new abortion law. It mentions President Trump's comments on late-term abortions, which some call demagogic. I should note that both laws are seen as extreme by many Americans.

The article also discusses the context with Virginia's legislation and Governor Northam's statements. It's important to explain how Tran's bill allowed late-term abortions for mental health reasons, even though it didn't pass. 

Then, it contrasts this with Alabama's near-total ban, which is unconstitutional under current law. The summary should include that both sides are trying to push their agendas, with Democrats focusing on late-term abortions and Republicans on strict bans.

I should also mention the public's conflicted views on abortion, with support decreasing as the trimester progresses. The article criticizes the media for focusing more on Alabama's law than New York's, highlighting the political and legal landscape.

Finally, the article points out that Roe v. Wade has led to polarization, and overturning it might allow states to reflect majority opinions, but it's unclear if that will reduce political tensions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to cover these points succinctly, ensuring it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the polarized debate over abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the extremes on both sides. President Trump criticized Democrats for supporting late-term abortions, referencing Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's bill, which would have allowed abortions up to the 40th week of pregnancy. While Tran's bill didn't pass, it reflects a trend in liberal states to expand abortion access. Meanwhile, Alabama's near-total abortion ban is seen as extreme by many, as it deliberately challenges the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade. The article notes that public opinion on abortion is conflicted, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The media's focus on Alabama's law over New York's highlights the political and legal divide. The author argues that Roe v. Wade has fueled polarization, with both sides adopting absolutist positions, and suggests that overturning Roe might allow states to reflect broader public attitudes but may not resolve the political conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
