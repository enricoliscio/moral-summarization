SUMMARY:

The article argues that both the New York and Alabama abortion laws are extreme and do not reflect the attitudes of the American people. President Trump's statement about late-term abortion is a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, but it highlights the trend of liberal states loosening abortion laws. The article notes that most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's differing reactions to the New York and Alabama laws reveal their bias on the issue. The article suggests that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has led to a polarized debate, with both pro-choice and pro-life activists taking more absolutist positions. The Alabama law is unconstitutional, but its passage aims to challenge Roe v. Wade. The article concludes that overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might not defuse the political passion, but it could be a step towards finding a compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
