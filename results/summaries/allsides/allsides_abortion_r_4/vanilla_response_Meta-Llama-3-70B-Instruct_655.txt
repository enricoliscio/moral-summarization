SUMMARY:

The article discusses the recent abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama, which are seen as extreme by the American public. President Trump has been referencing Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks on late-term abortions, which were distorted and exaggerated. Northam's original statement explained how in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered and kept comfortable, and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. The article highlights that most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's reaction to the laws also reveals a bias, with more outrage over Alabama's near-total ban than New York's liberalization of abortion laws. The article suggests that the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has polarized the abortion debate, and that overturning Roe could allow for state-level compromise and a more nuanced discussion.

END OF SUMMARY.
