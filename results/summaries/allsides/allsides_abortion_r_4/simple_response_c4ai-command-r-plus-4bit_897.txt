SUMMARY: The abortion debate in the United States has recently been marked by extreme measures taken by both liberal and conservative states. While the Alabama State Legislature has passed a near-total abortion ban, New York has legalized abortions until the 40th week of pregnancy. These laws are at odds with the attitudes of most Americans, who generally support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term abortions. The media's reaction to these laws also highlights its bias on the issue, with more coverage of the Alabama law than the New York law. The current polarization of the abortion debate can be traced back to the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and prevented state-level compromise. The Alabama law is deliberately unconstitutional, aiming to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York's law seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" in a post-Roe era. The current political landscape is dominated by activist and donor interests, with both parties moving away from compromise and towards more absolutist positions.

END OF SUMMARY.
