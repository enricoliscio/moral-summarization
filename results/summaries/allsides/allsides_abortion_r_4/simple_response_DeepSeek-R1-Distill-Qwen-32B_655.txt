Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about the abortion laws in Alabama and New York, along with some context on the political and public reactions. My task is to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It discusses how both Alabama and New York have passed extreme abortion laws, with Alabama banning almost all abortions and New York allowing late-term ones. The author mentions President Trump's comments on these laws, highlighting the moral conflict. There's also a reference to Virginia's situation with Governor Northam and Delegate Tran, which adds to the debate on late-term abortions.

The article then delves into public opinion, noting that most Americans support early-stage abortions but oppose them in the third trimester. It criticizes the media for focusing more on Alabama's law than New York's, suggesting a bias. The piece also touches on the legal implications, referencing the Roe v. Wade decision and how it's influenced the current polarized debate. The author argues that the Supreme Court's ruling led to extreme positions from both sides, making compromise difficult.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. The key elements are the extreme laws in Alabama and New York, the public's conflicted stance, media bias, the impact of Roe v. Wade, and the call for a more moderate approach. I should ensure the moral aspects are clear, such as the extremes on both sides and the public's desire for compromise.

I'll start by mentioning the extreme laws and the moral conflict. Then, I'll note the public opinion data and media bias. Next, I'll touch on the legal context with Roe v. Wade and the resulting polarization. Finally, I'll conclude with the need for compromise and the parties' focus on extremes.

I should be concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without going into too much detail. Also, I need to preserve the author's framing, which seems to suggest that both sides are extreme and that the system is polarized, leading to a lack of compromise.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring it flows logically from one point to the next. I'll make sure to highlight the moral conflict, public opinion, media bias, legal context, and the call for compromise.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political conflict surrounding abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting extreme positions on both sides. Alabama’s near-total abortion ban and New York’s liberalized abortion laws reflect opposing views, with President Trump and pro-life advocates criticizing late-term abortions, while pro-choice supporters defend reproductive rights. Public opinion is conflicted, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The media’s focus on Alabama’s law over New York’s highlights a perceived bias. The article critiques the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision for creating a polarized debate, allowing extreme positions and discouraging compromise. Both parties exploit the issue to cast the other as extreme, with Democrats emphasizing late-term abortions and Republicans focusing on rare cases like child rape victims. The author argues that overturning Roe could shift power to states but warns against the risks of extreme measures. The underlying reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the political system prioritizes activist and donor interests over moderation. END OF SUMMARY.
