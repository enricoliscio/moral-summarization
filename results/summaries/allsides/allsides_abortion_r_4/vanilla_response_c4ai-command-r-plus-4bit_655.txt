SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama and how they reflect the polarized and polarizing nature of the abortion debate in the United States. While the New York law allows late-term abortions, the Alabama law imposes a near-total ban. The author argues that the media's response to these laws reflects its bias on the issue, with more criticism directed at Alabama's law. The article also explores how the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision contributed to this polarization by imposing a permissive abortion regime and foreclosing state-level compromise. The Alabama law is intended to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The author concludes that most Americans want a compromise, but the political parties are driven by activists and donors, resulting in more extreme positions.
