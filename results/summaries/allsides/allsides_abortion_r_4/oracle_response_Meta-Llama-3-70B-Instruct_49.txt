SUMMARY:

The article highlights the moral extremism on both sides of the abortion debate, citing President Trump's "demagogic lie" about late-term abortions and Democrats' push for liberalized abortion laws. In reality, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks were distorted and exaggerated by Trump, who referenced them to criticize Democrats. Northam's original statement explained how, in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered and kept comfortable, and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. The article argues that both the New York and Alabama laws are extreme, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The media's differing reactions to the two laws reveal their bias on the issue. The author suggests that Roe v. Wade's "heavy-handed judicial intervention" has polarized the debate, allowing pro-choice extremism but not pro-life extremism, and that overturning Roe might lead to a more nuanced compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
