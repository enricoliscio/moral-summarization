SUMMARY:
President Trump's recent remarks on late-term abortion have been deemed a "demagogic lie" by many. However, they are rooted in a distortion of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's comments on a proposed bill that would have allowed late-term abortions of viable babies if the mother's mental or emotional health was threatened. This is part of a trend in liberal states to loosen abortion laws, which many Americans find "extreme." Meanwhile, Alabama's near-total abortion ban is also seen as "extreme" and unconstitutional. The debate is dominated by the extremes, with Republicans highlighting rare late-term abortions and Democrats focusing on rare cases of rape. The Roe v. Wade decision has created a polarized dynamic, and overturning it might not defuse the political passion, but could lead to a more nuanced discussion. END OF SUMMARY.
