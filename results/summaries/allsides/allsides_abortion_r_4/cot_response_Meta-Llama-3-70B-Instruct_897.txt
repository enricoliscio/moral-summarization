SUMMARY:
The article discusses the recent abortion laws in New York and Alabama, highlighting the extreme views on both sides of the debate. President Trump's statement about late-term abortion was deemed a demagogic lie and distortion by fact-checkers. The article notes that while most Americans support early-stage abortions, opposition grows as the fetus develops. The Alabama law, which bans nearly all abortions, is seen as extreme, while the New York law, which allows late-term abortions, is also viewed as extreme. The article argues that the Roe v. Wade decision has created a polarized dynamic, where the debate is dominated by the extremes. Overturning Roe might not defuse the political passion, but it could lead to a more nuanced debate.
