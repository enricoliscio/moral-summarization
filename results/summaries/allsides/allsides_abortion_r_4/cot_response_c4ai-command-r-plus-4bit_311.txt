SUMMARY:
The recent abortion laws passed in Alabama and New York have sparked controversy and debate, with both laws being considered extreme by the American people. President Trump has criticized Democrats for promoting late-term abortion, while cable news and leading Democrats have accused him of distorting and exaggerating the truth. The discussion revolves around comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam and Democratic delegate Kathy Tran, who introduced legislation to liberalize abortion in their state. Tran's bill, which did not pass, would have allowed late-term abortions of viable, non-deformed babies if the mother's mental or emotional health was at risk. Meanwhile, Alabama's near-total abortion ban is clearly unconstitutional, but its GOP legislators aim to challenge Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. On the other hand, New York aims to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The current legal landscape, shaped by Roe v. Wade, permits pro-choice extremism while prohibiting pro-life extremism. This has forced the pro-life movement to adopt incremental strategies, but with the possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade, the movement is divided. The underlying political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but the parties prioritize the interests of activists and donors, resulting in polarized and polarizing discourse. The debate is dominated by extremes, with Republicans highlighting rare late-term abortions and Democrats focusing on rare cases of impregnated minors. The potential overturning of Roe v. Wade may not defuse political passions, but it could lead to state laws that better reflect majority opinions. END OF SUMMARY.
