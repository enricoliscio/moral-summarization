SUMMARY:
The recent abortion laws passed in Alabama and New York have been labeled as extreme by the American people. President Trump has accused Democrats of pushing for late-term abortions, even until the moment of birth, a claim that has been deemed a lie and a distortion by fact-checkers. The controversy surrounding these laws has brought to light the comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who supported legislation to liberalize abortion, including during labor. The media's reaction to the New York and Alabama laws reveals their stance on the issue, with the former receiving little attention compared to the frenzy over the latter. The current legal landscape, including the Roe v. Wade decision, has been criticized for imposing a permissive abortion regime and foreclosing state-level compromise, leading to more absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. Alabama's near-total abortion ban is intentionally unconstitutional, aiming to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York's law seeks to create an abortion "sanctuary" post-Roe. The Roe ruling enables pro-choice extremism while restricting pro-life extremism, leading to an incremental strategy by the pro-life movement. However, with the possibility of overturning Roe, the movement has split between incrementalists and those seeking a more drastic change. The political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but the parties are influenced by activists and donors, resulting in a shift in rhetoric. The abortion debate has become polarized, dominated by extremes, and it remains to be seen if overturning Roe would defuse the political passion surrounding it. END OF SUMMARY.
