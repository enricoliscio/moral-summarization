Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about protests against Alabama's new abortion law and compares it to New York's law. President Trump is mentioned criticizing Democrats for pushing late-term abortions, calling it extreme. The article then goes into details about what happened in Virginia with Governor Northam and Delegate Tran's bill, which allowed late-term abortions if the mother's mental health was threatened. It also mentions New York's law and how both states are seen as extreme by most Americans.

The article discusses public opinion, noting that most people support early abortions but oppose late ones. It points out that the media's reaction to these laws is biased, focusing more on Alabama than New York. It references the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which is seen as a moderate ruling but actually allows extreme pro-choice measures. The article suggests that both parties are catering to their activists rather than the majority, leading to polarization.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: the protests, Trump's criticism, the comparison between Alabama and New York laws, public opinion on abortion timing, media bias, the impact of Roe v. Wade, and the political polarization.

Let me structure it: start with the protests and the comparison of laws as extreme. Mention Trump's comments and the context with Virginia and New York. Highlight public support for early abortions, media's differing reactions. Discuss Roe v. Wade's role in polarization and the split in the pro-life movement. End with the political reality of parties catering to activists, leading to extreme positions.

I need to ensure it's concise and under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the extreme stances on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting public conflict and media bias. Protests against Alabama's near-total ban contrast with New York's expansion of abortion rights, both seen as extreme by most Americans. President Trump criticized Democrats for promoting late-term abortions, referencing Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's bill, which allowed abortions up to the 40th week. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam supported this, sparking controversy. New York's law, allowing abortions until birth, passed without much media attention, unlike Alabama's ban. Public opinion shows majority support for early abortions but opposition to late ones. The media's focus on Alabama highlights its bias. The article critiques Roe v. Wade for polarizing the issue, allowing extreme pro-choice measures while banning pro-life ones. This has led to political polarization, with parties catering to activists rather than the majority, fostering extreme positions. END OF SUMMARY.
