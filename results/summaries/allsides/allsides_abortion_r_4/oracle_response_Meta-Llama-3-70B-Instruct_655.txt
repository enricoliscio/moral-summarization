SUMMARY:

The article highlights the extreme stances on abortion laws in the US, citing the Alabama and New York laws as examples. President Trump's statement about Democrats "pushing" late-term abortions, allowing the "execution" of babies, is deemed a "distortion" and "exaggeration" by fact-checkers. The statement is based on Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, which were taken out of context. Northam's original statement explained the process of delivering a non-viable fetus and having a discussion with the mother about the infant's fate. The article argues that both the Alabama and New York laws are extreme, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The Roe v. Wade decision is seen as a "heavy-handed judicial intervention" that has polarized the debate, with each side seeking to cast the other as extreme. The article suggests that overturning Roe could lead to a more nuanced debate, with states passing laws that reflect majority opinion.

END OF SUMMARY.
