SUMMARY: President Trump accused Democrats of aggressively pushing late-term abortion laws, allowing babies to be 'ripped from their mother's womb' until birth. Cable news and leading Democrats call this a lie and a distortion, but it reflects the extreme positions taken by both parties on abortion. The New York law, which permits late-term abortions, and the Alabama law, which bans almost all abortions, are both seen as extreme by the American people. The media frenzy over Alabama's law and the lack of attention to New York's reveal the press's bias on the issue. The Roe v. Wade decision imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise, galvanizing both pro-choice and pro-life absolutist positions. Alabama's GOP legislators deliberately passed an unconstitutional law, hoping the conservative majority in the Supreme Court would overthrow Roe v. Wade. Democrats in New York created an abortion'sanctuary' in case Roe is reversed. The underlying reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but both parties are influenced by activists and donors, resulting in more extreme positions. The Roe decision created a polarized dynamic dominated by extremes, and it remains to be seen if overturning it would defuse political passion.
END OF SUMMARY.
