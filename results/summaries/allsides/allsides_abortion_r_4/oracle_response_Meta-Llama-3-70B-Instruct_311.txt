SUMMARY:

The article highlights the extreme views on abortion laws in the US, citing the Alabama and New York laws as examples. President Trump's statement about Democrats "pushing" late-term abortions and "allowing" the "execution" of babies is deemed a "lie" and "distortion" by fact-checkers. However, the article notes that Virginia governor Ralph Northam's remarks about delivering non-viable infants and discussing their fate with the mother were taken out of context. The article argues that both the Alabama and New York laws are extreme, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposing late-term ones. The media's differing reactions to the two laws reveal a bias towards the pro-choice stance. The article concludes that the polarized debate on abortion is a result of the Supreme Court's "heavy-handed" Roe v. Wade decision, which "imposed" a permissive abortion regime and "foreclosed" state-level compromise. Overturning Roe could lead to a more nuanced debate and compromise.

END OF SUMMARY.
