Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses the extreme stances on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, comparing them to public opinion. It mentions President Trump's comments about late-term abortions, which he claims Democrats are pushing. The author points out that while Trump's statements are exaggerated, they're based on real legislation, like Virginia's failed bill and New York's law. The article also touches on the media's reaction, suggesting bias, and the impact of Roe v. Wade on polarization.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should focus on the key points: the extreme laws, public opinion, media bias, and the legal impact. I'll make sure to use words like "pushing," "allowing," "extreme," "distortion," "legislation," "bans," "compromise," etc.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the contrast between the laws and public sentiment, mention the media's role, and the implications of Roe v. Wade. I'll keep it under 200 words and ensure it flows logically.

SUMMARY: The article examines the moral and political extremes of recent abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting the clash between public opinion and legislative actions. President Trump criticized Democrats for "pushing" late-term abortions, calling it "execution" of babies, a claim deemed a "distortion" and "exaggeration." This framing reflects the moral conflict over abortion rights. The article references Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's failed legislation, which would have allowed late-term abortions, and Governor Ralph Northam's defense, emphasizing the "violation" of infanticide laws. New York's law, allowing abortions up to birth, was met with less media scrutiny than Alabama's near-total ban, suggesting bias. The author argues that both laws are extreme, as most Americans support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term ones. The article critiques Roe v. Wade for creating a polarized landscape, where states like Alabama pass unconstitutional "bans" to challenge the Supreme Court, while New York aims to create a "sanctuary" for abortion rights. The moral framing underscores the "intervention," "imposed" policies, and "polarizing" debate, with both parties casting each other as "extreme." The author suggests that overturning Roe could allow states to reflect majority opinions, but the "dominated" extremes may persist. END OF SUMMARY.
