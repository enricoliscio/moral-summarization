SUMMARY: While the media has largely ignored New York's extreme abortion law, there has been a frenzy over Alabama's near-total abortion ban. Both laws are out of step with the attitudes of the American people, who generally support early-stage abortions but not late-term abortions. The media's biased reaction to these laws reveals its stance on the issue. The current legal landscape, shaped by Roe v. Wade, has prevented state-level compromise and encouraged absolutist positions from both pro-choice and pro-life movements. Alabama's GOP legislators have deliberately passed an unconstitutional law, hoping the conservative majority in the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, New York's Democratic lawmakers aim to create an abortion "sanctuary" in a post-Roe era. The reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but political parties are driven by activists and donors, pushing the debate towards extreme positions. The polarized dynamic, fueled by Roe v. Wade, may only be defused by overturning it and allowing states to pass laws reflecting majority opinion.
END OF SUMMARY.
