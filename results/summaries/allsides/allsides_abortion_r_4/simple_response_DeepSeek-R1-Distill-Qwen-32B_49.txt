Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses the recent abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting that both are seen as extreme by many Americans. It mentions President Trump's comments on late-term abortions, which were criticized as demagogic lies by Democrats and fact-checkers. The author points out that while Trump exaggerated, there's some basis in what Virginia Governor Ralph Northam said about late-term abortions, where the infant could be delivered and then a discussion held about whether to proceed with the abortion.

The article also notes that Tran's bill in Virginia, which would allow late-term abortions for mental health reasons, didn't pass, but it's part of a trend in liberal states to expand abortion rights. The author contrasts this with Alabama's near-total ban, which is unconstitutional under current law but aims to challenge Roe v. Wade.

The author criticizes the media for focusing more on Alabama's law than New York's, suggesting a bias. They also discuss the impact of Roe v. Wade, arguing it led to polarization by imposing a permissive regime and preventing state-level compromises. This has caused both sides to adopt extreme positions, with pro-life groups seeking to overturn Roe incrementally, while some states like Alabama are taking more drastic measures.

The conclusion is that most Americans want a compromise, but the political system is driven by activists and donors, leading to extreme positions from both parties. The author suggests that overturning Roe might not solve the polarization but could shift the debate.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. I should mention both states' laws, the media bias, the impact of Roe v. Wade, and the call for compromise. I'll make sure to highlight the extremes on both sides and the underlying desire for moderation among the public.

SUMMARY: The article examines the moral and political implications of recent abortion laws in Alabama and New York, arguing both are extreme in the eyes of many Americans. President Trump criticized late-term abortions, distorting comments by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, while Democrats dismissed his claims as lies. Tran's bill in Virginia, which would have allowed late-term abortions for mental health reasons, highlighted a trend in liberal states to expand abortion rights. Meanwhile, Alabama's near-total ban aims to challenge Roe v. Wade. The media's focus on Alabama over New York reflects bias, as both laws are extreme. Roe v. Wade polarized the issue, imposing a permissive regime and preventing state-level compromises, leading to absolutist positions. The author suggests most Americans seek compromise, but political parties cater to activists, amplifying extremes. Overturning Roe might not reduce polarization but could shift the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
