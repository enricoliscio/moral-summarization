SUMMARY: The article discusses the opposing abortion laws passed in Alabama and New York, which have sparked controversy and debate across the United States. While Alabama has passed a near-total abortion ban, New York has legalized abortions up to the 40th week of pregnancy. The author argues that both laws are extreme when compared to the attitudes of the American people, as most Americans support early-stage abortions but oppose late-term abortions. The article also highlights the political and legal landscape surrounding abortion, including the impact of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed a permissive abortion regime and foreclosed state-level compromise. The author suggests that the Roe decision has contributed to the polarization of the abortion debate, with both parties seeking to cast the other as extreme. The article concludes by suggesting that overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws reflecting majority opinion may not defuse political passion, but it is a path worth exploring.
