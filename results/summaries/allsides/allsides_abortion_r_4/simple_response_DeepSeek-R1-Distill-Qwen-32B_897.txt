Okay, so I need to help this user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first to understand the main points. The article talks about the extreme positions on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, and how both are seen as extreme by the American public. It mentions President Trump's statements and the reactions, including the context of Virginia's legislation and Governor Northam's comments. There's also a discussion about the media's reaction, the role of the Supreme Court, and the implications of Roe v. Wade. The article ends by suggesting that both sides are polarized and that overturning Roe might not solve the political divide.

Now, I need to create a summary that's under 200 words. I should focus on the key moral arguments presented. The user wants the moral framing preserved, so I need to highlight the extremes on both sides, the media's bias, and the impact of Roe v. Wade on polarization.

I should start by mentioning both Alabama and New York's laws being seen as extreme. Then, touch on Trump's statements and the context of Tran and Northam's comments. Next, explain the media's differing reactions and the underlying public support for moderate approaches. Then, discuss the legal implications with Roe v. Wade and how it's influenced the polarization. Finally, conclude with the potential for further division if Roe is overturned.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly. Also, I must avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The article examines the moral and political divide over abortion laws in Alabama and New York, highlighting how both states' extreme positions reflect broader societal conflicts. President Trump criticized New York's law, calling it extreme, while Democrats and media outlets accused him of distorting the issue. The article traces the controversy back to Virginia's abortion debate, where Democratic lawmakers proposed liberalizing abortion laws, including late-term abortions, sparking outrage. Alabama's near-total abortion ban is unconstitutional under current law but aims to challenge Roe v. Wade, while New York's law seeks to protect abortion rights in case Roe is overturned. The piece argues that Roe v. Wade has fueled polarization, allowing pro-choice extremes while blocking pro-life measures, leading to a split between incrementalists and radicals in the pro-life movement. Polling shows most Americans support moderate abortion policies, but political parties cater to activists, deepening the divide. The article suggests that overturning Roe might not resolve the conflict, as the debate remains dominated by extremes. END OF SUMMARY.
