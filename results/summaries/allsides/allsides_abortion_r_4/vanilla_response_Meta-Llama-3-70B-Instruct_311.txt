SUMMARY:

The article discusses the controversy surrounding abortion laws in the US, particularly in Alabama and New York. President Trump has been criticized for his exaggerated claims about late-term abortions, which are based on a misrepresentation of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks. While Trump's claims are a distortion, they highlight the trend of liberal states loosening abortion laws. The article notes that most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's differing reactions to Alabama's near-total abortion ban and New York's liberal law reveal a bias in the press. The article suggests that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has contributed to the polarization of the abortion debate, making it difficult to find a compromise. The Alabama law, which is clearly unconstitutional, is seen as a test of the Supreme Court's new conservative majority.
