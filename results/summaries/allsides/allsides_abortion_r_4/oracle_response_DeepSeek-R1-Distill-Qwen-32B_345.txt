Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the extreme stances on abortion laws in Alabama and New York, with President Trump criticizing Democrats for allowing late-term abortions. It mentions the use of morally charged terms like "pushing," "allowing," "execution," and "distortion." The author contrasts the media's reaction to New York's law versus Alabama's, highlighting the polarization created by Roe v. Wade.

I should start by identifying the key events: the Alabama abortion ban, President Trump's statements, the Virginia and New York legislation, and the media's differing reactions. I need to include terms like "pushing," "allowing," "execution," "distortion," "violate," "legislation," "bans," "compromise," and "polarizing."

Next, I'll structure the summary to cover the main points: the extreme laws, media bias, the impact of Roe v. Wade, and the split in the pro-life movement. I'll make sure to use the moral words to frame the narrative accurately.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all essential elements. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting the political strategies, media reactions, and the broader implications of Roe v. Wade on the abortion debate.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the moral framing and includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. The goal is a clear, concise summary that reflects the original article's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The article examines the moral and political polarization surrounding abortion laws in Alabama and New York. President Trump criticized Democrats for "pushing" late-term abortions, describing it as "ripping" babies from their mothers, a claim deemed a "distortion" and "exaggeration." Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran's bill, which would have allowed late-term abortions, sparked controversy, while Governor Ralph Northam clarified that infants would be "kept comfortable" after delivery. New York's law, allowing abortions up to birth, faced less media scrutiny than Alabama's near-total ban, highlighting a "polarizing" dynamic. The author argues that Roe v. Wade created an extreme legal landscape, with Democrats and Republicans "highlighting" rare cases to cast each other as "extreme." The media's "yawned" reaction to New York's law contrasts with the frenzy over Alabama's, reflecting a "polarizing" debate dominated by "extremes." The article suggests that overturning Roe could allow states to reflect "majority opinion," but the political divide remains unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
