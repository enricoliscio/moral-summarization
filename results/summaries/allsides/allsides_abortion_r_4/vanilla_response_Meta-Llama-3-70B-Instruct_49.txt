SUMMARY:

The article discusses the recent abortion laws in New York and Alabama, which are seen as extreme by the American public. President Trump has been referencing a distorted version of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's remarks, claiming that Democrats support "executing" babies. However, Northam's original statement explained how, in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered and kept comfortable, and then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. The article highlights that polling on abortion is complex, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposition growing as the fetus develops. The Alabama law is unconstitutional under current precedent, but was deliberately passed to challenge Roe v. Wade. The article concludes that the polarized debate on abortion is dominated by extremes, and that overturning Roe might not defuse the passion, but could allow states to pass laws reflecting majority opinion.

END OF SUMMARY.
