SUMMARY:
The recent abortion laws passed in New York and Alabama have sparked controversy and protests, with both being deemed extreme by the American people. President Trump has criticized the Democratic Party for promoting late-term abortions, even up to the moment of birth, while cable news and leading Democrats have accused him of lying and distorting the truth. The media's biased response to the laws in New York and Alabama reveals their stance on the issue. The current legal landscape, influenced by Roe v. Wade, has led to a polarized debate dominated by extremes. Roe v. Wade imposed one of the most permissive abortion regimes globally, allowing pro-choice extremism while foreclosing pro-life options. As a result, the pro-life movement has adopted an incremental strategy, aiming to gradually change attitudes and chip away at Roe. However, with the possibility of overturning Roe on the horizon, the movement has split between incrementalists and those who support a total ban, as seen in Alabama. The political reality is that most Americans desire a compromise, but the parties prioritize activists and donors, resulting in a disconnect between the public and party stances. The debate remains polarized, with Republicans highlighting late-term abortions and Democrats focusing on extreme cases of impregnated minors. The potential overturning of Roe v. Wade could lead to a shift in the dynamic, allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion and potentially reducing political passion.
