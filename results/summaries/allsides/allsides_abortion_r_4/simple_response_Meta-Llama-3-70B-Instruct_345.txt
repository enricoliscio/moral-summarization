SUMMARY:

The article discusses the extremes of the abortion debate in the US, citing the recent laws in New York and Alabama as examples. President Trump's statement about late-term abortions is deemed a distortion and exaggeration by fact-checkers. The article highlights that most Americans support early-stage abortions, but opposition grows as the fetus develops. The media's differing reactions to the New York and Alabama laws reveal a bias in the press. The article argues that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision has led to a polarized debate, with both pro-choice and pro-life movements taking absolutist positions. The Alabama law, which bans most abortions, is unconstitutional under current precedent, but its sponsors hope the Supreme Court's new conservative majority will overthrow Roe. The article concludes that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are more responsive to activists and donors, leading to a polarized and extreme debate.
