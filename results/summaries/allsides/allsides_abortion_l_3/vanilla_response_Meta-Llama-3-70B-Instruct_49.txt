SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, which was finalized in March, would have barred Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding under Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. Reproductive rights groups and state officials have challenged the rule, arguing it would leave low-income patients without access to healthcare. The rule is part of the Trump administration's efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics say will harm low-income women. The administration's actions have been praised by anti-abortion groups, but reproductive rights advocates vow to continue fighting the rule in court.
