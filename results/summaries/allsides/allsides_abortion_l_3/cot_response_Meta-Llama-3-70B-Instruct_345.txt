SUMMARY:
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a crucial victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, has been met with legal challenges from Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association, and other groups. Anti-abortion groups have applauded the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, critics argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to vital health care services, including contraceptive care. The move is seen as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, and has been framed as a "winning issue" for the president and the Republican Party in 2020.
