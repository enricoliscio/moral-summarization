SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, leaving low-income patients without access to health care they need. The rule, which has been blocked by a preliminary injunction, would restrict Title X funds and limit access to contraception and abortion. Anti-abortion groups have applauded the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule is illegal, compromises the oath to serve patients, and will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care. The rule is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to abortion and contraception, including allowing employers to get exemptions from offering contraceptive coverage. The administration's actions have been met with legal challenges and criticism from reproductive rights groups.
