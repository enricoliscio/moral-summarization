SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," has faced legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials. The rule prohibits entities that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals from receiving Title X funding, which pays for birth control and family planning services for low-income patients. Challengers argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to essential healthcare. The rule was temporarily blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict access to contraception and abortion, including allowing employers to opt-out of providing contraceptive coverage and appointing conservative Supreme Court justices. Critics argue that the administration's actions will limit access to reproductive healthcare and that the President may be using opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood as a political strategy for the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
