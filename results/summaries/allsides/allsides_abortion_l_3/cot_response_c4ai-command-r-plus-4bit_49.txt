SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule in March barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from obtaining federal family planning funds. The rule has been challenged in court and is currently blocked by a preliminary injunction. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," bars Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers or referrers from receiving Title X funding. Anti-abortion groups have backed such a rule, saying that organizations that perform abortions should not receive federal support. However, Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to needed health care. They also argue that the rule is illegal, unconscionable, and unethical, as it compromises the ability of providers to serve patients and help them explore their options, which include abortion. The Title X rule is one of several moves by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion. The administration has also released interim rules allowing employers to exempt themselves from the requirement to offer contraceptive coverage, and Trump has ramped up his anti-abortion rhetoric, which may be seen as a winning strategy for the 2020 election. The rule requires Title X recipients to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. This would effectively bar Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding. Providers of Title X services argue that they will struggle to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is locked out of funding, and that low-income patients will suffer repercussions and loss of access to care as a result.
