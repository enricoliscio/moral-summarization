SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a preliminary injunction, a major victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, was challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups. The rule would leave low-income patients without access to vital health services, including contraception and abortion. Planned Parenthood, which sees 41% of patients who get family planning services under Title X, argues that the rule is illegal and unethical, compromising the oath to serve patients and help them make informed decisions about their health. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, applaud the rule, saying it disentangles taxpayers from the "big abortion industry" led by Planned Parenthood. The ruling ensures that millions of low-income people will continue to receive vital health services, and reproductive rights advocates vow to continue fighting until the rule is blocked for good.
