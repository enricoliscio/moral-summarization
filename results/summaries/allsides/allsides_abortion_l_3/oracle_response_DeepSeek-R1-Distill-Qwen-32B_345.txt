Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words they listed. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. It's been challenged in court, with a recent injunction. The rule is called the "domestic gag rule" and affects Planned Parenthood, impacting low-income patients' access to care. There are legal battles, with both pro-life and pro-choice groups taking sides. The rule requires financial and physical separation from abortion services, affecting many providers. It's part of several actions by the administration limiting access to contraception and abortion, and it's tied to political strategy.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words. I should structure it to include the key events: the rule's issuance, the legal challenges, the impact on access, and the political context. I'll make sure to use words like "barred," "leave," "ensure," "blocked," "restrict," etc., to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by stating the administration's action, mention the rule's name, the legal battle, the injunction, and the impact on Planned Parenthood. Then, I'll include the opposing viewpoints: anti-abortion groups supporting it and Planned Parenthood arguing it's unethical and harmful. Finally, I'll note the broader context of other policies and the political strategy.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral words are included without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration issued a rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X, a move critics call the "domestic gag rule." The rule, which would leave low-income patients without access to vital health care, faced legal challenges and was recently blocked by a preliminary injunction from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Anti-abortion groups applaud the rule, arguing it disentangles taxpayers from funding abortion services, while Planned Parenthood and others argue it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling and compromises patient care. The rule would bar Title X recipients from performing abortions, even if funded separately, and would shrink the network of providers, leading to major repercussions for low-income women. The administration's actions, including allowing employers to opt out of contraceptive coverage, are part of a broader strategy to restrict access to abortion and contraception. The rule also aligns with Trump's anti-abortion rhetoric and his efforts to appeal to conservative voters ahead of the 2020 election.  
END OF SUMMARY.
