SUMMARY: In March, the Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule has been challenged in court and is currently blocked from taking effect while legal challenges continue. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," bars Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers or referrers from receiving Title X funding, which pays for birth control and family planning services for low-income patients. Challengers argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to needed health care, while supporters argue that organizations that provide abortions should not receive federal support. The rule also requires physical and financial separation between Title X recipients and entities that provide or refer for abortions. This would effectively bar all Planned Parenthood centers from receiving Title X funding. The rule has faced legal challenges from multiple groups, and temporary injunctions have been issued to block it from taking effect. Critics see the rule as part of a pattern of moves by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion.
