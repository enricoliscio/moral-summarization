SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ensuring that low-income patients will continue to receive vital health services. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds, was challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave many low-income patients without access to care, violating laws requiring unbiased counseling about all options, including abortion. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, applaud the rule, saying it disentangles taxpayers from the "big abortion industry" led by Planned Parenthood. The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, including allowing employers to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage and restricting Title X funds. The ruling is a victory in the fight against the administration's attempts to upend Title X and restrict access to health care.

END OF SUMMARY.
