SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ensuring that low-income patients will continue to receive vital health services. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds, was met with legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials. The rule, backed by anti-abortion groups, would leave many low-income patients without access to health care they need, compromising their ability to make informed decisions about their own health. Planned Parenthood, which sees about 41 percent of patients who get family planning services under Title X, argues that the rule is illegal and violates laws requiring unbiased counseling about all options, including abortion. The move to restrict Title X funds is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics say will have major repercussions for low-income women across the country.
