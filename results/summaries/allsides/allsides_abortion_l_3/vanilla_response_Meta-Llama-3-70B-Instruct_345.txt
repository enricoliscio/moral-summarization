SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, which was finalized in March, would have barred Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding under Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. Anti-abortion groups have backed the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, reproductive rights advocates argue that the rule would leave low-income patients without access to healthcare they need. The injunction is a temporary victory for Planned Parenthood and other challengers, who are fighting to ensure that millions of low-income people continue to receive vital health services.

END OF SUMMARY.
