SUMMARY: The Trump administration has released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule has been challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and state officials, who argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to critical healthcare. The rule would require providers receiving Title X funds to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. This would effectively bar Planned Parenthood, which provides family planning services to about 41% of patients under Title X, from receiving funding. The rule has been applauded by anti-abortion groups but criticized by Planned Parenthood and other groups who argue that it is illegal and unethical, compromising the oath that healthcare providers take to serve patients and help them make informed decisions about their health. The move is part of a larger pattern by the Trump administration to restrict access to contraception and abortion, including through changes to employer-provided health insurance and rhetoric opposing Planned Parenthood and abortion rights. The rule has been blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but the administration has appealed.
END OF SUMMARY.
