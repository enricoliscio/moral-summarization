SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a preliminary injunction issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The rule, which was finalized in March, would have barred clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X. The rule was challenged in court by state officials, reproductive rights groups, and healthcare providers, including Planned Parenthood. The rule would have required providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions, effectively cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood and other clinics. Critics argue that the rule would limit access to contraception and abortion, particularly for low-income patients. The injunction allows the legal challenges to continue, and reproductive rights advocates are celebrating the ruling as a victory.

END OF SUMMARY.
