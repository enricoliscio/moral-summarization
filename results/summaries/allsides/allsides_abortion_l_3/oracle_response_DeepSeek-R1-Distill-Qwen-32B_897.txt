Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The author used specific morally charged words like "barred," "leave," "care," "ruling," "fight," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The rule was finalized in March, challenged in court, and a preliminary injunction was issued in July. It's called the "domestic gag rule," affecting Title X funding. Anti-abortion groups support it, while Planned Parenthood and others argue it limits access to healthcare for low-income patients. The rule requires providers to be separate from any entity that performs or refers for abortions. There's been a legal battle, and the Ninth Circuit recently blocked it. The administration's other actions include allowing employers to opt out of contraceptive coverage. Trump's anti-abortion rhetoric has increased, and this might be a strategy for the 2020 election.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using the moral words. I'll start by mentioning the Trump administration issuing the rule, barring clinics, and the legal challenges. Then, I'll note the impact on low-income patients and the reactions from both sides. I'll include the injunction, the consequences if the rule takes effect, and the broader context of the administration's actions on contraception and abortion. I'll make sure to use words like "barred," "leave," "care," "ruling," "fight," "upend," "ensure," etc.

I should structure it so each sentence flows logically, covering the rule, its opposition, legal actions, consequences, and the administration's other policies. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is included with the appropriate moral framing words.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration issued a rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, sparking a legal battle. Known as the "domestic gag rule," it aims to restrict Title X funding, leaving low-income patients without essential care. Anti-abortion groups applaud the move, while Planned Parenthood and others argue it violates counseling laws and compromises patient care. A Ninth Circuit ruling temporarily blocked the rule, upending its implementation. Critics warn it could shrink healthcare access, with repercussions for millions relying on Title X. The administration's broader actions, including exemptions for contraceptive coverage, and Trump's anti-abortion rhetoric, signal a strategy to limit access, potentially aiding the Republican Party in 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
