SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, leaving low-income patients without access to health care they need. The rule, backed by anti-abortion groups, restricts Title X funds and limits access to contraception and abortion. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule is illegal, violating laws requiring unbiased counseling about all options, including abortion. The rule would require providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions, effectively blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funding. The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, and is seen as a winning issue for the president and the Republican Party in 2020. The rule has been blocked by a preliminary injunction, but the legal battle continues.

END OF SUMMARY.
