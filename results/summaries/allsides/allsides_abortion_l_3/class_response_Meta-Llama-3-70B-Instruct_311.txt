SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a significant victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, was challenged by state officials and reproductive rights groups. The rule would have left low-income patients without access to vital health services, including birth control and other family planning services. Planned Parenthood, which sees about 41% of patients who get family planning services under Title X, would have been barred from receiving funding. The rule is part of the Trump administration's efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion, and is seen as a winning issue for the president and the Republican Party in 2020. The ruling ensures that millions of low-income people will continue to receive vital health services, and is a major blow to the administration's attempts to upend Title X. END OF SUMMARY.
