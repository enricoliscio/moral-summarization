SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule in March barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds. This "domestic gag rule" was challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights advocates, who argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to health care they need. The rule bars Planned Parenthood and other providers that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals from receiving Title X funding. Anti-abortion groups have backed such a rule, claiming that organizations that provide abortions should not be receiving federal support. However, Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule is illegal and unethical as it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients about all their options, which include abortion. They argue that in many places, Planned Parenthood is the only option for low-income patients, and barring them from Title X funds would leave many without access to contraceptive care. The move to restrict Title X funds is one of several actions by the Trump administration that critics say limit access to contraception and abortion. The administration has also stepped up anti-abortion rhetoric and appointed conservative Supreme Court justices, signaling a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade and a shift in strategy for the 2020 election.
