SUMMARY: In March, the Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This "domestic gag rule" has faced legal challenges and injunctions from several groups, including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, who argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to essential health care. The rule was temporarily blocked by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 3 while legal challenges continue to work their way through the courts.

The rule bars Title X recipients from performing abortions or providing abortion referrals and requires physical and financial separation from any entity that does so. This would effectively bar Planned Parenthood, which provides family planning services to about 41 percent of patients under Title X, from receiving funding. Opponents argue that the rule violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and that it is unethical and compromises the doctor-patient relationship. Supporters of the rule, such as the Susan B. Anthony List, applaud the administration's action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion industry.

The Title X rule is one of several moves by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, and it comes as the president ramps up his anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election.
