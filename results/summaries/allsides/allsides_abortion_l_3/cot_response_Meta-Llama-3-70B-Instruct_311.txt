SUMMARY:
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a crucial victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, is seen as an attempt to "upend" the nation's only family planning program, Title X. Anti-abortion groups have applauded the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to "vital" health care services, including contraception and unbiased counseling about all their options, including abortion. The rule is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics see as a morally "unconscionable" and "unethical" attack on women's health.
