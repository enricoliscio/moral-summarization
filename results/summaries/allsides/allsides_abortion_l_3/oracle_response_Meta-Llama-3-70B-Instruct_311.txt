SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ensuring that low-income patients will continue to receive vital health services. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds, was challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave many low-income patients without access to health care they need, violating laws requiring unbiased counseling about all options, including abortion. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, applaud the rule, saying it will disentangle taxpayers from the abortion industry. The ruling is a victory in the fight against the Trump administration's attempts to upend Title X, a program that pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. The move to restrict Title X funds is one of several actions by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion.
