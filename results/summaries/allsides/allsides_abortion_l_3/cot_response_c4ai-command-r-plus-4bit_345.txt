SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds. The so-called "domestic gag rule" was challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and state officials, who argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to health care. The rule was blocked by a preliminary injunction in July, but the Trump administration has appealed. The rule bars Planned Parenthood and other providers that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals from receiving funding under Title X. Anti-abortion groups have long backed such a rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortions should not receive federal support. However, Planned Parenthood and other groups say that the rule violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care. The Trump administration has taken several other actions to restrict access to contraception and abortion, including limiting exemptions for employers who object to providing contraceptive coverage. The administration's moves come as the president ramps up his anti-abortion rhetoric and boosts his popularity among conservatives by appointing conservative Supreme Court justices. END OF SUMMARY.
