Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. It mentions legal challenges, injunctions, and the impact on low-income patients. 

I should identify the morally charged words the author used, like "challenged," "injunction," "blocking," "bars," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral perspective.

The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the rule and its purpose, then mention the legal battles and the injunction. I'll include the opposing views: anti-abortion groups supporting the rule and Planned Parenthood arguing it limits access. I'll also note the potential consequences, like reduced services for low-income patients.

I need to structure this logically, starting with the rule, then the legal aspects, followed by the opposing arguments, and ending with the implications. I'll make sure to use the specified morally framed words to reflect the author's stance.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll keep each point brief to stay within the limit. Also, I'll ensure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll end with the required tokens, making sure it's clear and meets all the user's instructions.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration's final rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds has sparked significant legal and moral debate. The rule, challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and states, aims to "disentangle" federal support from abortion services, a move supported by anti-abortion advocates. However, critics argue it will "leave" low-income patients without access to essential health services. Planned Parenthood, which serves about 41% of Title X patients, claims the rule is "unconscionable" and "unethical," as it "compromises" patient care and "limits" access to contraception and abortion counseling. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from abortion services, effectively barring Planned Parenthood from Title X funding. Legal battles have resulted in temporary injunctions, with the Ninth Circuit recently issuing a preliminary injunction to "block" the rule's implementation. Advocates view this as a "victory" in their fight to "ensure" continued access to vital services. Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups applaud the rule as a step to "stop" federal funding from "subsidizing" abortion. The rule's implementation could "shrink" the network of providers, leading to "major repercussions" for low-income women. END OF SUMMARY.
