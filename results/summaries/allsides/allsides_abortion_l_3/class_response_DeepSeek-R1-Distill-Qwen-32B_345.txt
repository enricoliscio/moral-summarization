Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I should start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral arguments presented.

The article discusses the Trump administration's rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This is known as the "domestic gag rule." The rule faced legal challenges and injunctions, and it's part of a broader strategy to limit access to abortion services, especially for low-income individuals.

I need to include words like "challenged," "injunction," "blocking," "bars," "leave," "ruling," "victory," "upend," "ensure," "continue," "services," "give," "blocked," "limit," "abortion," "ramps," "barred," "proposed," "prohibited," "action," "disentangle," "steps," "stop," "subsidizing," "care," "counseling," "unconscionable," "unethical," "compromises," "serve," "shrink," "repercussions."

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the administration's actions and the impact on access to healthcare. Mention the legal battles, the injunctions, and the arguments from both sides. Make sure to include the moral terms to reflect the framing.

I'll start by stating the rule's implementation and the legal challenges. Then, explain the impact on low-income patients and the arguments from Planned Parenthood and anti-abortion groups. Conclude with the broader implications and the political context.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key moral points are covered without losing the essence of the article.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration's final rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds has been met with legal challenges and moral debate. Known as the "domestic gag rule," it prohibits Title X funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions or referrals. The rule, challenged in court, faced a preliminary injunction in July, blocking its implementation. Advocates argue it will leave low-income patients without access to vital health services, while anti-abortion groups applaud the move to "disentangle" taxpayers from abortion funding. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from abortion services, potentially shrinking the network of family planning providers and harming low-income communities. Critics call it "unconscionable" and "unethical," compromising patient care and counseling. The administration's actions, part of a broader strategy to limit access to contraception and abortion, have sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a winning issue for 2020. The legal battle continues, with opponents seeking to "ensure" continued access to essential health services. END OF SUMMARY.
