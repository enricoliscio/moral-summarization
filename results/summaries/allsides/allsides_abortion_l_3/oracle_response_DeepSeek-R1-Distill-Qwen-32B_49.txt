Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses the Trump administration's final rule that bars clinics providing or referring for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This is called the "domestic gag rule." It's been challenged in court, and the Ninth Circuit recently issued a preliminary injunction blocking it. 

The rule affects Planned Parenthood and others, potentially leaving low-income patients without access to health care. Critics argue it restricts access to contraception and abortion, while supporters see it as disentangling taxpayers from abortion services.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: issued, bars, leave, care, ruling, fight, upend, ensure, receive, rule, blocked, restrict, limit, barred, action, disentangle, stop, abortion, violates, counseling, compromises, serve, help, provider, shrink, repercussions, rules, allowing, exemption, requirement, rhetoric.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the legal battle, the impact on low-income patients, and the broader implications of the rule. I'll start by stating the rule and its purpose, then mention the legal challenges, the injunction, and the opposing viewpoints. Finally, I'll touch on the administration's other actions and the political context.

Let me make sure to use the moral terms effectively without making the summary too long. I'll aim for around 200 words, keeping it concise but comprehensive.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration issued a rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule, which would restrict Title X funding, faced legal challenges and was recently blocked by a preliminary injunction from the Ninth Circuit. Critics argue the rule leaves low-income patients without access to vital health care, while supporters applaud it for disentangling taxpayers from abortion services. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from entities that perform abortions, effectively barring Planned Parenthood and others from receiving funds. Advocates claim it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling and compromises patient care, while abortion opponents see it as a victory in the fight against abortion. The rule is part of broader actions by the administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, with Trump increasing anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
