SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds, sparking legal challenges from state officials and reproductive rights groups. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," blocks Planned Parenthood and other providers that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals from receiving Title X funding. Opponents argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to critical healthcare services and is a violation of laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients. Planned Parenthood and other groups have successfully obtained preliminary injunctions to block the rule, with the most recent injunction issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on July 3. Supporters of the rule, including anti-abortion groups, applaud the administration's action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion industry. However, critics argue that the rule will limit access to contraception and abortion and have major repercussions for low-income women. The Title X rule is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict access to abortion and contraceptive services, with the president ramping up anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
