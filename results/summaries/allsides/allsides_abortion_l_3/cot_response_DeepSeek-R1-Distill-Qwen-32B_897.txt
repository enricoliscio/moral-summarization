Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule is called the "domestic gag rule" and it's facing legal challenges. 

I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the text again. Words like "barred," "challenge," "illegal," "unconscionable," "unethical," "winning," "disentangle," "pro-life," "anti-abortion," "access," "vital," "rely," "compromises," "oath," "exemption," "controversy," "popularity," "winning strategy." These words carry moral connotations, so I should include them in the summary.

Now, for the summary. I'll start by stating the rule and its impact. Then mention the legal battles and the injunction. Include the perspectives from both sides: anti-abortion groups supporting the rule and Planned Parenthood arguing it limits access and is unethical. Also, mention the potential consequences like reduced access to services and the political implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the morally framed words identified.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" prohibits clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, sparking legal battles. Critics argue it limits low-income patients' access to vital health services, while anti-abortion groups applaud it as a step to disentangle taxpayers from abortion funding. The rule, which would bar Planned Parenthood and others from Title X funding, has faced challenges in court, with a recent injunction blocking its implementation. Proponents see it as a winning strategy, while opponents view it as unethical and harmful to vulnerable populations. The rule's potential impact includes reduced access to contraceptives and increased caseloads for other providers, highlighting its contentious nature in the ongoing debate over abortion rights.
