Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a rule by the Trump administration that affects federal family planning funds. They're barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from getting these funds. This rule is called the "domestic gag rule" by reproductive rights advocates. 

The rule was challenged in court, and there's been a legal battle since March. The Ninth Circuit Court recently issued an injunction blocking the rule. The rule affects Title X funding, which provides services to low-income patients. Planned Parenthood is a big player here because they serve many patients under Title X, and if they can't get funding, it might limit access to healthcare for low-income people.

Anti-abortion groups support the rule, saying organizations that perform abortions shouldn't get federal money. But Planned Parenthood and others argue it will hurt access to care. The rule requires providers to be separate from any entity that does abortions, which would exclude Planned Parenthood from Title X funds.

The article also mentions other actions by the Trump administration limiting access to contraception and abortion, and how this rule fits into their broader strategy, especially with the 2020 election in mind. There's some history with a similar rule under Reagan that only lasted a month.

So, the summary should include the rule's content, the legal challenges, the impact on Planned Parenthood and low-income patients, the opposing viewpoints, and the broader context of the administration's policies. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration's final rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," prohibits clinics providing or referring for abortions from receiving federal Title X family planning funds. This rule, challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and states, faced a legal battle, with the Ninth Circuit recently issuing a preliminary injunction to block its implementation. The rule would exclude Planned Parenthood and other providers from Title X funding, potentially limiting access to contraceptives and health services for low-income patients. Critics argue it violates patient counseling laws, while anti-abortion groups support it, calling it a step to disentangle taxpayers from abortion services. The rule is part of the administration's broader efforts to restrict access to contraception and abortion, coinciding with increased anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
