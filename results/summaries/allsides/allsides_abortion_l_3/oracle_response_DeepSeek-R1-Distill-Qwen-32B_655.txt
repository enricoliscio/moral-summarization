Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. It's called the "domestic gag rule" and has faced legal challenges.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used, like "barred," "leave," "ensure," "blocked," etc. My summary needs to include as many of these words as possible. I'll structure the summary to include the rule's introduction, the legal battles, the impact on low-income patients, and the reactions from both sides.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll also ensure that the moral framing is maintained by using the specified words where appropriate. Let me draft a few sentences, making sure to include the key points and the moral language.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration finalized a rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule, which would restrict Title X funding, faced legal challenges and was temporarily blocked by a court injunction. Critics argue it will leave low-income patients without access to essential health care, while supporters applaud it as a move to disentangle taxpayers from abortion services. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from entities that perform or refer for abortions, effectively barring Planned Parenthood and other organizations. Proponents of the rule, like anti-abortion groups, see it as a step to stop federal funds from subsidizing abortion, while opponents claim it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling and compromises patient care. The rule's implementation could shrink the network of providers, leading to major repercussions for low-income women. The administration's move is part of broader efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion, aligning with the president's anti-abortion rhetoric and potential 2020 political strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
