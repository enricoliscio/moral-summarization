SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, which bars Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding under Title X, has been met with legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials. Anti-abortion groups have backed the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, critics argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to essential healthcare services. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, and has been seen as a winning issue for the president and the Republican Party in 2020.
