Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration's rule on family planning funds. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a final rule released in March that stops clinics providing or referring for abortions from getting federal funds under Title X. This rule has been challenged in court by various groups. The Ninth Circuit recently issued an injunction, blocking the rule temporarily.

Key points: The rule is called the "domestic gag rule," affecting Planned Parenthood and other providers. It requires separation from abortion services, which would exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds. Critics argue it limits access to contraceptives for low-income patients. Supporters, like anti-abortion groups, approve, seeing it as a way to stop federal support for abortion services.

Planned Parenthood serves a significant portion of Title X patients, so the rule could leave many without access. Other providers would need to increase their services, which might not be feasible. The article also mentions other Trump administration actions limiting contraception access and the political implications as 2020 approaches.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the rule, its impact, legal challenges, and the debate around it. Make sure to include both sides' arguments and the significance of the injunction.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration's final rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," prohibits clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal Title X family planning funds. This rule has faced legal challenges, with a recent injunction by the Ninth Circuit blocking its implementation. Critics argue the rule limits access to contraceptives for low-income patients, particularly affecting Planned Parenthood, which serves 41% of Title X patients. Supporters, including anti-abortion groups, applaud the move to prevent federal funding for abortion services. The rule requires providers to be separate from abortion-related activities, potentially excluding Planned Parenthood from funding. Other providers would need to increase their caseloads significantly to compensate, raising concerns about access. The rule is part of broader Trump administration efforts to restrict abortion and contraception access, with political implications as the 2020 election approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
