SUMMARY:
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a major victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, has been deemed "unconscionable" and "unethical" by Planned Parenthood and other groups. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, have applauded the rule, seeing it as a "winning" strategy for the Republican Party. The rule would have left low-income patients without access to "vital" health care services, including contraception and abortion. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics argue is "illegal" and violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients.
