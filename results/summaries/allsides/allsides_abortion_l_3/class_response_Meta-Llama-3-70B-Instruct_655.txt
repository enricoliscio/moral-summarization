SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ensuring that low-income patients will continue to receive vital health services. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from getting federal family planning funds, has been challenged by reproductive rights groups and state officials. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care and is unethical. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, applaud the rule, saying it will stop taxpayers from subsidizing abortion. The ruling is a victory in the fight against the Trump administration's attempts to upend Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics say will have major repercussions for low-income women across the country.
