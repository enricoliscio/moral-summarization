SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." The rule faced legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials, with a recent injunction blocking its implementation. The rule prohibits Title X recipients from performing abortions or providing abortion referrals and would primarily affect Planned Parenthood, which serves a significant portion of low-income patients. Opponents argue that it will limit access to contraceptive care and is illegal, while abortion opponents applaud the decision. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict access to contraception and abortion, with potential political implications for the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
