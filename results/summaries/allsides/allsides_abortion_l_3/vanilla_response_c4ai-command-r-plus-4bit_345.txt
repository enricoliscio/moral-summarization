SUMMARY: In March, the Trump administration issued a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule has been challenged in court and is currently blocked from taking effect. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," prohibits Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from receiving Title X funding. Opponents argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to healthcare, while supporters argue that organizations that provide abortions should not receive federal support. The rule also requires Title X recipients to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule is illegal and unethical. The Trump administration has taken several other actions to limit access to contraception and abortion, including releasing interim rules allowing employers to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage. The administration's efforts come as Trump ramps up anti-abortion rhetoric and appoints conservative Supreme Court justices.
