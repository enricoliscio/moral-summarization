SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a US Court of Appeals, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, which bars Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding under Title X, has been met with legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials. Anti-abortion groups have applauded the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, critics argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to healthcare they need. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, and comes as the president ramps up his anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election.
