Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Trump administration's rule on Title X funding and its implications. Let me break it down.

First, the rule bars clinics that provide or refer for abortions from getting federal funds. This is called the "domestic gag rule." It's been legally challenged, and the Ninth Circuit recently blocked it. 

I should mention the key points: who's affected (Planned Parenthood, low-income patients), the legal battle, and the arguments from both sides. Proponents argue against taxpayer funding for abortion, while opponents say it limits access to essential services.

Also, the rule's impact on Planned Parenthood's patient numbers and the potential strain on other providers should be included. The moral aspect is crucialâ€”supporters see it as a stance against abortion, while critics see it as restricting healthcare access.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral debate. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has finalized a rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X, a move critics call the "domestic gag rule." The rule, challenged in court by Planned Parenthood and others, was recently blocked by a Ninth Circuit injunction. Supporters argue that organizations providing abortions should not receive federal support, while opponents claim the rule will deny low-income patients access to essential health services. Planned Parenthood, which serves about 41% of Title X patients, says the rule compromises patient care and violates laws requiring unbiased counseling. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from abortion services, effectively barring Planned Parenthood from Title X funding. Critics warn this will strain other providers, as they would need to increase caseloads by 70% to cover the gap. The rule is part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit access to contraception and abortion, with the president also ramping up anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
