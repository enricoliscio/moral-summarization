SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a federal appeals court, preventing clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, which was finalized in March, would have barred Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving funding under Title X, which pays for birth control and other family planning services for low-income patients. Anti-abortion groups have backed the rule, arguing that organizations that provide abortion should not receive federal support. However, reproductive rights advocates say the rule would leave low-income patients without access to healthcare they need. The court's injunction allows the case to proceed, with the ACLU and other groups arguing that the rule is illegal and unethical. The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion.

END OF SUMMARY.
