SUMMARY: The Trump administration issued a rule barring clinics that provide abortions or referrals from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," was challenged in court and blocked by a preliminary injunction from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The rule bars Planned Parenthood and other providers from receiving Title X funding if they perform abortions or offer abortion referrals. Abortion opponents argue that organizations that provide abortions should not receive federal support, while Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to healthcare. The rule restricts Title X funds and is one of several actions by the Trump administration that limit access to contraception and abortion. It requires providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. The move to restrict Title X funds is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion and to ramp up anti-abortion rhetoric. The rule has been challenged in court by Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association, the NFPRHA, the ACLU, and several states. The Ninth Circuit's injunction is an important victory in the fight to ensure that low-income patients continue to receive vital health care services.
