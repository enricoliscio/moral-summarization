Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration's rule regarding federal family planning funds. The article is quite detailed, so I should focus on the key points. 

First, the rule was released in March, barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal funds under Title X. This is called the "domestic gag rule." It's been legally challenged since its release. 

The Ninth Circuit Court issued a preliminary injunction in July, blocking the rule temporarily. The rule affects Planned Parenthood and other providers, potentially leaving low-income patients without access to family planning services. 

Planned Parenthood argues that the rule is illegal because it violates patient counseling laws. They serve a significant portion of Title X patients, so the rule could have a big impact. 

Anti-abortion groups support the rule, but critics say it limits access to contraception and abortion. The administration has made several moves to restrict these services, and Trump's anti-abortion stance is part of his strategy for the 2020 election. 

I should make sure the summary includes the main actors, the legal battles, the impact on access, and the political context. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" prohibits clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal Title X family planning funds. The rule, finalized in March, faced immediate legal challenges and was temporarily blocked by a Ninth Circuit Court injunction in July. Critics argue it will limit low-income patients' access to essential health services, as Planned Parenthood, which serves about 41% of Title X patients, would lose funding. Supporters, including anti-abortion groups, applaud the rule as a step to disentangle federal funds from abortion services. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from abortion-related activities, though they were already barred from using Title X funds for abortions. The legal battle continues, with opponents seeking to permanently block the rule. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to restrict access to contraception and abortion, aligning with the president's anti-abortion rhetoric and potential 2020 election strategy.
