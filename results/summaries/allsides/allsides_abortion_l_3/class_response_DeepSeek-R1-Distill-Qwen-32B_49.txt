Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule is called the "domestic gag rule." It's faced legal challenges, with a recent injunction from the Ninth Circuit blocking it. The rule affects Planned Parenthood and other providers, potentially limiting access to healthcare for low-income patients. Anti-abortion groups support it, while reproductive rights advocates oppose it, arguing it's unethical and harmful.

Now, I need to identify the key points to include in the summary:

1. The rule was released by the Trump administration in March, barring clinics from federal funds if they provide or refer for abortions.
2. It's been legally challenged, with a recent injunction from the Ninth Circuit.
3. The rule is known as the "domestic gag rule."
4. It affects Title X funding, impacting low-income patients.
5. Supporters (anti-abortion groups) applaud the rule, while opponents argue it limits access to healthcare and is unethical.
6. The rule requires providers to be separate from abortion services, even if they cover costs elsewhere.
7. The impact on low-income patients and potential service shortages.

I should use as many of the provided moral words as possible: challenged, injunction, blocking, bars, leave, ruling, victory, upend, ensure, continue, services, give, blocked, limit, abortion, ramps, barred, proposed, prohibited, action, disentangle, steps, stop, subsidizing, care, counseling, unconscionable, unethical, compromises, serve, shrink, repercussions.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral framing is preserved. I'll mention the legal challenges, the injunction, the impact on access, and the ethical arguments from both sides.

Let me draft the summary step by step:

- Start with the administration's action and the rule.
- Mention the legal challenges and injunction.
- Explain the impact on clinics and low-income patients.
- Include the moral arguments from both sides.
- Conclude with the potential consequences.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points with the moral language.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration finalized a rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule, which faced legal challenges, was recently blocked by a Ninth Circuit injunction. Critics argue it limits access to healthcare for low-income patients, while supporters applaud it as a step to disentangle federal funds from abortion services. The rule requires providers to be separate from abortion services, even if they cover costs elsewhere. Reproductive rights groups, including Planned Parenthood, argue it is unconscionable and unethical, compromising patient care and access. The injunction is seen as a victory in the fight to ensure continued vital services for millions. The rule, part of broader administration actions limiting contraception access, has sparked ethical debates and potential repercussions for low-income women. END OF SUMMARY.
