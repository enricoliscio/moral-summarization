Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration's rule that stops clinics providing or referring for abortions from getting federal family planning funds. It's called the "domestic gag rule." The rule was challenged in court, and a preliminary injunction was issued to block it. 

I should note the key elements: the rule's impact on Planned Parenthood, the legal battles, the arguments from both sides, and the broader context of the administration's actions on reproductive rights.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the rule's purpose, mention the legal challenges, the injunction, and the opposing views. I'll also include the implications for low-income patients and other related policies.

Let me structure it: introduce the rule, the legal status, the arguments from anti-abortion groups and Planned Parenthood, the consequences of the rule, and the administration's broader actions. I'll make sure to highlight the Ninth Circuit injunction and the potential effects on healthcare access.

I should avoid jargon and keep it concise. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all critical points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" prohibits clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X, affecting low-income patients. The rule, finalized in March, faced immediate legal challenges and was blocked by a Ninth Circuit injunction on July 3. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, arguing that abortion providers should not receive federal funding, while Planned Parenthood and others claim it will deny essential health services to low-income individuals. The rule requires Title X recipients to be physically and financially separate from abortion providers, effectively barring Planned Parenthood from funding. Critics argue it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients. Other providers would struggle to cover the increased demand if Planned Parenthood is excluded. The rule is part of the administration's broader efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion, aligning with Trump's anti-abortion rhetoric and conservative judicial appointments.
