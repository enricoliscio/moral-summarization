Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration's rule bars clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This is called the "domestic gag rule." It's been challenged in court, and the Ninth Circuit issued an injunction blocking it. The rule is part of several actions by the administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which Planned Parenthood and others argue will leave low-income patients without necessary care.

I need to include words like "issued," "bars," "leave," "care," "ruling," "fight," "upend," "ensure," "receive," "rule," "blocked," "restrict," "limit," "barred," "action," "disentangle," "stop," "abortion," "violates," "counseling," "compromises," "serve," "help," "provider," "shrink," "repercussions," "rules," "allowing," "exemption," "requirement," "rhetoric."

I'll start by stating the rule was issued and its purpose. Mention the legal challenges and the injunction. Highlight the impact on low-income patients and the arguments from both sides. Conclude with the broader context of the administration's actions and the political implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key morally charged words without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is concise and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration issued a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X, a move criticized as the "domestic gag rule." The rule faced legal challenges, with a recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit blocking its implementation. Advocates argue the rule will leave low-income patients without access to essential health care, as Planned Parenthood serves about 41% of Title X patients. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from entities that perform abortions, effectively barring Planned Parenthood and others from funding. Critics say it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling and compromises patient care. Anti-abortion groups applaud the rule, calling it a step to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion industry. The rule is part of broader Trump administration actions to restrict access to contraception and abortion, amid heightened anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
