SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," was challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups, who argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to necessary health care. The rule was temporarily blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit while legal challenges continue. 

The rule bars Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers or referrers from receiving Title X funding, which pays for birth control and family planning services for low-income patients. It requires that providers receiving Title X funds be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. This means that Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions, would be barred from receiving any Title X funding. 

Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and will compromise the ability of doctors to serve and help patients make the best decisions for their health. They also argue that it will shrink the network of participating providers and have major repercussions for low-income women. 

The "domestic gag rule" is part of a larger pattern of actions by the Trump administration that critics say will restrict access to contraception and abortion.
END OF SUMMARY.
