SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This "domestic gag rule," as some reproductive rights advocates call it, was challenged in court by state officials and groups like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The rule was blocked by a preliminary injunction from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Trump administration has continued to fight for its implementation. The rule bars Title X recipients from performing abortions and requires providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. This would effectively bar Planned Parenthood, which serves about 41% of patients receiving family planning services under Title X, from receiving funding. Opponents of the rule argue that it will leave low-income patients without access to necessary healthcare and contraceptive care. They also claim that the rule violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and compromises the ability of providers to serve patients and help them make informed decisions about their health. The move to restrict Title X funds is part of a broader pattern by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, including through changes to employer requirements for contraceptive coverage and inflammatory anti-abortion rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
