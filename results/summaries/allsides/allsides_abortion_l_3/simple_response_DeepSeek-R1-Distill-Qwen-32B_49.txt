Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. The main points are about the Trump administration's rule restricting Title X funds to clinics that provide or refer for abortions. It's been challenged in court and recently got a preliminary injunction. 

I should highlight the moral arguments from both sides. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, saying taxpayer money shouldn't fund abortions. On the other hand, Planned Parenthood and others argue it limits access for low-income patients. I need to mention how Planned Parenthood serves a significant portion of Title X patients and the potential impact on healthcare access.

Also, the rule's history, like the Reagan-era gag rule, is relevant. It's important to note that while providers can't use Title X funds for abortions, they could perform them with other funds before. Now, they must be completely separate, which affects Planned Parenthood and other clinics.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the legal battle, the implications for healthcare access, and the moral viewpoints. I'll structure it by introducing the rule, its impact, the legal challenges, and the opposing arguments. That should cover the essential points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration's final rule barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds has sparked a legal battle. Known as the "domestic gag rule," it prohibits organizations like Planned Parenthood from accessing Title X funding, which provides birth control and family planning services to low-income individuals. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, arguing that taxpayer money should not fund abortion-related services. However, Planned Parenthood and reproductive rights advocates argue it will leave low-income patients without access to essential health care, as the organization serves about 41% of Title X patients. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that performs or refers for abortions, effectively barring Planned Parenthood and other clinics from receiving funding. Critics, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, argue the rule violates patients' rights to unbiased counseling and access to care. A recent Ninth Circuit injunction temporarily blocked the rule, but legal challenges continue. The rule is part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit access to contraception and abortion, aligning with the president's anti-abortion rhetoric and conservative Supreme Court appointments. END OF SUMMARY.
