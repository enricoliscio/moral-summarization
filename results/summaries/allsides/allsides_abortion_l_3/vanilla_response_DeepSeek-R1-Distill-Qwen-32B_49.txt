Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Trump administration's rule regarding federal family planning funds and abortions. They're barring clinics that provide or refer for abortions from getting these funds. The rule was challenged in court, and the Ninth Circuit recently issued an injunction blocking it. 

The rule is called the "domestic gag rule" by advocates. It affects Title X funding, which helps low-income patients with birth control and family planning. Planned Parenthood is a big name here because they provide these services to many low-income individuals. They argue that this rule will limit access to necessary healthcare. 

Anti-abortion groups support the rule, saying organizations that perform abortions shouldn't get federal money. The rule requires providers to be separate from any entity that does abortions, which would exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds. 

There's been legal battles since the rule was proposed, with temporary injunctions lifted after appeals. The Ninth Circuit's recent injunction is a win for Planned Parenthood and others. They're fighting to keep the rule from taking effect permanently. 

The article also mentions other actions by the Trump administration limiting access to contraception and abortion, and how this might be part of a strategy for the 2020 election, especially with the Supreme Court appointments. 

So, the summary should include the rule's impact, the legal battles, the arguments from both sides, and the broader context of the administration's policies. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the rule, mention the legal challenges, the impact on Planned Parenthood and low-income patients, the arguments for and against, and the significance of the Ninth Circuit injunction. Also, touch on the broader implications and the administration's other actions. 

I should make sure to include key points without getting too detailed. Maybe start with the rule's release, then the legal battle, the effect on Title X funding, the arguments from both sides, the injunction, and the context of the administration's strategy. 

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be precise and avoid unnecessary details. Make sure to highlight the main issues: the rule's content, its opponents and supporters, legal status, and the consequences for access to healthcare. 

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me put it all together in a concise summary.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration's final rule bars clinics providing or referring for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule, part of Title X, faces legal challenges from Planned Parenthood and others, who argue it limits low-income patients' access to essential healthcare. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, stating organizations performing abortions shouldn't receive federal funds. The rule requires providers to be separate from abortion services, excluding Planned Parenthood from Title X funding. Legal battles ensued, with a recent Ninth Circuit injunction temporarily blocking the rule. Critics warn it could reduce access to contraceptives, especially in areas where Planned Parenthood is the sole provider. The rule is part of broader Trump administration efforts to limit abortion access, aligning with conservative strategies ahead of the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
