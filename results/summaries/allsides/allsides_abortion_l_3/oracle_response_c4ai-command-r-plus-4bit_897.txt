SUMMARY: The Trump administration has issued a final rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," has faced legal challenges from reproductive rights groups and state officials. The rule would restrict Title X funds from going to providers that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals, including Planned Parenthood. Opponents argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to healthcare and contraceptive care they need. They also argue that the rule violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients. Supporters of the rule, such as anti-abortion groups, applaud the administration's action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion industry. The rule has been blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit while legal challenges continue. The move to restrict Title X funds is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, including allowing employers to exempt themselves from providing contraceptive coverage in employee health insurance. The administration's actions and the president's anti-abortion rhetoric may be seen as a strategy to boost popularity among conservatives going into the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
