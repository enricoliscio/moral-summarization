SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a preliminary injunction issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a major victory for reproductive rights advocates. The rule, which bars clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, has been challenged in court by state officials and reproductive rights groups. Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to vital health services, compromising their care and limiting their options. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, applaud the rule, saying it disentangles taxpayers from the abortion industry. The ruling ensures that millions of low-income people will continue to receive essential health services, and reproductive rights advocates vow to fight until the rule is blocked for good. The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to limit access to contraception and abortion, which critics say will have major repercussions for low-income women across the country.
