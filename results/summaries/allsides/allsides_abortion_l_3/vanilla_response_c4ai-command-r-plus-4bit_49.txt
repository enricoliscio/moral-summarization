SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a final rule in March barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," has been challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and state officials. The Ninth Circuit issued a preliminary injunction blocking the rule from taking effect while legal challenges continue. The rule bars Title X recipients from performing abortions and requires providers to be physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers abortions. Opponents argue that the rule will leave low-income patients without access to contraceptive care and is illegal, while supporters argue that organizations that provide abortions should not receive federal support. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict access to contraception and abortion, which may be a winning strategy for the president and the Republican Party in 2020.
