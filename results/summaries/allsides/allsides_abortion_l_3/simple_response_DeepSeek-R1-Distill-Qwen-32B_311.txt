Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the Trump administration's rule to bar clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule is called the "domestic gag rule." 

The article mentions that the rule was challenged in court and the Ninth Circuit issued an injunction. It also talks about how Planned Parenthood serves a significant portion of low-income patients under Title X. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, while Planned Parenthood argues it limits access to healthcare and violates counseling laws.

I should capture the key points: the rule's content, the legal challenges, the impact on low-income patients, and the opposing viewpoints. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral perspectives are clear—pro-life groups supporting the rule and pro-choice groups opposing it due to reduced access to care.

Let me structure it: start with the rule, mention the legal battle, the impact on Planned Parenthood, the arguments from both sides, and the broader context of the administration's actions. Make sure to include the injunction and the potential consequences if the rule is implemented.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise. Also, highlight the moral framing by showing how each side views the issue—anti-abortion groups see it as preventing taxpayer funding of abortions, while pro-choice groups see it as denying necessary healthcare to low-income individuals.

Alright, time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration finalized a rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds, known as the "domestic gag rule." This rule, challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and states, faced a preliminary injunction by the Ninth Circuit in July, temporarily blocking its implementation. Advocates argue the rule will deny low-income patients access to essential health services, as Planned Parenthood, which serves 41% of Title X patients, would lose funding. Anti-abortion groups support the rule, claiming it prevents taxpayer funding of abortions. The rule requires providers to be physically and financially separate from entities offering abortions, affecting not only Planned Parenthood but also other clinics. Critics, including Planned Parenthood, argue it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and would leave many without access to contraceptives. The rule is part of the administration's broader efforts to limit access to abortion and contraception, with Trump also increasing anti-abortion rhetoric. The legal battle continues, with both sides framing the issue as a moral imperative. END OF SUMMARY.
