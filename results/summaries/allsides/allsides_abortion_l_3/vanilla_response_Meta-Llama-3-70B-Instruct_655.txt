SUMMARY:

The Trump administration's "domestic gag rule" has been blocked by a preliminary injunction issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The rule would have barred clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds under Title X. Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights groups argue that the rule would leave low-income patients without access to healthcare services. The rule was first proposed in 2018 and was finalized in March, but was immediately challenged in court. The injunction allows the legal challenges to continue, ensuring that millions of low-income people will continue to receive vital health services. The move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to limit access to contraception and abortion, and comes as the president ramps up his anti-abortion rhetoric ahead of the 2020 election.
