SUMMARY: The Trump administration issued a rule barring clinics that provide or refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. This rule, known as the "domestic gag rule," was challenged in court by reproductive rights groups and state officials, who argued that it would leave low-income patients without access to essential health care. The rule was blocked by a preliminary injunction from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which prevented it from taking effect while legal challenges proceeded. The rule prohibits providers who receive Title X funds from performing abortions or offering abortion referrals, specifically targeting Planned Parenthood. While anti-abortion groups have applauded the rule, Planned Parenthood and other advocates argue that it violates laws requiring unbiased counseling for pregnant patients and will limit access to contraceptive care for low-income individuals. The move is part of a broader pattern by the Trump administration to restrict access to contraception and abortion, with the administration also releasing rules in 2017 and 2018 that allowed employers to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage in employee health insurance. Critics view the administration's actions and the president's anti-abortion rhetoric as a strategy to gain support for the upcoming 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
