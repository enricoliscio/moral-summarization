Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. It's about a group of parents suing a school district in Wisconsin over a policy related to gender identity. Okay, the key points are that 14 parents filed a lawsuit through a conservative law firm, WILL, against the Madison school district. The policy allows students to use their preferred gender identity without notifying parents. The lawsuit argues this violates parents' constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing. The school district's policy from 2018 says students can choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, even though changing legal names requires it. The parents also claim it interferes with their religious beliefs. The district hasn't responded yet but supports their policy. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should include the main elements: who, what, when, where, why. The parents' group, the law firm, the school district, the policy details, the constitutional arguments, and the religious aspect. I need to make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll make sure to mention the lawsuit's basis in constitutional rights, the policy's specifics, and the parents' arguments about both due process and religious freedom. Also, note that the district hasn't responded yet but stands by their policy.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and infringes on their religious freedom. The MMSD policy, introduced in 2018, permits students to choose their preferred names and pronouns at school without parental consent, while legally changing a child's name requires parental approval. The parents claim the policy circumvents their involvement in decisions affecting their children's health and future, including potential gender dysphoria. The lawsuit also alleges that the policy interferes with parents' ability to provide necessary professional help and aligns with their religious beliefs that humans are intended to be male or female. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but maintains its support for its transgender and nonbinary student policies. END OF SUMMARY.
