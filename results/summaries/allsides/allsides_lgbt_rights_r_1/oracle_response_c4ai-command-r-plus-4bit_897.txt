SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, alleges that the district's policy is unconstitutional and violates parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district is committed to affirming each student's self-designated gender identity and allows students to use chosen names and pronouns without parental permission. The parents argue that this policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without their knowledge or consent, interfering with their right to guide their children according to their beliefs and provide necessary support. They further claim that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate parents' rights and disrupt the district's policy that keeps secrets from parents about their children's gender identity struggles.
END OF SUMMARY.
