Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The article is about a lawsuit filed by parents against a school district over a gender identity policy. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The main issue is that 14 Wisconsin parents are suing the Madison Metropolitan School District because the district's policy allows students to use their preferred gender identity without notifying the parents. The conservative law firm, WILL, is representing the parents, arguing that this violates the parents' constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used, such as "allowing," "notifying," "prohibits," etc. My summary needs to include as many of these words as possible to maintain the original moral framing.

I need to structure the summary to include the lawsuit details, the policy specifics, the parents' arguments, and the school district's stance. I'll make sure to highlight the conflict between the school's inclusive policy and the parents' rights, emphasizing the moral and constitutional aspects.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by introducing the lawsuit, then explain the policy, the parents' arguments, and the district's response. I'll ensure that the moral terms are used naturally within the summary to reflect the author's framing.

Finally, I'll conclude by summarizing the broader implications, such as the clash between parental rights and school policies on gender identity. This should encapsulate the moral debate presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The MMSD policy, announced in 2018, enables students to socially transition at school without parental notice or consent, while also striving to "disrupt the gender binary" through educational materials. Parents argue that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it hides children's gender struggles from parents who believe in traditional gender roles based on religious beliefs. The lawsuit claims the district's actions circumvent parental involvement and enable children to make pivotal decisions without parental input. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its policy supporting transgender and nonbinary students. The case highlights a clash between parental rights and school policies affirming gender identity. END OF SUMMARY.
