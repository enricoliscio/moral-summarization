SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has taken legal action to vindicate their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, alleging that the Madison Metropolitan School District's (MMSD) transgender policy violates their constitutional rights. The policy, adopted in 2018, allows teachers to address students by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying parents first, circumventing parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future. The lawsuit argues that this policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, violating parents' right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The parents claim that the policy interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help their children may urgently need. By keeping parents in the dark about their children's sexuality, the policy also violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee. The parents seek to protect their rights and prevent the district from making decisions reserved for them.
