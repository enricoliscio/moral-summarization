Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a lawsuit filed by 14 Wisconsin parents against a school district for their gender identity policy. The key elements are the parents' rights, the school's policy, and the moral terms used.

I should note the morally framed words the author used, like "allowing," "prohibits," "vindicate," etc. My summary must include as many of these as possible. I'll need to condense the information without losing the essence of the moral arguments presented.

I'll start by identifying the main actors: the parents, the school district, and the conservative law firm. The lawsuit's purpose is to protect parents' rights to direct their children's upbringing. The school's policy allows students to use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent, which the parents argue violates due process and religious freedom.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the school's progressive policy and the parents' rights. I'll make sure to include terms like "allowing," "prohibits," "vindicate," "violated," and others to maintain the moral framing. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered.

Finally, I'll end the summary with the required tokens. I'll double-check to ensure all important details are included and that the moral language is preserved accurately.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm WILL argues the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The lawsuit claims the policy enables students to socially transition without parental consent, circumventing their involvement in pivotal decisions affecting their children's health and future. The school district's policy, announced in 2018, affirms students' self-designated gender identities and strives to disrupt the gender binary, allowing students to pick new names and pronouns regardless of parental permission. The parents argue this violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it hides their children's gender struggles from them. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its policy supporting transgender and nonbinary students. END OF SUMMARY.
