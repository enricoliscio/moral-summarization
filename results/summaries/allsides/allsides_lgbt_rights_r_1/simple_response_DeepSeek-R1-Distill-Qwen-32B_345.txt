Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author presented. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, there are 14 Wisconsin parents suing the Madison Metropolitan School District because the district allows teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without informing the parents. The lawsuit was filed by a conservative law firm, WILL. The key arguments are about the parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and that the school policy violates due process by not involving parents in gender transition decisions. The policy from 2018 allows students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, which the parents argue interferes with their rights and religious beliefs.

I should highlight the legal and moral aspects. The moral framing emphasizes parental rights and religious freedom. I need to make sure the summary reflects that the parents feel their rights are being violated by the school's approach to gender identity.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, the school district's policy, the constitutional arguments, and the parents' religious beliefs. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral stance presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm WILL filed the lawsuit, arguing that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The MMSD policy, in place since 2018, permits students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, a move the parents claim circumvents their rights and religious beliefs, as they believe gender is binary and God-intended. The lawsuit also contends that hiding students' gender struggles from parents denies them the chance to provide necessary support or professional help. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its commitment to affirming students' gender identities. The case highlights a clash between parental rights and school policies supporting gender diversity. END OF SUMMARY.
