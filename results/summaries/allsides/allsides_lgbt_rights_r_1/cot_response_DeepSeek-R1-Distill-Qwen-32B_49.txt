Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about a lawsuit filed by 14 Wisconsin parents against a school district for their policy on gender identity without parental notification. The parents, represented by a conservative law firm, argue that the policy violates their constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing. The school district's policy allows students to choose their preferred name and pronouns without parental consent, which the parents find unconstitutional. They also mention religious freedom and the impact on their children's health.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a value judgment or ethical implication. I'll go through the article and pick out terms like "unconstitutional," "fundamental," "constitutional right," "pivotal decision," "health and future," "socially transition," "gender identity," "gender binary," "due process clause," "parental rights," "life-altering decisions," "gender dysphoria," "compelling government interest," "religious freedom guarantee," "God intended," "male and female," "right to guide," "professional help," "urgently need," "conscience," "profound impact," "fundamental right," "private matter," "public institution," "parental guidance," "best interests," "childhood development," "mental health," "gender identity," "gender dysphoria," "social transition," "preferred name," "pronouns," "gender identity," "gender binary," "affirming," "self-designated," "gender identity," "disrupt," "gender binary," "right to choose," "gender," "name," "pronouns," "school district," "policy," "parental notification," "parental consent," "name change," "gender identity," "preferred name," "pronouns," "parental permission," "district systems," "constitutional rights," "parental rights," "gender dysphoria," "professional help," "urgently need," "religious freedom," "God intended," "male and female," "right to guide," "according to their religious beliefs."

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit details, the policy in question, the parents' arguments about constitutional rights and religious freedom, and the school district's stance. I'll ensure the summary captures the moral concerns highlighted by both the parents and the school district.

**SUMMARY:**  
A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) for its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The parents, represented by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argue that the policy violates their constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and infringes on their religious freedom. They claim the policy enables children to socially transition without parental involvement, which they view as a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future. The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it prohibits parents from knowing if their child is experiencing gender dysphoria. The parents argue that there is no compelling government interest in withholding this information and that the policy interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The school district, however, stands by its commitment to affirming students' gender identities and disrupting the gender binary. The case highlights the tension between parental rights and the school's role in supporting transgender and nonbinary students. END OF SUMMARY.
