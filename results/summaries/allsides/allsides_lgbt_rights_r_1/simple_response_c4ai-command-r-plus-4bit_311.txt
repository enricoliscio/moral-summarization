SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents is fighting for their right to direct the upbringing of their children, including their beliefs about gender, by suing their local school district. The Madison Metropolitan School District's policy, which allows students to choose their gender identity and pronouns without parental notification or consent, is at the center of the lawsuit. The parents argue that the policy violates their constitutional rights to due process and religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male or female. The school district's stance on transgender and nonbinary students, which includes providing books and lessons that disrupt the gender binary, is seen by the parents as an overreach of the school's authority and a circumvention of their parental rights. They believe that the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through important and potentially life-altering decisions, including providing necessary professional help. The lawsuit aims to uphold the parents' fundamental right to raise their children according to their own values and to be involved in pivotal decisions that affect their children's lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
