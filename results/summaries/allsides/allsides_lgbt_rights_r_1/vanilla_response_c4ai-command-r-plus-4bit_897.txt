SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing students to use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 14 anonymous parents, arguing that the district's policy violates their constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district will affirm each student's self-designated gender identity and strive to disrupt the gender binary. While legal name changes require parental consent, the policy allows students to choose new names and pronouns at school without parental permission. The parents argue that this violates the state constitution's due process clause and interferes with their right to guide their children through important decisions. They also claim that the policy infringes on their religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
