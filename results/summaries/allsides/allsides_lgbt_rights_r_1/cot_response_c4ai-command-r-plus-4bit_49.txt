SUMMARY: 
A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification. The lawsuit argues that the district's policy is *unconstitutional* and *violates* parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. It enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental consent, which the parents argue is a *pivotal* decision that should be made by parents. The policy also goes against the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom *guarantee*, as the parents believe God *intended* humans to be male and female. The school district *stands* by its guidance, but the parents assert that keeping them in the dark about their children's gender struggles *interferes* with their *right* to provide guidance and support in accordance with their religious beliefs. The lawsuit seeks to *vindicate* parents' rights and challenges the district's decision to *adopt* policies that *violate* constitutionally protected parental rights.
