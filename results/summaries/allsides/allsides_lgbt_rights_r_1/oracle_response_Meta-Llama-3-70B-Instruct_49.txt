SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has taken action to vindicate their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, filing a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, violating the parents' right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The lawsuit argues that the policy circumvents parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future, and interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The parents believe the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it allows students to pick new names and pronouns without parental permission, and prohibits teachers and staff from informing parents about their children's gender struggles.

END OF SUMMARY.
