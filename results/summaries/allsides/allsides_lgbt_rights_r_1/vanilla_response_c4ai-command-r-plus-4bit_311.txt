SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing students to use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 14 anonymous parents, arguing that the district's policy violates their constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, implemented in 2018, enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school, including using preferred names and pronouns, without parental notification or consent. While legal name changes in official records require parental consent, the policy allows students to choose new names and pronouns for use within the school setting. The parents argue that the policy interferes with their right to guide their children through important decisions and provide necessary support. They also claim it violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
