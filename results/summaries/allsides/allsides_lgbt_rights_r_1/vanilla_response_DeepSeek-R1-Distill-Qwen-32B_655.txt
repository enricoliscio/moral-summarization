Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on. 

The article talks about 14 Wisconsin parents who filed a lawsuit against their local school district. The reason is the district's policy allowing teachers to use students' preferred gender identities without notifying the parents. The law firm, WILL, which is conservative, filed the lawsuit. The parents argue that this policy is unconstitutional because it stops teachers from informing parents if their kids want to switch genders. They say it's a violation of their right to direct their children's upbringing.

The school district's policy, from 2018, says students can choose their preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. The district is committed to affirming each student's gender identity and even tries to disrupt the gender binary through educational materials. The parents are upset because they believe the policy interferes with their constitutional right to raise their kids according to their beliefs. They also argue it violates religious freedom, as they believe humans should be male or female as per their religious views.

The district hasn't been served the lawsuit yet and can't comment, but they support their policy. The lawsuit claims that keeping parents in the dark about their children's gender issues is wrong and could prevent parents from providing necessary help.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: who filed the lawsuit, the reason, the school district's policy, the parents' arguments about constitutional and religious rights, and the district's stance. I'll make sure to mention that the parents argue the policy violates their rights and the district's commitment to gender identity.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the lawsuit details, then explain the policy, the parents' arguments, and the district's response. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and just write the summary clearly. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows well. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and names without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing and raises religious freedom concerns. The district's 2018 policy permits students to choose their preferred names and pronouns without parental consent, aiming to affirm gender identity and disrupt the gender binary. Parents claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide necessary support. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its commitment to supporting transgender and nonbinary students. END OF SUMMARY.
