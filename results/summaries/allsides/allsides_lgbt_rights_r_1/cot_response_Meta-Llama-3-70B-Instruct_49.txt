SUMMARY:
A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) for its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first. The parents argue that the policy is unconstitutional because it prohibits teachers and staff from informing parents that their children want to switch sexes, violating their fundamental and constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, which the parents believe interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help their children may urgently need. The parents also argue that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. END OF SUMMARY.
