Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the query carefully. They provided an article about a lawsuit filed by 14 Wisconsin parents against the Madison Metropolitan School District. The issue is the school's policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity without notifying parents.

First, I need to identify the main points. The lawsuit is filed by WILL, a conservative law firm, on behalf of the parents. The policy in question allows students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent. The parents argue this violates their constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing and due process. They also mention religious freedom concerns, as they believe in traditional gender roles based on their faith.

The school district's policy, introduced in 2018, supports affirming each student's gender identity and disrupting the gender binary through educational materials. The district hasn't commented yet but stands by their stance.

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: who filed the lawsuit, the reason, the policy details, the parents' arguments, and the district's response. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual.

I'll start by stating the lawsuit details, then explain the policy, followed by the parents' arguments, and end with the district's position. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the information provided.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing and due process. The parents claim the policy enables children to socially transition without parental involvement, potentially interfering with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The MMSD policy, introduced in 2018, allows students to choose new names and pronouns regardless of parental consent, while teachers and staff must use these chosen identities. The parents also argue the policy infringes on their religious freedom, as they believe in traditional gender roles. The district has not yet commented on the lawsuit but supports its transgender and nonbinary student guidelines. END OF SUMMARY.
