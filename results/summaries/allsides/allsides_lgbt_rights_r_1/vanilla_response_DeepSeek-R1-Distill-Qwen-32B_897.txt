Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. 

So, 14 Wisconsin parents sued a school district because they don't like the policy that allows teachers to use students' preferred gender identities without notifying the parents. The law firm involved is WILL, a conservative group. The lawsuit says the policy is unconstitutional because it stops parents from knowing if their kids want to switch genders. They argue this violates parents' rights to raise their kids as they see fit.

The school district's policy, from 2018, lets students use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. They're committed to affirming each student's gender identity and disrupting the gender binary through educational materials. The parents are upset because they feel this interferes with their right to guide their children, especially regarding health and future decisions. They also mention religious beliefs, saying the district's actions go against their faith-based views on gender.

The district hasn't responded yet but stands by their policy. The lawsuit claims the policy violates due process and religious freedom. They argue that parents should be informed about their children's gender dysphoria so they can provide necessary help.

So, the summary should include the main points: who sued, why, the policy details, the constitutional arguments, and the district's stance. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the essential elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by conservative law firm WILL, claims the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and education. The MMSD policy, introduced in 2018, permits students to choose their preferred names and pronouns at school, even without parental consent, while also affirming gender identities and promoting gender inclusivity. The parents argue this violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions and align with their religious beliefs. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but has defended its policy. END OF SUMMARY.
