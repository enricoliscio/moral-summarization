SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing students to use preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, argues that the district's policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district affirms each student's self-designated gender identity and strives to disrupt the gender binary. While legal name changes require parental consent, the policy allows students to choose new names and pronouns at school without parental involvement. The parents argue that this interferes with their right to guide their children according to their beliefs and religious views on gender. They also assert that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet commented on the lawsuit as it has not been served.
END OF SUMMARY.
