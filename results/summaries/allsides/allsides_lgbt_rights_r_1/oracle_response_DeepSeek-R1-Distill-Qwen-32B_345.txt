Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they're a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical aspects highlighted in the text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 14 Wisconsin parents suing a school district over a policy allowing students to use preferred gender identities without parental notification. The school district's policy is seen as violating parents' rights, especially their constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing.

I notice the author uses specific morally charged words like "allowing," "prohibits," "violated," "vindicate," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit details, the school's policy, the parents' arguments, and the district's stance. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I'll start by mentioning the lawsuit and the conservative law firm involved. Then, outline the policy that allows students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent. Highlight the parents' claims about violating due process and religious freedom. Conclude with the district's support for their policy.

I need to keep each sentence concise and ensure the moral framing is clear. Avoiding technical jargon and keeping the language accessible while preserving the ethical implications is key.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll format it correctly with the tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The district's 2018 policy enables students to socially transition at school without parental consent, which the parents claim circumvents their involvement in pivotal decisions affecting their children's health and future. The policy also aims to disrupt the gender binary through educational materials, which the parents argue violates their religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male or female. The lawsuit alleges that hiding students' gender struggles from parents interferes with their right to provide necessary professional help and violates the state constitution's due process and religious freedom guarantees. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its policy. END OF SUMMARY.
