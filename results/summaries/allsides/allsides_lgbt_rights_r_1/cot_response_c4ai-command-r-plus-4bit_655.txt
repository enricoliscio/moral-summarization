SUMMARY:
* * *
A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental consent. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the district's policy violates the fundamental and constitutional rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.

According to the parents, the policy, which was announced in 2018, enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental involvement. While legal name changes require parental consent, the policy allows students to choose new names and pronouns at school with the support of teachers and staff, regardless of parental permission. The parents argue that this policy interferes with their right to guide their children through major decisions and provide necessary support, particularly in cases of gender dysphoria.

Furthermore, the lawsuit contends that the district's stance on gender identity violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantees. The parents assert their belief in God's intention for distinct male and female genders and view the district's policy as an infringement on their right to raise their children according to their religious beliefs. The school district, however, maintains its guidance on transgender and nonbinary students, asserting that it stands by its commitment to affirming each student's self-designated gender identity. 

END OF SUMMARY.
