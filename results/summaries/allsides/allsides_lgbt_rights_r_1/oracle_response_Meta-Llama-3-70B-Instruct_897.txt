SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has taken action to vindicate their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, filing a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) for its policy that prohibits teachers from notifying them when their children want to switch sexes. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, violating parents' constitutional right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The district's policy allows students to pick new names and pronouns, which teachers and staff must refer to, even without parental permission. The parents argue that this policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help they may urgently need. By keeping parents in the dark, the district is circumventing parental involvement and disrupting the parents' ability to raise their children according to their religious beliefs.

END OF SUMMARY.
