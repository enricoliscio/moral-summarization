Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, 14 parents in Wisconsin sued their school district because the district allows teachers to use students' preferred gender identities without informing the parents first. The law firm involved is WILL, a conservative group. The lawsuit says the policy is unconstitutional because it stops teachers from telling parents if their kids want to change their gender at school.

The school district's policy from 2018 lets students use preferred names and pronouns without parental permission. They even have to use these names in school, even if they aren't legally changed. The parents argue this violates their right to direct their children's upbringing and their religious freedom. They believe gender is binary as per their religious beliefs.

The district hasn't responded yet but stands by their policy. The lawsuit also claims that hiding kids' gender issues from parents stops them from providing necessary help, like professional support.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the lawsuit, the policy, the parents' arguments about constitutional rights, and the district's stance. Keep it concise and cover all key points without extra details.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues the policy violates constitutional rights, including parents' right to direct their children's upbringing and religious freedom. The MMSD policy, implemented in 2018, permits students to choose their preferred names and pronouns at school without parental consent, while legally changing a child's name requires parental approval. The parents claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through significant decisions and access necessary support, such as professional help for gender dysphoria. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its transgender and nonbinary student guidelines. END OF SUMMARY.
