SUMMARY:
A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District, arguing that its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first is unconstitutional. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, violating parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. The parents argue that the policy circumvents parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future, and interferes with their right to guide their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate parents' constitutional right to raise their children according to their beliefs. END OF SUMMARY.
