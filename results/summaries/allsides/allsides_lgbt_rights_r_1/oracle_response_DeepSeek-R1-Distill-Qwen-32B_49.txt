Alright, so I've got this query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 14 Wisconsin parents suing a school district over a policy that allows students to use their preferred gender identity without notifying parents. The conservative law firm, WILL, is representing them. The lawsuit argues that the policy violates constitutional rights by not involving parents in their children's gender transition decisions.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They listed a bunch like "allowing," "notifying," "prohibits," etc. My summary should include as many of these as possible to maintain the original moral perspective.

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: who is suing, why, the specific policy details, and the arguments made by both sides. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the conflict accurately.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. So, I'll focus on the essential points without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll start by stating the lawsuit, mention the conservative law firm, outline the policy, and then present both the plaintiffs' and the school district's positions.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the moral arguments presented in the original article. This way, the summary not only informs but also preserves the original framing, making it clear why the parents are upset and what the school district is defending.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) filed the lawsuit, arguing that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing. The lawsuit claims the policy enables children to socially transition without parental involvement, circumventing their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The MMSD policy, announced in 2018, permits students to choose their preferred names and pronouns, even without parental consent, and requires staff to refer to them by these chosen identities. The parents argue this violates due process and religious freedom guarantees, as it hides their children's gender struggles from them, interfering with their ability to provide guidance and support. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its policy, which aims to affirm students' gender identities and disrupt the gender binary. END OF SUMMARY.
