SUMMARY: 
A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification. The parents argue that the policy violates their fundamental and constitutional *right* to direct the upbringing of their children. The lawsuit alleges that the district's transgender policy is *unconstitutional* because it prohibits teachers from informing parents about their children's desired gender transition. The policy allows students to choose new names and pronouns at school without parental consent, and requires district staff to refer to students by these chosen names and pronouns. According to the parents, this *violates* their *right* to raise their children according to their own *beliefs* and interferes with their ability to provide guidance and professional help. It also goes against the state constitution's *due process* clause and religious *freedom guarantee*. The district, however, stands by its guidance on transgender and nonbinary students, stating that it affirms each student's self-designated gender identity. The lawsuit seeks to uphold parents' *involvement* in their children's pivotal decisions and to protect their *right* to direct their upbringing.
END OF SUMMARY.
