Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, there's a group of 14 Wisconsin parents suing a school district because the district allows teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without informing the parents first. The lawsuit is filed by a conservative law firm, WILL. They argue that the policy is unconstitutional because it violates parents' rights to direct their children's upbringing. The policy from 2018 allows students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, even though changing legal names requires parental permission.

The parents' main points are that the policy interferes with their constitutional right to raise their children and that it hides information about their children's gender identity, which might prevent them from providing necessary help. They also mention religious beliefs, stating that the district's actions interfere with their ability to guide their children according to their faith.

The school district, on the other hand, stands by its policy, which aims to affirm each student's gender identity and disrupt the gender binary through educational materials. They haven't commented yet since they haven't been served the lawsuit.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements: the lawsuit, the conservative law firm, the constitutional arguments, the policy details, the parents' religious beliefs, and the district's stance. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective presented in the article.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the lawsuit, mention the law firm, the parents' argument about constitutional rights, the policy's specifics, the parents' belief about gender and religion, the district's response, and the lawsuit's claims about health and religious interference.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions or additional information beyond what's in the article. Make sure it's concise and captures the moral framing, emphasizing the conflict between parental rights and the school's inclusive policy.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) filed the lawsuit, arguing that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and raises concerns about religious freedom. The parents claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through significant life decisions, including addressing potential gender dysphoria. The district's 2018 policy permits students to choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, while also aiming to affirm gender identities and disrupt the gender binary through educational materials. The lawsuit asserts that hiding this information from parents infringes on their rights and religious beliefs, as many parents believe in a binary view of gender based on their faith. The district has not yet commented on the lawsuit but stands by its inclusive policy. END OF SUMMARY.
