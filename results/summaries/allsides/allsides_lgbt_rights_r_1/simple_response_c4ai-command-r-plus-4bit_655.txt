SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against a local school district, alleging that its policy of allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification is unconstitutional and violates their religious freedom. The conservative law firm, Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 14 anonymous parents, arguing that the Madison Metropolitan School District's (MMSD) policy circumvents parental involvement in decisions affecting their children's health and future. While the district requires parental consent for legal name changes, its policy allows students to use chosen names and pronouns without parental permission. The parents argue that this interferes with their right to raise their children according to their beliefs and religious values, which state that God intended humans to be male and female. They also believe that the policy interferes with their ability to provide necessary professional help and guidance to their children. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.

END OF SUMMARY.
