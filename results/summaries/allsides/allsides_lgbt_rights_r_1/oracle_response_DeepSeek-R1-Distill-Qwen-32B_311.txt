Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also included a list of morally framed words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 14 Wisconsin parents suing a school district over a policy allowing students to use preferred gender identities without parental notification. The school district's policy is seen as violating parents' rights, particularly their constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing. The parents argue it's unconstitutional and interferes with their ability to guide their children, especially regarding health and religious beliefs.

Now, I need to identify the key elements: the lawsuit, the parties involved, the policy details, and the moral arguments. The morally framed words include "allowing," "notifying," "prohibits," "action," "vindicate," "violated," "adopting," "circumvent," "enables," "transition," "policy," "announced," "says," "committed," "affirming," "strive," "disrupt," "stating," "allows," "pick," "refer," "chosen," "adopted," "violate," "decisions," "keeping," "hide," "interferes."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start by stating the lawsuit, mention the parents and the law firm, then outline the policy and its implications. Highlight the arguments about violating rights, circumventing parental involvement, and the impact on health and religious beliefs.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and concise, sticking to the moral framing without adding any personal opinions. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered with the appropriate moral terms.

I'll start with the lawsuit, then the policy details, the parents' arguments about constitutional rights, the school's stance, and the broader implications. Make sure each sentence uses the morally charged words where relevant. Finally, check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) for its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing. The parents claim the policy enables students to socially transition without parental consent, circumventing their involvement in pivotal decisions affecting their children's health and future. The MMSD policy, announced in 2018, allows students to pick new names and pronouns regardless of parental permission, requiring teachers and staff to refer to them by their chosen identities. The parents argue this violates the state constitution's due process clause, protecting their right to raise children according to their beliefs. They also claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide necessary professional help. The lawsuit further alleges that hiding students' gender struggles violates religious freedom guarantees, as the parents believe God intended humans to be male or female. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but stands by its policy. END OF SUMMARY.
