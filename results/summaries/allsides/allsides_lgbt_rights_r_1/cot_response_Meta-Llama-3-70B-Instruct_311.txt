SUMMARY:
A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first. The parents argue that this policy is unconstitutional and violates their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. They claim that the policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, circumventing parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future. The parents believe that the policy interferes with their right to guide their children according to their religious beliefs, and that the district's choice to hide students' gender struggles is a violation of their religious freedom. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate parents' constitutional right to raise their children according to their beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
