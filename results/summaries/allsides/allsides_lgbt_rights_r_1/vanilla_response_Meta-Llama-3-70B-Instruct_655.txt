SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying parents. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent. The parents argue that the policy violates their constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children and interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions. They also claim that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. The lawsuit alleges that the district's policy is unconstitutional and seeks to vindicate parents' fundamental right to raise their children according to their beliefs.

END OF SUMMARY.
