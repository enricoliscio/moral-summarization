SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) for its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying parents first. The parents argue that the policy is unconstitutional, violating their fundamental right to direct their children's upbringing. The policy enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, which the parents believe interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help they may need. The lawsuit also argues that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as the parents believe God intended humans to be male and female. The parents are seeking to vindicate their constitutional right to raise their children according to their beliefs.

END OF SUMMARY.
