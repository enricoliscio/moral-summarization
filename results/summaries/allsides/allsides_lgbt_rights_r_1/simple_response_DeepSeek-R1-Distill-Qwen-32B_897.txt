Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the lawsuit in Wisconsin. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The main points are: 14 Wisconsin parents sued the Madison school district because the district allows teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without notifying the parents. The conservative law firm, WILL, filed the lawsuit. The parents argue that the policy violates their constitutional rights to direct their children's upbringing. The district's policy from 2018 lets students choose their names and pronouns without parental consent, while legally changing the name requires parental permission. The lawsuit mentions the policy violates due process and religious freedom. The district supports their policy but hasn't responded yet.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral arguments, like the parents' rights and the religious angle. I should also mention the district's stance on affirming gender identity. Let me structure this clearly, starting with the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, the policy, and the arguments from both sides. I'll keep it concise but include all necessary details.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and interferes with their ability to provide guidance and support. The lawsuit claims the policy, which permits students to choose their names and pronouns regardless of parental consent, circumvents parental involvement in critical decisions about their children's health and future. The district's policy, introduced in 2018, aims to affirm students' self-designated gender identities and disrupt the gender binary, but parents argue this infringes on their religious freedom, as they believe gender is binary and assigned by God. The lawsuit also contends that hiding students' gender struggles from parents prevents them from seeking necessary professional help. The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit but reaffirms its commitment to supporting transgender and nonbinary students. END OF SUMMARY.
