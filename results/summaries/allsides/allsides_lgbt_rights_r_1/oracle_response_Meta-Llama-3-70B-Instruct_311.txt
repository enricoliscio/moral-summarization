SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has taken legal action to vindicate their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, alleging that the Madison Metropolitan School District's (MMSD) transgender policy violates the state constitution. The policy, adopted in 2018, prohibits teachers and staff from notifying parents when their children want to switch sexes, enabling children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent. The parents argue that this policy circumvents parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future, violating their right to raise their children according to their beliefs. By keeping parents in the dark about their children's sexuality, the policy interferes with parents' right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help they may urgently need. The parents also claim that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as it hides students' gender struggles and interferes with their right to guide their children in accordance with their religious beliefs.
