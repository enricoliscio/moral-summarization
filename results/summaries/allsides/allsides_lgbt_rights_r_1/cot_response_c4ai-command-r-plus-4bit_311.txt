SUMMARY:
A group of Wisconsin parents is suing their local school district over a policy that allows teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the district's policy violates parents' fundamental and constitutional right to direct the *upbringing* of their children. The policy, which was announced in 2018, allows students to use preferred names and pronouns at school without parental permission, and the district is committed to *affirming* each student's self-designated gender identity. 

The parents argue that the policy *violates* their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions, including those related to gender identity. They believe that the school district should not make decisions *reserved* for parents and that keeping them in the dark about their children's gender struggles *interferes* with their ability to provide necessary support and help. The lawsuit also raises concerns about religious freedom, as the parents believe that God intended humans to be male and female. 

The school district stands by its guidance on transgender and nonbinary students, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit and cannot comment until they have reviewed it. This case highlights the ongoing debate between parental rights and the support and protection of transgender students in schools.
