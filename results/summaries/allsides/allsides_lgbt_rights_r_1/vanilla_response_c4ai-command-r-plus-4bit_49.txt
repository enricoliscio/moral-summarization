SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing students to use their preferred names and pronouns without parental consent. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, argues that the district's policy is unconstitutional and violates parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district affirms each student's self-designated gender identity and allows students to choose new names and pronouns without parental permission. The parents argue that this policy interferes with their right to guide their children according to their religious beliefs and that it could prevent them from providing necessary support and professional help. They also claim that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
