SUMMARY:
A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing teachers to address their children by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying them first. The parents argue that the policy is unconstitutional and violates their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. They claim that the policy circumvents parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future. The policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, which the parents believe interferes with their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help their children may urgently need. The lawsuit also argues that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as the parents believe God intended humans to be male and female.
