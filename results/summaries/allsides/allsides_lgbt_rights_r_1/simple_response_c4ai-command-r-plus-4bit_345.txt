SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District, alleging that its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification is unconstitutional and violates their rights to direct their children's upbringing. The conservative law firm, Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 14 anonymous parents, arguing that the district's policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without their parents' knowledge or consent. The policy, implemented in 2018, states that the district affirms each student's self-designated gender identity and strives to disrupt the gender binary. While legal name changes require parental consent, students can choose new names and pronouns at school without it. The parents argue that this policy interferes with their right to guide their children according to their beliefs and religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. They also assert that being kept in the dark about their children's gender struggles deprives them of the opportunity to provide necessary guidance and professional help. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
