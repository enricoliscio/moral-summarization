SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District, alleging that its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without parental notification is unconstitutional. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental consent or notice. The parents argue that this policy violates their fundamental right to direct their children's upbringing, as guaranteed by the state constitution. They claim that the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide necessary professional help. The parents also argue that the policy violates their religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate parents' rights and ensure that they are involved in pivotal decisions affecting their children's health and future.

END OF SUMMARY.
