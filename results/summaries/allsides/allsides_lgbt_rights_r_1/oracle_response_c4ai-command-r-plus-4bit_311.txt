SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, alleges that the district's policy is unconstitutional and violates parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district is committed to affirming each student's self-designated gender identity and disrupting the gender binary. It allows students to choose new names and pronouns without parental permission, and requires teachers and staff to refer to students by their chosen names and pronouns. The parents argue that this policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and interferes with their right to guide their children according to their religious beliefs. They believe that the district's decision to hide students' gender struggles from parents violates their constitutional and religious rights as parents. The lawsuit seeks to vindicate parents' rights and argues that the district should not make decisions that override parental authority. The district, however, stands by its guidance on transgender and nonbinary students.
END OF SUMMARY.
