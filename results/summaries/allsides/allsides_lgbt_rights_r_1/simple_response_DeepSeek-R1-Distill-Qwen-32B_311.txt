Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key moral arguments presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A group of parents in Wisconsin filed a lawsuit against a school district for its policy on gender identity. The policy allows students to choose their preferred name and pronouns without parental notification. The lawsuit claims this violates constitutional rights of parents to direct their children's upbringing.

I should highlight the moral issues here. The parents argue that the school is overstepping by making decisions about their children's gender identity without their knowledge. They believe this interferes with their right to guide their children, especially concerning religious beliefs about gender.

I need to make sure the summary captures the constitutional and religious aspects. Also, the school's stance on affirming gender identity and disrupting the gender binary is important to include as the opposing moral view.

I'll structure the summary to first state the lawsuit, then the parents' arguments about constitutional rights and religious freedom, and finally the school's defense. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring it reflects the moral framing from both sides.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear. Make sure to mention the key points: the policy, the lawsuit's claims, the parents' beliefs, and the school's commitment to inclusivity.

Double-checking to ensure all main points are covered without bias, just presenting the moral arguments as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns at school without parental notification. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), argues that the policy violates parents' constitutional right to direct their children's upbringing and raises concerns about religious freedom. The parents claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through potentially life-altering decisions, such as addressing gender dysphoria, and conflicts with their belief that gender is binary and defined by God. The school district, which adopted the policy in 2018, maintains that it is committed to affirming students' self-designated gender identities and disrupting the gender binary through inclusive practices. The lawsuit asserts that the policy's secrecy about students' gender struggles undermines parental rights and religious freedoms, while the district defends its approach as a matter of inclusivity and student well-being.
