SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has taken legal action to vindicate their fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, alleging that the Madison Metropolitan School District's (MMSD) transgender policy violates their constitutional rights. The policy, adopted in 2018, allows teachers to address students by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying parents, effectively circumventing parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting their children's health and future. The parents argue that the policy enables children to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, violating their right to guide their children through life-altering decisions. The lawsuit claims that the policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantee, as it interferes with parents' right to raise their children according to their beliefs. The parents demand that the district respect their right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, rather than allowing the district to hide crucial information from them. END OF SUMMARY.
