SUMMARY: A group of Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred gender identity without notifying parents. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, alleges that the district's policy is unconstitutional and violates parents' fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. The policy, announced in 2018, states that the district is committed to affirming each student's self-designated gender identity and disrupting the gender binary. It enables students to pick new names and pronouns without parental permission, and teachers are required to refer to students by their chosen names and pronouns. The parents argue that this policy violates the state constitution's due process clause and interferes with their religious freedom, as they believe God intended humans to be male and female. They also claim that the policy keeps them in the dark about their children's struggles with gender identity, hindering their ability to provide necessary guidance and support. The school district stands by its guidance, but has not yet been served with the lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
