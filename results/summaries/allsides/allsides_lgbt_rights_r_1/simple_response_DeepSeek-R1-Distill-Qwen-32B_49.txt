Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about a lawsuit filed by 14 Wisconsin parents against the Madison Metropolitan School District. The main issue is the district's policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without informing the parents. The conservative law firm, WILL, is representing the parents, arguing that this policy violates constitutional rights related to parental involvement in their children's upbringing.

I should note the key points: the lawsuit's purpose, the policy details, the constitutional arguments, and the district's stance. It's important to highlight the moral framing, which revolves around parental rights and religious beliefs. The parents argue that the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children, especially concerning gender dysphoria and religious values.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements. I'll structure it to first introduce the lawsuit, then explain the policy, followed by the legal arguments, and conclude with the district's response and the parents' beliefs.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, making sure the moral perspective is clear. Let me draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring clarity.

SUMMARY: A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing students to use their preferred gender identity and pronouns without parental notification. The conservative law firm WILL argues that the policy violates constitutional rights, as it undermines parents' fundamental role in their children's upbringing. The lawsuit claims the policy enables children to socially transition at school without parental consent, infringing on the state constitution's due process clause and religious freedom guarantees. The parents assert that withholding information about their children's gender identity deprives them of the ability to guide their children through critical decisions and provide necessary support, including professional help for gender dysphoria. The district maintains its commitment to affirming students' gender identities but has not yet responded to the lawsuit. The parents argue that their religious beliefs, which view gender as binary and divinely ordained, are being disregarded by the district's policy. END OF SUMMARY.
