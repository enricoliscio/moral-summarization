SUMMARY:

A group of 14 Wisconsin parents has filed a lawsuit against the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) over its policy allowing teachers to address students by their preferred "gender identity" without notifying parents. The policy, adopted in 2018, enables students to socially transition to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent. The parents argue that the policy is unconstitutional, violating their right to direct their children's upbringing and make decisions about their health and future. They claim the policy interferes with their ability to guide their children through life-altering decisions and provide professional help if needed. The lawsuit also argues that the policy violates the state constitution's religious freedom guarantee, as the parents believe God intended humans to be male and female.

END OF SUMMARY.
