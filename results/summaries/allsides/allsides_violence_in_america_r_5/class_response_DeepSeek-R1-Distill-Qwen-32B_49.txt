Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the murder of Marines in Tennessee, the political reactions, especially from Republicans blaming Obama, and the debate over terrorism and gun policies.

I need to highlight the moral terms like "murder," "heartbreaking," "terrorism," and "attacks." Also, include the political angle where Republicans are using this for the campaign.

I should mention the gunman's background and the FBI's classification as domestic terrorism. Also, touch on the ongoing debates about gun policies at military facilities and the broader context of terrorism threats.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key events and the moral language used. Make sure to include the political divide and the implications for the presidential campaign.

Let me structure it: start with the event, then the political reactions, the investigation details, and the broader implications. Use the moral words to frame each section.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking," urging Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama for what they termed domestic terrorism, framing the shooting as part of the 2016 presidential campaign. Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the "evil" of radical Islamic terrorism, arguing it is "at war with us." The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and classified the attack as domestic terrorism. While authorities investigated potential ties to al Qaeda or ISIS, Rep. Adam Schiff emphasized the need to explore online propaganda or extremist influence. The threat from ISIS is growing, with federal charges filed against 62 individuals for planning attacks or supporting the group. The shooting echoed earlier incidents under Obamaâ€™s tenure, including the Fort Hood attack, which the administration labeled workplace violence. Lawmakers debated whether radicalized Muslims or white supremacists posed a greater threat, highlighting the ongoing struggle to counter terrorism and extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
