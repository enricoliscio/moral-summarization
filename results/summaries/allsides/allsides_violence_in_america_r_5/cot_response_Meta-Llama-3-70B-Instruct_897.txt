SUMMARY:
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and pleaded for Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for the "domestic terrorism" attack. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be "terrorism" and that Mr. Obama needs to confront the "evil" of "jihadists". The shooting reignited the debate over guns at military facilities and the threat of "radical Islamic terrorism". The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen. The attack is a reminder that there are people in America who are intent on striking from within, driven by a "twisted ideology" that promotes "unconscionable acts of violence and hate". The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland.
