SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking," asking Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for what investigators called domestic terrorism, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not acknowledging the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Terrorism is shaping up to be a major part of the 2016 presidential debate, and Obama's policies will be at the center. The shooting also sparked a debate about the policy prohibiting troops from being armed at military facilities. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but cautioned against speculating on his motives. Authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism, and investigations are ongoing into possible ties with extremist groups. The threat of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the U.S. is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people this year alone. This incident also highlights the debate over how the government addresses violent extremists, with some arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims.
