SUMMARY: Four Marines were murdered in Tennessee, and Republicans were quick to blame President Obama and his administration for what investigators called an act of domestic terrorism. This incident has become part of the 2016 presidential campaign, with Louisiana Governor and GOP nominee Bobby Jindal criticizing Obama for not addressing the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Terrorism is expected to be a significant issue in the presidential debate, with Obama's policies likely to come under scrutiny. The shooting has also sparked a debate about the policy prohibiting troops from carrying arms at military facilities. Obama, however, refrained from politicizing the tragedy and called for Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the shooting is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism. This incident adds to the growing list of terror plots or attacks in the U.S. linked to the Islamic State or radical Islam. The threat of lone-wolf attacks and the rise of white supremacist and anti-government extremist groups are also causing concern. Governor Jindal criticized the Obama administration's handling of previous attacks, such as the Fort Hood shooting, which was labeled as workplace violence. Lawmakers are debating how the government should address violent extremists, with some questioning the focus of current efforts.
