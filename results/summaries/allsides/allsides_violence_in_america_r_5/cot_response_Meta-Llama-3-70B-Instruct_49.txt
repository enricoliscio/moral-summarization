SUMMARY:
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and pleaded for Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for what investigators termed domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be terrorism and that Mr. Obama needs to confront the "evil" of jihadists. The governor emphasized that "radical Islamic terrorism" is at war with the US and that the White House needs to be "honest" about it. The shooting reignited the debate over guns at military facilities and terrorism is shaping up to be a major part of the presidential debate. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland. The shooting bore a resemblance to other gun attacks, and lawmakers are debating how the federal government confronts violent extremists. END OF SUMMARY.
