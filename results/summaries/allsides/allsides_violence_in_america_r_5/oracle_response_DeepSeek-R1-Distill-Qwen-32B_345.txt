Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article talks about the murder of Marines in Tennessee, which is a strong moral term. President Obama called it heartbreaking and asked people not to jump to conclusions. Republicans, especially Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama and labeled it terrorism. I need to include words like "murder," "terrorism," and "killing."

The article mentions that the shooting became part of the 2016 campaign, so I should note that. The FBI identified the gunman as Abdulazeez, who was a U.S. citizen. They treated it as domestic terrorism, which is another key term. The debate over gun policies at military facilities is also important, so I should include that.

Obama's response was to avoid political statements, focusing on condolences and waiting for more information. The article also connects this to past incidents like Fort Hood and the Benghazi attack, so I should mention those as well. The threat from ISIS is growing, with many charged individuals, including young men and foreign-born citizens. This shows a rising trend, so I should use "rising" or "growing."

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should structure it to cover the main points: the attack, political responses, FBI's investigation, Obama's stance, past incidents, and the broader threat context. I need to ensure all morally framed words are included where appropriate without making it too wordy.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "murder," "terrorism," "shooting," "killing," "danger," "threat," "attack," "rising," "domestic terrorism," "condolences," "investigation," "tragedy," "unconscionable acts," and "growing threat." I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions, while Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed him for the domestic terrorism incident. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a U.S. citizen, and labeled the attack as domestic terrorism. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, with lawmakers divided over whether radicalized Muslims or white supremacists pose a greater danger. Obama avoided political statements, expressing condolences and emphasizing the need for more information. The incident echoed past attacks, such as the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, which the Obama administration labeled workplace violence. The threat from groups like ISIS is growing, with 62 individuals charged in 2015 for supporting terrorism, including young men and foreign-born citizens. The attack underscored the need to counter the "evil" ideology driving unconscionable acts of violence and hate. END OF SUMMARY.
