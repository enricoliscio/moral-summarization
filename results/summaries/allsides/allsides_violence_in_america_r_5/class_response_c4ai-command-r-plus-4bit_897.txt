SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has sparked a debate about terrorism and gun control in military facilities. Republicans have criticized President Obama for his response to the attack, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal blaming the President for what investigators have called domestic terrorism. The shooting has brought attention to the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the Obama administration's policies regarding such incidents. The FBI has identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but has not yet determined his motives. Lawmakers are divided on how to confront violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims. The attack has also reignited discussions about the prohibition of troops from being armed at military facilities, with advocacy groups calling for a change in policy. President Obama has asked Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with an increasing number of young men being charged with planning attacks or providing support to the group.
END OF SUMMARY.
