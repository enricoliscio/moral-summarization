SUMMARY:

President Obama described the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the "evil" of jihadists, saying "radical Islam is at war with us." The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with many pointing to the growing threat of Islamic State. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and said he shot at a military recruiting center before killing the four Marines. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The incident highlights the reality of the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism and the need for vigilance in countering the evil ideology that drives violence and hate. The attack is a reminder that there are people in America who are intent on striking from within. END OF SUMMARY.
