SUMMARY:

President Obama called the "heartbreaking" murder of four Marines in Tennessee "domestic terrorism" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, were quick to blame Obama's policies for the tragedy, labeling it an act of "radical Islamic terrorism." Jindal stated that the White House needs to "wake up" and acknowledge the "evil" of jihadists. The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with many pointing to the growing threat posed by the Islamic State. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are investigating whether he had ties to extremist groups. Rep. Michael McCaul warned that there are people in America who are intent on "striking from within" and that the country must remain vigilant in countering the "evil and twisted ideology" that drives violence and hate.
