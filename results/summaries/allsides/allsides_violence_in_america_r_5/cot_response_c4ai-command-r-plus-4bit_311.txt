SUMMARY:
The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has sparked a political debate, with Republicans blaming President Obama for what investigators have called "domestic terrorism". The shooting has brought attention to the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the Obama administration's policies regarding it. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a GOP nominee, criticized the administration for not acknowledging the "evil" of jihadists and their "grotesque" actions. The shooting has also brought to light the issue of gun policies in military facilities, as the troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. President Obama, however, refrained from using the word "terror" in his statement and asked Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez and is investigating the incident as an "act of domestic terrorism". Lawmakers are debating how the government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat than radicalized Muslims. The threat of Islamic State and lone-wolf incidents is rising, and the Obama administration's handling of terrorism is expected to be a major part of the 2016 presidential debate.
