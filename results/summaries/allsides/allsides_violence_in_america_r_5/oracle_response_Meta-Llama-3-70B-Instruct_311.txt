SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. The shooting, which is being investigated as an "act of domestic terrorism," has sparked a debate over terrorism and gun control. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot at a military recruiting center before heading to a Navy operations support center, where he killed the four Marines before being killed himself. The attack has raised concerns about the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism, with authorities uncovering more U.S.-based terror plots or attacks in the first half of 2015 than in any year since 9/11. The incident has also reignited the debate over guns at military facilities, with some calling for a change in policy to allow troops to be armed. The president's policies on terrorism are expected to be a major part of the 2016 presidential debate.
