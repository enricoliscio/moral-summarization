SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has sparked a debate about terrorism and gun control in military facilities. Republicans have blamed President Obama for the shooting, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not acknowledging the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The FBI has identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez and is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. Early reports indicate that Abdulazeez was a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. This incident has brought attention to the rising threat of lone-wolf attacks and the dangers posed by jihadists. Lawmakers are debating how the government should confront violent extremists, with some arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims. The Obama administration's decision to label the 2009 Fort Hood shooting as workplace violence has been criticized by Jindal, who argues that the administration needs to acknowledge the existence of evil to defeat it. The shooting has also reignited the debate over gun control in military facilities, with troops at the Naval Reserve center prohibited from being armed. President Obama, however, has kept his remarks apolitical, expressing condolences and asking Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions.
END OF SUMMARY.
