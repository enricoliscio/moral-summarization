SUMMARY:
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and pleaded for Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for what investigators termed "domestic terrorism." Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be "terrorism" and that Mr. Obama needs to confront the "evil" of jihadists. The shooting has reignited the debate over guns at military facilities and terrorism is shaping up to be a major part of the presidential debate. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and said he shot at a military recruiting center before heading to a Navy operations support center, where he shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." END OF SUMMARY.
