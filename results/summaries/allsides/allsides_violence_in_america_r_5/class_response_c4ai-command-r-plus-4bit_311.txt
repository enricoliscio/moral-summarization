SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign, with Republicans blaming President Obama for what investigators have called an act of domestic terrorism. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a GOP nominee, criticized the President for not acknowledging the threat posed by radical Islam, while the President himself urged Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez and is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism, while early reports suggest he was a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. This incident adds to the growing concern over the threat of Islamic State and lone-wolf attacks in the U.S., with federal authorities having charged 62 people this year with planning attacks or providing support to the terrorist group. The shooting has also reignited debates about the policy prohibiting troops from being armed at military facilities. Lawmakers are divided on how to confront violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims. The Obama administration's labeling of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting as workplace violence has been criticized by Jindal, who believes that admitting the existence of evil is necessary to defeat it.
