SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans quickly blamed him for the domestic terrorism. Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the "evil" of jihadists, saying "radical Islam is at war with us." The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with Obama's policies under scrutiny. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." While the motive is unclear, the attack highlights the growing threat of Islamic State-inspired terrorism, with 62 people charged with planning attacks on behalf of the group. The incident also underscores the need for vigilance and honesty in confronting the threat of radical Islam.
