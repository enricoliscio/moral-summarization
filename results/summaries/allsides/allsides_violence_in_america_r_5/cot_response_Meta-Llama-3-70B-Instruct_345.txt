SUMMARY:
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans like Gov. Bobby Jindal were quick to blame the President, labeling the attack as "terrorism" and accusing him of failing to confront the "evil" of jihadists. Jindal argued that the White House needs to "wake up" and acknowledge that "radical Islam is at war with us." The attack has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and the threat of "domestic terrorism." The FBI is investigating the motives of the shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, who was born in Kuwait but was a naturalized U.S. citizen. The attack is a reminder that there are people in America who are intent on striking from within, driven by a "twisted ideology" that promotes "unconscionable acts of violence and hate."
