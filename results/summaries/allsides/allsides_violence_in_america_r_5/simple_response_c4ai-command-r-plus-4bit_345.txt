SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee by a gunman who was a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait has sparked a debate about terrorism and the threat of radical Islamic extremism in the upcoming 2016 presidential campaign. While President Obama called for Americans not to jump to conclusions, Republicans were quick to blame him for the incident, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not acknowledging the threat posed by jihadists. The shooting has also brought attention to the issue of gun control at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism, and early reports suggest the gunman may have been influenced by online propaganda or extremist groups. This incident adds to a growing list of terror plots and attacks on U.S. soil in recent years, with the threat from groups like the Islamic State and lone-wolf incidents on the rise. The Obama administration's response to the shooting and its previous designation of the Fort Hood shooting as "workplace violence" have been criticized by Republicans as minimizing the threat of radical Islam. Democrats, however, argue that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger and that government efforts should be focused there.
END OF SUMMARY.
