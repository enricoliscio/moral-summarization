Alright, I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author used. The article is about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee and the political and social reactions to it. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. President Obama called it heartbreaking and asked people not to jump to conclusions. Republicans, especially Bobby Jindal, are blaming Obama and calling it terrorism. There's mention of the shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, and the FBI treating it as domestic terrorism. 

I also notice the debate over gun policies at military facilities and the ongoing discussions about terrorism in the 2016 campaign. The article mentions past incidents, like Fort Hood, and how they were labeled differently. There's a split between Democrats and Republicans on who the real threats areâ€”radical Muslims vs. white supremacists.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to be about how different groups are attributing blame and the implications of labeling something as terrorism. The author presents both sides: Republicans accusing Obama and Democrats arguing against overemphasis on Islamic terrorism. 

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main events and reactions without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to mention Obama's response, the Republican accusations, the shooter's background, the debate on terrorism, and the political implications.

Let me structure it: start with the event, then Obama's reaction, followed by Republican responses, the FBI's stance, the debate on gun policies, and the broader political context. I'll end with the ongoing debate between parties on the threat sources.

I should avoid using markdown and keep the summary clear and to the point, preserving the moral aspects of blame and responsibility.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions, while Republicans quickly labeled the attack as domestic terrorism, criticizing Obama for not confronting radical Islamic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused the White House of failing to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam, as the shooting became a focal point in the 2016 presidential campaign. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and classified the attack as domestic terrorism. The incident reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the government's handling of terrorism threats. While Obama avoided using the term "terror," Republicans argued that his administration had downplayed past attacks, such as the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, as workplace violence. Democrats countered that white supremacists and anti-government extremists posed a greater threat than radicalized Muslims. The shooting highlighted the political divide over how to address terrorism and its roots. END OF SUMMARY.
