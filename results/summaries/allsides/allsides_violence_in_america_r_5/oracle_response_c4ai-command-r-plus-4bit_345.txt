SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and asked Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans quickly blamed him for what investigators called domestic terrorism, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not confronting the dangers posed by "radical Islamic terrorism." The shooting has reignited debates about guns at military facilities and the threat of terrorism in the 2016 presidential campaign. Officials acknowledged that troops at the Naval Reserve center were prohibited from being armed, leading to calls for policy changes. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but cautioned against speculating on his motives. U.S. Attorney Bill Killian, however, called the shooting an "act of domestic terrorism." The threat from Islamic State and lone wolf incidents is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people this year for planning attacks or supporting the group. Thursday's shooting is reminiscent of previous attacks during Obama's tenure, including the 2009 Fort Hood shooting that the administration labeled as workplace violence. Lawmakers are debating how the government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims.
