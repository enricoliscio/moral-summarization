SUMMARY: President Obama referred to the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking" and asked Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans quickly blamed him for what investigators called domestic terrorism, with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not acknowledging the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting has brought attention to the debate over guns at military facilities, as the troops at the Naval Reserve center were prohibited from being armed. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the shooting is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism. This incident has reignited discussions about the threat of Islamic State and radicalized Muslims, with some questioning the Obama administration's labeling of the Fort Hood shooting as workplace violence. Lawmakers are debating how the government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger.
