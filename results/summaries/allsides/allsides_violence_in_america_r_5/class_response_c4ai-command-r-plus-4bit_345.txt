SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking," pleading with Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans quickly blamed him for what investigators called domestic terrorism, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the president for not acknowledging the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Terrorism is expected to be a significant issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, with Mr. Obama's policies likely to be scrutinized. The shooting also sparked a debate about the prohibition of troops from carrying arms at military facilities. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez and said he shot at a military recruiting center before killing four Marines at a Navy operations support center. While authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism, the motive is still unclear. The threat of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the U.S. is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people this year for planning attacks or providing support to the terrorist group. Lawmakers are debating how to confront violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims.
END OF SUMMARY.
