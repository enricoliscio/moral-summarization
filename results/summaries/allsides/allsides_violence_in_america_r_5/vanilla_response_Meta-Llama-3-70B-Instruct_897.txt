SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, were quick to blame the president for the attack, terming it domestic terrorism. The shooting at a Naval Reserve center in Chattanooga is being investigated, with the FBI identifying the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen. Authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism, but it's too early to determine if the gunman had ties to al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The attack has reignited debates over gun control and terrorism, with some lawmakers arguing that the Obama administration's policies have failed to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The incident is likely to be a major part of the 2016 presidential campaign.
