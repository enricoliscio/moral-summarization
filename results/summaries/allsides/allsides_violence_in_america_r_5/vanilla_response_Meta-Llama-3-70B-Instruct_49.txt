SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be terrorism and that Obama needs to confront the dangers posed by radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting reignited the debate over guns at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were prohibited from being armed. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The incident has sparked a debate over how to confront violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims.
