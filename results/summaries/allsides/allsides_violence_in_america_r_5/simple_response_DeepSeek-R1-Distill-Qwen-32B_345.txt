Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should include the moral aspects highlighted in the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, the political reactions, and the context of terrorism in the U.S. The key elements are President Obama's response, Republican criticism, the role of domestic terrorism, the shooter's background, and the broader implications for the 2016 election and policy debates.

I need to capture the moral framing, which includes the debate over whether the attack was terrorism, the political divide between Obama and Republicans, and the ongoing issues with radicalization and gun policies at military facilities. The summary should reflect how the event is being used in the political arena and the differing viewpoints on how to address terrorism.

I'll start by mentioning the attack and Obama's cautious response, then note the Republican criticism and their framing of the issue as a failure of Obama's policies. I'll include the FBI's classification as domestic terrorism and the shooter's background. Then, I'll touch on the policy debates, like gun access at military facilities and the broader counterterrorism efforts. I should also mention the historical context of similar attacks under Obama's tenure and the political implications for the election.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure each key point is included. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward, focusing on the moral and political aspects without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged caution, while Republicans quickly labeled it domestic terrorism, linking it to radical Islamic threats and criticizing Obama's policies. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused the administration of failing to confront jihadist dangers, framing the attack as part of a broader war against radical Islam. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a U.S. citizen, and classified the attack as domestic terrorism. The incident reignited debates over military facility gun policies and counterterrorism efforts, with Democrats arguing white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat than radicalized Muslims. The shooting also highlighted the growing threat of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the U.S., with 62 individuals charged in 2014-2015 for supporting or planning attacks. The attack mirrored earlier incidents under Obama's tenure, with critics arguing the administration's reluctance to label such acts as terrorism undermines efforts to combat extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
