SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. The shooting, which is being investigated as an "act of domestic terrorism," has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself. The attack is a reminder that there are people in America who are intent on striking from within, driven by an evil and twisted ideology. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with 62 people charged with planning attacks on the homeland on behalf of the terror group. The shooting is a tragedy that underscores the grave reality of the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism every single day.
