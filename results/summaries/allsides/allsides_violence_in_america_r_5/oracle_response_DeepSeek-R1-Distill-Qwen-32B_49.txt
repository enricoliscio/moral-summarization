Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the murder of Marines in Tennessee, the political reactions, and the context of terrorism and gun control. President Obama is cautious, while Republicans are quick to blame him and frame it as terrorism.

I should start by mentioning the murder and the political divide. Then, include the governor's statement about terrorism and the need to confront it. Next, note the debate over gun policies at military facilities. Highlight the FBI's identification of the gunman and the ongoing investigation.

I need to mention the broader context of terrorism, including the Islamic State's influence and past incidents under Obama's tenure. Also, include the statistics on charged individuals and the internal congressional document. Finally, touch on the ongoing debate between Democrats and Republicans about the threats.

I'll make sure to use words like "murder," "terrorism," "shooting," "killed," "investigation," "charged," "plots," "violence," and "danger" to maintain the moral framing. Keep each point concise to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions, while Republicans quickly blamed him for what they termed domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the "evil" of radical Islamic terrorism, citing the shooting as evidence of the ongoing threat. The incident reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the administration's handling of terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and labeled the attack an act of domestic terrorism. Authorities are investigating whether the shooter had ties to extremist groups like al Qaeda or ISIS. The attack also highlighted the growing threat of radicalized individuals in the U.S., with federal charges against 62 people for planning ISIS-related attacks. The shooting echoed earlier incidents under Obama's tenure, including the Fort Hood massacre, which was labeled workplace violence. Lawmakers remain divided over whether radicalized Muslims or other groups pose the greater danger. END OF SUMMARY.
