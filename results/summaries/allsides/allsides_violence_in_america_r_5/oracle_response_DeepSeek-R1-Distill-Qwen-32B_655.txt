Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. I need to make sure the summary stays under 200 words and uses as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the murder of Marines in Tennessee, the political reactions, especially from Republicans blaming Obama, the mention of domestic terrorism, and the debate over gun policies at military facilities. There's also information about the suspect, the investigation, and broader terrorism trends.

Next, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the list that are present in the article. Words like murder, terrorism, shooting, killing, danger, threat, war, attack, incidents, rise, etc., are all used. I should ensure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the murder, Obama's response, Republican reactions, the suspect's background, the investigation, and the ongoing debates about terrorism and gun policies.

I need to keep the summary concise. I'll mention the political divide, the focus on radical Islam, and the statistics on terrorism charges. Also, the comparison to past incidents under Obama's tenure and the debate on government efforts against different extremist groups.

I'll structure the summary to include all these elements, making sure to use the morally framed words without making it too verbose. I'll aim for clarity and inclusion of all critical points while adhering to the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the required words are included naturally.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking," urging Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions. Republicans, however, quickly blamed him for what they termed domestic terrorism, tying the incident to the 2016 presidential campaign. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, calling it a "war" against the U.S. The shooting, carried out by 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, targeted a military recruiting center and a Navy facility. While the FBI labeled it an "act of domestic terrorism," Obama avoided using the word "terror," emphasizing the need for facts. The incident reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the rise of lone-wolf attacks. Authorities have charged 62 individuals linked to Islamic State since 2014, with many being young men, including foreign-born citizens. The attack also drew comparisons to past shootings under Obama's tenure, such as the Fort Hood incident, which was labeled workplace violence. Lawmakers debated whether radicalized Muslims or other groups posed a greater danger, highlighting the growing threat of terrorism and the need for vigilance. END OF SUMMARY.
