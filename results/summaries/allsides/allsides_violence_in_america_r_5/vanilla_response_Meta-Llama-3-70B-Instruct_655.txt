SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for what investigators termed domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the killing appeared to be terrorism and that Obama needs to confront the dangers posed by radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, which is expected to be a major part of the 2016 presidential campaign. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism" and are investigating whether the gunman had ties to al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The incident has raised concerns about the growing threat of the Islamic State and the need for vigilance in countering extremist ideology.
