SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. The shooting, which is being treated as an "act of domestic terrorism," has sparked a heated debate over terrorism and gun control. The gunman, identified as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself. The FBI is conducting a thorough investigation into the tragedy, but authorities are already treating it as a terrorist attack. Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, are accusing Obama of not confronting the dangers posed by radical Islamic terrorism, which they claim is at war with the US. The shooting has reignited the debate over guns at military facilities, with some calling for a change in policy to allow troops to be armed. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland on behalf of the terror group.
