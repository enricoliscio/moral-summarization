Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the murder of Marines in Tennessee and the subsequent political and moral reactions. The user provided a list of morally framed words that must be included in the summary. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the key points. President Obama is reacting to the tragedy, Republicans are blaming him, and there's a debate about terrorism and gun policies. The shooter's background and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S. are also important.

I should identify the main events: the shooting, Obama's response, Republican accusations, the investigation, and the policy implications. I need to use as many of the provided moral words as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll start by mentioning the murder and Obama's heartfelt response. Then, note the Republicans' accusations and the framing of the attack as terrorism. Include the debate over gun policies at military facilities. Mention the FBI's identification of the shooter and the ongoing investigation. Highlight the broader context of terrorism cases and the political debate between Democrats and Republicans on the threat from radical Islam versus other groups.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. I'll structure it to cover the immediate event, political reactions, investigation details, and the broader implications. Using the moral words like 'heartbreaking,' 'terrorism,''murder,' 'violence,' etc., will help maintain the framing.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary is concise and captures all critical aspects without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to wait for facts, while Republicans quickly framed the shooting as domestic terrorism, linking it to radical Islamic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to address the threat posed by jihadists, stating it was time to acknowledge that radical Islam is "at war" with the U.S. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and labeled the attack an "act of domestic terrorism." Investigations are ongoing to determine if the shooter had ties to al Qaeda or ISIS. The incident reflects a growing threat, with 62 people charged in 2014 and 2015 for planning attacks or supporting ISIS, including young men and foreign-born individuals. The shooting also sparked a broader debate over how to counter violent extremism, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger than radicalized Muslims. The tragedy underscores the ongoing reality of terrorism and the need for vigilance in addressing its roots. END OF SUMMARY.
