SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans quickly blamed him for the domestic terrorism. Gov. Bobby Jindal claimed the killing was terrorism and accused Obama of failing to confront the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with some arguing that Obama's policies are to blame. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. The incident highlights the growing threat of the Islamic State, with 62 people charged with planning attacks on the homeland. Republicans argue that Obama's administration has failed to acknowledge the reality of radical Islamic terrorism, while Democrats argue that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger.
