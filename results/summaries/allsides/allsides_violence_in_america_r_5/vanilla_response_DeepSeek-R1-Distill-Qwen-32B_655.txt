Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama and the murder of four Marines in Tennessee. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it needs to be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the tragic event where four Marines were killed, the political reactions, especially from Republicans blaming Obama, and the debate over terrorism and gun policies.

I should start by identifying the key elements: who was involved, what happened, the reactions from different parties, and the implications for the political landscape. The article mentions that the shooter was identified as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, and it's being treated as domestic terrorism. Republicans like Bobby Jindal are criticizing Obama's handling of Islamic terrorism, while Obama is cautious about labeling it as terrorism without more information.

Also, there's mention of the debate over gun policies at military facilities and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S., including past incidents and statistics on charges related to Islamic State activities.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and covers all these points without getting too detailed. I should avoid political bias and present the facts objectively.

Let me structure this: start with the event, mention Obama's response, the Republican reaction, the shooter's background, the FBI's classification, and the ongoing debates about terrorism and gun policies. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without redundancy.

I should also check the word count to stay under 200 words. Maybe use bullet points in my mind to condense each section.

Wait, the user provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide. The example is well-structured, so I can follow a similar approach but ensure it's my own summary.

I think I have a good grasp now. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama expressed deep sorrow over the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, urging Americans to avoid hasty conclusions. Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama for failing to address radical Islamic terrorism, calling the attack an act of domestic terrorism. The shooter, identified as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, targeted military facilities in Chattanooga. While Obama avoided labeling the attack as terrorism, the FBI classified it as domestic terrorism. The incident sparked debates over gun policies at military facilities and the threat of radicalization, with lawmakers divided on whether radicalized Muslims or white supremacists pose a greater danger. The shooting also highlighted the growing threat of Islamic State-related activities in the U.S., with 62 people charged since 2014 for supporting the group. Obamaâ€™s cautious approach contrasted with Republican calls for a tougher stance on terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
