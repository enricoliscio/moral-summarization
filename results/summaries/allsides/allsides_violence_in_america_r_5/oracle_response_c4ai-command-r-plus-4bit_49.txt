SUMMARY: President Obama referred to the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking," while Republicans blamed him for what investigators called domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticized the Obama administration for not acknowledging the threat posed by radical Islam, calling for a wake-up call to confront the dangers of jihadists. Terrorism is expected to be a significant part of the 2016 presidential debate, with Obama's policies at the center. The shooting also sparked a debate about the prohibition of troops from carrying arms at military facilities. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but cautioned against speculating on his motives. Authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and investigating possible ties to extremist groups. The threat of Islamic State-inspired attacks in the U.S. is rising, with federal authorities charging a growing number of people with planning attacks or providing support to the group. The incident has drawn comparisons to previous shootings during Obama's tenure, and questions remain about the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. Critics argue that the administration's reluctance to acknowledge the threat of radical Islam is detrimental to national security.
END OF SUMMARY.
