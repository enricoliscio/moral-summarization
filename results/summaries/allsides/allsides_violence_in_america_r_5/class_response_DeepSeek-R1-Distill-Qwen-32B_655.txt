Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, labeled as domestic terrorism. President Obama called it heartbreaking and urged caution, while Republicans, especially GOP candidates like Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama and linked it to radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting has become part of the 2016 campaign, highlighting debates on terrorism and gun policies at military facilities.

I should note the morally charged words used: murder, heartbreaking, terrorism, shooting, etc. I need to include these in the summary to maintain the author's framing. The article also mentions the gunman's background, the FBI's investigation, and the broader context of terrorism threats, including past incidents like Fort Hood.

I should structure the summary to cover the immediate event, political reactions, the investigation, and the broader implications. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while including as many moral terms as possible.

I'll start by stating the event and the emotional response from Obama. Then, mention the Republican reaction and the political implications. Next, detail the investigation and the gunman's background. Finally, touch on the ongoing debates and the rise in terrorism cases.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point without losing the moral emphasis. Let me piece it together, making sure to include all key elements and the specified moral words.

SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions, while Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed him for the domestic terrorism attack. The shooting, carried out by 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, targeted a military recruiting center and a Navy operations center, killing four Marines. The FBI labeled the attack as domestic terrorism, though the gunman's motives remain under investigation. The incident reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Republicans criticized Obama for not acknowledging the "evil" of jihadists, while Democrats argued that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger. The shooting also highlighted the growing threat of terrorism, with federal authorities charging 62 people for planning attacks or supporting ISIS since 2014. The attack echoed earlier incidents, such as the Fort Hood shooting, which Obama labeled workplace violence, sparking criticism from Republicans. END OF SUMMARY.
