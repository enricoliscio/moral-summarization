SUMMARY:
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him, with Gov. Bobby Jindal saying the killing appeared to be "terrorism" and that Obama needs to confront the "evil" of jihadists. Jindal argued that the White House needs to "wake up and tell the truth" that "radical Islam is at war with us." The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with Obama's policies under scrutiny. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The incident highlights the growing threat from the Islamic State, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland. END OF SUMMARY.
