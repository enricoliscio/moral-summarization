SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. The shooting, which is being treated as an "act of domestic terrorism," has reignited the debate over guns at military facilities and terrorism policies. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot at a military recruiting center before heading to a Navy operations support center, where he killed the four Marines. The attack is a reminder of the growing threat from the Islamic State, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland on behalf of the terror group. The incident has sparked a debate over how the federal government confronts violent extremists, with some arguing that the government needs to acknowledge the danger posed by radical Islamic terrorism.
