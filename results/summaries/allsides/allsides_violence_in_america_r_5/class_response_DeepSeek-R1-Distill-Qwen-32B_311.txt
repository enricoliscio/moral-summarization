Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, which is called "heartbreaking" by Obama. Republicans, like Bobby Jindal, are blaming Obama and calling it terrorism. The shooting is part of the 2016 campaign. The FBI identified the gunman as Abdulazeez, a naturalized citizen. The article also mentions the debate over guns at military facilities and the broader context of terrorism threats, including Islamic State and past attacks.

I need to include words like murder, heartbreaking, terrorism, shooting, killed, etc. I should structure the summary to cover the key events and the political responses, making sure to highlight the moral language used.

I'll start by stating the event, then mention Obama's response and the Republican reaction. Next, I'll include the FBI's identification and the context of terrorism. Then, touch on the policy debates and the broader threat landscape. Finally, I'll note the comparison to past incidents and the ongoing debate in Congress.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary moral terms. I'll avoid technical jargon and stick to the key points, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions, while Republicans quickly blamed him, framing the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, asserting that the U.S. must acknowledge the "evil" of jihadism. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who targeted military facilities in Chattanooga before being killed. Authorities labeled the attack as domestic terrorism, though investigations into his motives were ongoing. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the growing threat of terrorism, with lawmakers divided over whether radicalized Muslims or other groups posed a greater danger. The incident also highlighted the increasing number of U.S.-based terror plots linked to the Islamic State. Obama's handling of past attacks, such as the Fort Hood shooting, came under scrutiny, with critics arguing the administration had downplayed the threat of terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
