SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism, which they claimed was a result of his failure to confront the "evil" of jihadists. The shooting, which is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism, has reignited the debate over guns at military facilities and the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, who shot and killed the four Marines before being killed himself. The attack is a reminder of the growing threat from the Islamic State, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on the homeland on behalf of the terror group. The incident has sparked a debate over how the federal government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger.
