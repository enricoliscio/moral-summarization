SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has brought terrorism to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign, with Republicans blaming President Obama for what investigators have called an "act of domestic terrorism." The shooting has also reignited the debate over gun policies at military facilities, as the troops at the Naval Reserve center were prohibited from being armed. The gunman, identified as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait, shot at a military recruiting center before heading to a Navy operations support center, killing four Marines before being killed himself. While the FBI has not yet determined a motive, U.S. Attorney Bill Killian has labeled the shooting an act of domestic terrorism. This incident underscores the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the increasing number of terror plots and attacks on U.S. soil. President Obama, in his brief remarks, expressed his condolences and asked Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions. The shooting has sparked discussions about the dangers posed by jihadists, as well as the vulnerability of military personnel at recruiting centers and other facilities where troops are not armed. This incident also highlights the increasing number of young men influenced by online propaganda and extremist ideologies, underscoring the need for vigilance in countering violent extremism.
