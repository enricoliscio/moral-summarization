SUMMARY: On Thursday, four Marines were murdered in Tennessee, with the FBI identifying the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. While President Obama called for Americans not to jump to conclusions, Republicans quickly blamed him for what investigators termed domestic terrorism, with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticizing the President for not acknowledging the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting has brought attention to the debate over guns at military facilities and the policies of the Obama administration regarding terrorism. The shooting also highlights the growing threat of Islamic State and lone wolf incidents, with federal authorities charging 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the group. The incident has sparked discussions on Capitol Hill regarding how the government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat.
