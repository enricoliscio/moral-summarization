SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has sparked political debate, with Republicans blaming President Obama for what investigators are calling an act of domestic terrorism. The shooting has brought attention to the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the Obama administration's policies regarding it. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a GOP nominee, criticized the administration for not acknowledging the threat posed by jihadists. Terrorism is expected to be a major topic in the 2016 presidential campaign, with the rise of the Islamic State and other lone-wolf incidents. The shooting has also reignited debates about gun policies at military facilities. President Obama, however, refrained from politicizing the tragedy and called for Americans to wait for more facts before jumping to conclusions. The FBI identified the shooter as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait, and is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with an increasing number of young men being charged with planning attacks on behalf of the group. This incident highlights the challenges faced by the government in countering violent extremism, both from radicalized Muslims and other extremist groups.
