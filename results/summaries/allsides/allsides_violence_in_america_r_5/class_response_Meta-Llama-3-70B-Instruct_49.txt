SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions, but Republicans were quick to blame him for the domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused Obama of failing to confront the "evil" of jihadists, saying "radical Islam is at war with us." The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with questions surrounding Obama's policies. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." Rep. Michael McCaul warned that "there are people right here in America who are intent on striking from within," and the threat from the Islamic State is growing, with 62 people charged with planning attacks on the homeland. The attack is a reminder of the "grave reality of the threat posed to us by radical Islamic terrorism every single day."
