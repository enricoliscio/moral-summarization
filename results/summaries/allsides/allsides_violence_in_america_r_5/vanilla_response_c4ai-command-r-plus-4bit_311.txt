SUMMARY: President Obama responded to the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, calling it "heartbreaking." Republicans, however, quickly blamed the President for what investigators called an act of domestic terrorism. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a GOP nominee, criticized Obama for not acknowledging the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting has brought attention to the debate over guns at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but cautioned against speculating on his motives. Authorities are treating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. The incident has sparked discussions about the growing threat of Islamic State and the increasing number of terror plots within the U.S. Similar incidents during Obama's tenure, such as the Fort Hood shooting, have been labeled as workplace violence. Lawmakers are debating how the government should confront violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat.
END OF SUMMARY.
