Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, and how it's becoming a political issue. President Obama is reacting, and Republicans are blaming him, calling it domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is particularly vocal, saying Obama needs to acknowledge the threat from radical Islam. 

I also notice that the article mentions the shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, and how the FBI is treating it as domestic terrorism. There's a debate over gun policies at military facilities because the troops weren't armed. The incident is reigniting discussions about terrorism in the 2016 election, especially with the Islamic State's presence and past attacks like Benghazi.

Obama is keeping his remarks low-key, not using the word "terror" and asking for patience as investigations continue. The article also provides statistics on terrorism charges, showing an increase, especially among young men and foreign-born individuals. There's a comparison to past attacks during Obama's tenure, like the Fort Hood shooting, and a debate in Congress about whether the threat is more from white supremacists or Muslims.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the key elements: the attack, political reactions, the shooter's background, the policy debate on guns, the rise in terrorism cases, and the ongoing political debate about the threat's source. I'll structure it to highlight the immediate reaction, the political implications, and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S.

Let me make sure I include all the important points without getting too detailed. Also, I should present it neutrally, just summarizing the facts without bias. I'll start by mentioning the attack and the political responses, then move on to the shooter's background and the policy debate. Finally, I'll touch on the statistics and the ongoing debates in Congress. That should cover the main aspects concisely.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to wait for facts, while Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, accused him of failing to address radical Islamic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a U.S. citizen, and labeled the attack as domestic terrorism. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities, as troops at the affected Naval Reserve center were unarmed. Obama avoided using the term "terror" and focused on condolences, while Democrats and Republicans clashed over the threat posed by radicalized Muslims versus other extremists. The incident highlighted growing concerns about terrorism in the U.S., with 62 individuals charged in 2014-2015 for supporting or planning attacks for ISIS or al-Qaeda. The attack also drew comparisons to past shootings during Obama's tenure, such as the Fort Hood incident. END OF SUMMARY.
