SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee has brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign, with Republicans blaming President Obama for what investigators have called an act of domestic terrorism. The shooting has also sparked a debate over the policy prohibiting troops from being armed at military facilities. Governor Bobby Jindal, a GOP nominee, criticized Obama for not acknowledging the threat posed by radical Islam, while the President urged Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting before jumping to conclusions. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, but has not yet determined the motive behind the attack. The incident adds to the growing list of terrorist attacks and plots uncovered in the U.S., with federal authorities charging individuals planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State or providing material support. This shooting has also drawn comparisons to previous incidents during Obama's tenure, including the Fort Hood shooting, which was labeled as workplace violence. Lawmakers are debating how the government should address violent extremists, with some questioning whether enough is being done to counter the threat of radical Islam.
