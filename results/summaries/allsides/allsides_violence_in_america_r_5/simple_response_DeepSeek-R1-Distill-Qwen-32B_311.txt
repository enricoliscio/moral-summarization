Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, with President Obama calling it heartbreaking and asking for patience. Republicans, especially Bobby Jindal, are blaming Obama and framing it as domestic terrorism linked to radical Islam. There's a mention of the Islamic State's influence and past attacks like Benghazi. The debate over gun policies at military facilities is also brought up, with some advocating for arming troops.

Obama is cautious, not using the word 'terror' and emphasizing waiting for facts. The FBI identifies the shooter as Abdulazeez, a U.S. citizen, and treats it as domestic terrorism. There's uncertainty about his ties to extremist groups. The article also notes an increase in U.S.-based terror plots, with many involving young men and some foreign-born individuals. It compares this incident to past shootings under Obama, where the administration labeled them differently, causing criticism from Republicans.

Democrats argue that white supremacists and anti-government groups are a bigger threat, questioning the focus on Muslims.

So, the summary should include the key points: the attack, Obama's response, Republican blame, the framing as terrorism, the debate over policy, Abdulazeez's background, the rise in terror plots, comparisons to past events, and the political debate over threats.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”Republicans linking it to Obama's policies and radical Islam, while Democrats counter with other threats.

Let me structure it: start with the attack, mention Obama's and Republicans' responses, the investigation, policy debates, comparisons to past events, and the political divide on threats.

I'll make sure to include the moral elements, like Jindal's criticism and the ongoing debate over threat sources.

SUMMARY: President Obama condemned the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking," urging Americans to avoid hasty conclusions. Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, accused Obama of failing to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, framing the attack as domestic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, as a U.S. citizen born in Kuwait, and labeled the attack as domestic terrorism, though his motives remain under investigation. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and Obama's handling of terrorism. The incident also highlighted the rise of U.S.-based terror plots linked to the Islamic State, with 62 individuals charged in 2014-2015, many young men and foreign-born. Republicans criticized Obama for not labeling past attacks as terrorism, while Democrats argued that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat. The attack underscores the ongoing political divide over national security priorities. END OF SUMMARY.
