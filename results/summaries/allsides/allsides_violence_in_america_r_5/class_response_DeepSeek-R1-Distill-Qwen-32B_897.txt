Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is reacting to the murder of Marines, Republicans are blaming him for terrorism, and the shooting is becoming part of the 2016 campaign. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is calling it terrorism and criticizing Obama. The article also mentions the rise of domestic terrorism, lone-wolf incidents, and the debate over gun policies at military facilities. There's a lot about the threat from radical Islam, the Islamic State, and past attacks during Obama's tenure.

I need to include words like "murder," "heartbreaking," "terrorism," "shooting," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the political divide, the moral implications of labeling the attack as terrorism, and the ongoing debates about policy and threats.

I'll start by stating the event and Obama's reaction, then move to the Republican response. Mention the debate over gun policies, the FBI's identification of the gunman, and the ongoing investigations. Then touch on the broader context of terrorism threats and past incidents. Finally, note the political and policy debates, including the criticism of Obama's handling and the statistics on terrorism plots.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. Also, I should use as many of the provided moral words as possible without forcing them in. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each part flows logically and includes the necessary moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Obama described the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking," urging Americans to avoid jumping to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama for what they called domestic terrorism, linking the shooting to radical Islamic terrorism. The attack reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the threat of terrorism in the U.S. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and labeled the shooting an act of domestic terrorism. While investigations into his motives continued, lawmakers debated the growing threat of radical Islam and the need to counter extremist influence. The incident highlighted the ongoing challenge of terrorism, with federal authorities charging 62 individuals for planning attacks or supporting ISIS since 2014. The shooting also drew parallels to past attacks during Obama's tenure, with critics arguing the administration downplayed the threat of terrorism. Democrats, meanwhile, questioned whether the focus on Muslim extremists overshadowed dangers posed by white supremacists and anti-government groups. The tragedy underscored the moral imperative to address terrorism and prevent future attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
