Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Obama's response to the murder of four Marines in Tennessee. Republicans are blaming him, calling it domestic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is particularly critical, saying Obama needs to address the threat from radical Islam. The article mentions the Islamic State's presence and past attacks like Benghazi. There's also a debate over gun policies at military facilities since the shooters weren't armed. Obama stayed away from politics in his comments, asking for patience while the investigation continues. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a U.S. citizen, and labeled the attack as domestic terrorism. Lawmakers are discussing the threat from radicalized individuals, with some pointing out that white supremacists and anti-government groups might be a bigger threat. The article also notes an increase in terror plots linked to the Islamic State.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll start with the main event: the murder of Marines and the political response. Then mention the Republican criticism, Jindal's comments, and the link to previous attacks. Include the FBI's identification of the gunman and the domestic terrorism label. Also, touch on the debate over gun policies and the ongoing discussions in Congress about threats from different groups. Make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.
