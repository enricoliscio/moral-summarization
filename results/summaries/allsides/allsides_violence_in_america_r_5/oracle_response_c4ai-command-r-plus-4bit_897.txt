SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking," and asked Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans were quick to blame him for what investigators called an act of domestic terrorism. The shooting has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, seeking the GOP nomination, criticized Obama for not confronting the dangers posed by jihadists and labeled the shooting as terrorism. Terrorism is shaping up to be a major part of the 2016 presidential debate, with Obama's policies at the root. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez and said he shot at a military recruiting center before killing four Marines at a Navy operations support center. While the motive is still unknown, U.S. Attorney Bill Killian called it an act of domestic terrorism. The threat from groups like the Islamic State is growing, and federal authorities have charged dozens of people with planning attacks or providing support. This shooting is a reminder of the danger posed by lone wolves and the need to counter extremist ideologies. Lawmakers are debating how to confront violent extremists, with some questioning whether the government's efforts are focused on the right areas.
