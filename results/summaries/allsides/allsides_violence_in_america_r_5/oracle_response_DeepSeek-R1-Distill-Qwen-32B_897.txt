Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, President Obama's response, and how Republicans are using this event in the 2016 campaign. The author uses strong moral terms like "murder," "terrorism," "killing," etc., so I need to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the attack, the president's statement, Republican reactions, the investigation, and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S. I should mention the shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, and the fact that the FBI called it domestic terrorism. Also, the debate over gun policies at military facilities is important.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words like "murder," "terrorism," "killing," "threat," "attacks," etc., to reflect the author's perspective.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: start with the event, move to political reactions, then the investigation and broader implications. I'll avoid using markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

Let me check if I'm including all necessary elements: the attack details, Obama's response, Republican accusations, the shooter's background, the FBI's stance, the Fort Hood comparison, and the ongoing debates about threats and policies. I should make sure each of these points is touched upon briefly.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and that it captures the moral tone by using the specified words. I'll review it to make sure it's clear and covers all key aspects without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans to wait for facts, while Republicans accused him of failing to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal labeled the shooting as terrorism, claiming Obama must confront the "evil" of jihadists. The attack, carried out by Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was treated as an act of domestic terrorism by the FBI. The shooting reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the growing threat of terrorism in the U.S. Federal authorities have charged 62 individuals linked to Islamic State, with many being young men, including some foreign-born citizens. The incident echoed earlier attacks, such as the Fort Hood shooting, which Obama labeled workplace violence. Republicans criticized this designation, arguing the administration must acknowledge the threat of radical Islam. Democrats countered that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater danger. The debate over how to counter terrorism and extremism remains unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
