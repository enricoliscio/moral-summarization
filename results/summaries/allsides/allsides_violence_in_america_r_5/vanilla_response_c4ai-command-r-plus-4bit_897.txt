SUMMARY: The murder of four Marines in Tennessee by a gunman, identified as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, has sparked political debate and brought terrorism to the forefront of the 2016 presidential campaign. Louisiana Governor and GOP nominee Bobby Jindal criticized President Obama for not addressing the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, while Obama urged Americans to wait for more facts about the shooting. The FBI is investigating the incident as domestic terrorism, and early reports suggest Abdulazeez was a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. The shooting has also reignited the debate over gun policies at military facilities, as troops at the Naval Reserve center were unarmed. Terrorism is expected to be a major part of the presidential debate, with Obama's policies under scrutiny. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, and federal authorities have charged 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the group. This incident has also drawn comparisons to previous shootings during Obama's tenure, including the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, which was labeled as workplace violence by the Obama administration. Lawmakers are debating how the government confronts violent extremists, with Democrats arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat than radicalized Muslims.
