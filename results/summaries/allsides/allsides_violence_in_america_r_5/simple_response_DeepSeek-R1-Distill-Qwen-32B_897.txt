Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee, and how it's become a political issue. President Obama is cautious, not jumping to conclusions, while Republicans, especially Bobby Jindal, are quick to blame Obama and frame it as terrorism linked to radical Islam. There's a lot of focus on the political implications, with the 2016 campaign in mind. The article also mentions past incidents and statistics about terrorism charges, showing a trend.

I need to capture the moral framing, which includes the political divide and the implications of labeling the attack as terrorism. The summary should highlight how the event is being used politically and the differing viewpoints on the threat of Islamic terrorism versus other forms of extremism.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the main elements: the attack, Obama's response, Republican reactions, the FBI's classification, and the broader context of terrorism debates.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the attack, mention Obama's cautious approach, then the Republican blame and framing, the FBI's classification, the debate over the threat, and the political implications.

I need to ensure that the moral aspects, like the necessity to address terrorism honestly versus the risk of overgeneralizing, are clear. Also, include the statistics about terrorism charges to show the growing concern.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward, making sure the summary flows logically from the attack to the political reactions and broader context.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama described the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking," urging Americans to avoid quick conclusions. Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, blamed Obama for what they called domestic terrorism, linking it to radical Islamic extremism. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and classified the attack as domestic terrorism. While authorities investigated potential ties to extremist groups, Democrats argued that white supremacists and anti-government extremists posed a greater threat than radicalized Muslims. The shooting reignited debates over military facility security and Obama's policies, with Jindal criticizing the administration for not confronting the threat of radical Islam. The incident also highlighted the growing concern over terrorism, with federal authorities charging 62 individuals for Islamic State-related plots in 2014-2015, including young men and naturalized citizens. The attack underscored the political and ideological divisions over how to address terrorism in the U.S.  
END OF SUMMARY.
