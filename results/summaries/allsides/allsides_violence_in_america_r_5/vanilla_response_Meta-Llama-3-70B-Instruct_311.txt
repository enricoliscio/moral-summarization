SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, were quick to blame Obama for the attack, which they termed domestic terrorism. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Kuwait. Authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The attack has reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, with some arguing that Obama's policies have not done enough to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The shooting is the latest in a series of lone-wolf incidents, with federal authorities having charged 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State or trying to provide material support to the terror group.
