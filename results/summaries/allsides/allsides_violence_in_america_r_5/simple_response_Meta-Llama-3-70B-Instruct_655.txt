SUMMARY:

President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and urged Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, quickly blamed him for the domestic terrorism, saying the White House needs to confront the dangers posed by "evil" jihadists. The shooting reignited debates over guns at military facilities and terrorism, which is shaping up to be a major part of the 2016 presidential campaign. The FBI identified the gunman as 24-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and authorities are treating the shooting as an "act of domestic terrorism." The threat from the Islamic State is growing, with 62 people charged with planning attacks on the homeland. The Obama administration's policies will be at the root of the presidential debate. The moral imperative is clear: we must acknowledge and confront the evil of radical Islamic terrorism to prevent further unconscionable acts of violence and hate.
