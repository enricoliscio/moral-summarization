Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee and the subsequent political reactions. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, President Obama is reacting to the shooting, calling it heartbreaking and asking people not to jump to conclusions. Republicans, on the other hand, are blaming him and framing it as domestic terrorism. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is a key figure here, stating that Obama needs to address the threat from radical Islam.

The article mentions that this incident is becoming part of the 2016 presidential campaign, especially with the Islamic State's presence in Iraq and Syria, the Benghazi attack, and lone-wolf incidents. It also touches on the debate over gun policies at military facilities, as the victims were at a Naval Reserve center where they weren't allowed to carry weapons.

Obama himself kept his remarks focused on condolences and asked for patience while more information is gathered. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the attack is being treated as domestic terrorism. However, there's no immediate confirmation of ties to groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda.

The article also provides statistics on terrorism charges in the U.S., noting an increase, especially among young men and foreign-born individuals. There's a comparison to past incidents under Obama's tenure, like the Fort Hood shooting, which was labeled workplace violence, drawing criticism from Republicans.

Finally, there's a debate in Congress about whether the focus should be on Muslim extremists or other groups like white supremacists.

So, the summary needs to capture all these elements concisely. I should include Obama's response, the political blame game, the classification of the attack as terrorism, the policy debates, and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be selective about the details.
