Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the murder of four Marines in Tennessee and the political reactions to it. President Obama called it heartbreaking and asked people not to jump to conclusions. Republicans, especially Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, are blaming Obama and calling it domestic terrorism related to radical Islam. The shooting has become part of the 2016 campaign. 

The article mentions that the shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, targeted military facilities and was killed. The FBI is treating it as domestic terrorism, but they're not sure about his motives yet. There's also mention of other similar attacks during Obama's tenure, like the Fort Hood shooting, which was labeled as workplace violence. 

Democrats argue that white supremacists and anti-government extremists are a bigger threat, while Republicans focus on radical Islam. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should include the key points: the attack, Obama's response, Republican reactions, the shooter's background, the political debate, and the comparison to past incidents. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
