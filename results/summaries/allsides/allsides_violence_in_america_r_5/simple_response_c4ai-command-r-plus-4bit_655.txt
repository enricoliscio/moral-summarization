SUMMARY: President Obama called the murder of four Marines in Tennessee "heartbreaking" and asked Americans not to jump to conclusions. However, Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, were quick to blame the president and his policies for what investigators called an act of domestic terrorism. The shooting has reignited debates about guns at military facilities and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, with some criticizing the Obama administration for not recognizing the Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism. The threat from the Islamic State is growing, and federal authorities have charged 62 people with planning attacks on behalf of the group. The shooting has also brought attention to the rise of lone-wolf incidents and the dangers posed by radicalized individuals within the United States. Lawmakers are debating how the government should confront violent extremists, with some arguing that white supremacists and anti-government extremists pose a greater threat than radicalized Muslims.
