Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about the Chattanooga shooting and its implications on the 2016 presidential campaign. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It talks about the shooting, President Obama's response, Republican reactions, the investigation, and the broader context of terrorism in the U.S. The moral framing here seems to be about how different parties are interpreting the eventâ€”Republicans are quick to blame Obama and link it to radical Islam, while Obama is cautious and avoids the term 'terror.'

I should focus on capturing these elements in the summary. It's important to include Obama's measured response, the Republican criticism, the FBI's classification as domestic terrorism, and the ongoing debates about gun policies and terrorism. Also, the article mentions past incidents and statistics, which highlight the growing threat and political implications.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral perspectives presented. I'll structure it by starting with the event, then moving to political reactions, the investigation, and the broader context. I'll make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed, keeping it clear and to the point.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure to highlight the moral framing by showing how each side is positioning the issue. This way, the summary not only informs but also reflects the underlying moral arguments presented in the article.

SUMMARY: President Obama described the murder of four Marines in Tennessee as "heartbreaking," urging Americans to await more facts before drawing conclusions. Republicans, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, accused Obama of failing to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, framing the attack as part of a broader ideological conflict. The FBI labeled the shooting as "domestic terrorism," though it was too early to determine the shooter's motives. The incident reignited debates over gun policies at military facilities and the federal government's approach to combating terrorism. Democrats argued that white supremacists and anti-government extremists posed a greater threat than radicalized Muslims, while Republicans emphasized the need to acknowledge and confront radical Islam. The shooting also highlighted the growing threat of lone-wolf attacks and the federal government's efforts to counter terrorism, including charges against individuals linked to the Islamic State. The political divide over how to characterize and address such attacks was evident, with some calling for honesty about the threat of radical Islam, while others cautioned against premature conclusions. END OF SUMMARY.
