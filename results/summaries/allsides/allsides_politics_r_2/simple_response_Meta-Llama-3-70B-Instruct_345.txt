SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at a bar in Washington, D.C. over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley's "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" was so intense that Cuccinelli's neck veins were "bulging." The incident was described as "sad" and "shocking" by Cuccinelli, who attempted to deescalate the situation but was followed by O'Malley. The Democrat governor showed no regrets, justifying his behavior by citing the administration's treatment of immigrant children. The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate promoting the incident on social media. This incident highlights the disturbing trend of harassment of Trump administration officials and the moral decay of the left, who seem to condone and even encourage such behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
