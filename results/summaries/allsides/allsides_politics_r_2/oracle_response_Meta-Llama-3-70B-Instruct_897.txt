SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" on Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. The confrontation was marked by cussing, cursing, and a physical assault, with O'Malley's neck veins "bulging" as he screamed at Cuccinelli. The situation escalated, with O'Malley following Cuccinelli and bumping into him, inviting him to "take a swing." The incident was eventually de-escalated by a Democrat friend who intervened. O'Malley showed no remorse, justifying his behavior as a response to Cuccinelli's role in "putting refugee immigrant kids in cages." The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate expressing happiness over the incident, which is morally disgusting.

END OF SUMMARY.
