Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the main event is Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley publicly harassing Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, at a bar in Washington, D.C. They were both at a Gonzaga College High School event. O'Malley confronted Cuccinelli over Trump's immigration policies, leading to a heated exchange. Cuccinelli described the encounter as a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade," with O'Malley cursing and even involving his friends. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate but ended up leaving the bar. O'Malley later defended his actions, tying them to opposition against the administration's policies. Some on the left supported his actions, which the article frames as problematic, especially since it's a prominent Democrat doing the harassment. The article also mentions that this isn't the first time a Trump admin official was harassed, but it's notable because of O'Malley's prominence and the left's celebration of it.

Now, the user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. The original article seems to present O'Malley's actions as excessive and inappropriate, questioning the ethics of public harassment, even for a political cause. It also highlights the reaction from the left, suggesting a double standard or approval of such behavior, which is a moral concern.

I should make sure the summary includes all these elements without adding my own opinion, just reflecting the author's moral stance. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by first stating the event, then the confrontation details, Cuccinelli's reaction, O'Malley's defense, and the broader implications regarding the left's support. I'll keep the language neutral but include the moral elements as presented.

Let me draft that:

Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a Washington, D.C., bar, criticizing Trump's immigration policies. The encounter escalated into a public tirade, with O'Malley cursing and involving others. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate but left after O'Malley followed him. O'Malley defended his actions, tying them to opposing the administration's policies. Some on the left supported his behavior, raising concerns about public harassment as a political tactic. The incident highlights ethical questions about confronting officials publicly, especially when celebrated by supporters.

That should capture the moral framing without exceeding the word limit.
