SUMMARY:
Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley launched a "shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, with veins bulging on his neck as he screamed and cursed. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation by moving away, but O'Malley followed him, pushing and bumping against him, and inviting him to "take a swing." O'Malley's behavior was described as "sad and shocking." The incident ended with Cuccinelli seeking refuge with friends. O'Malley later justified his actions by accusing Cuccinelli, whose grandparents were immigrants, of "caging children for a fascist president." This incident highlights the toxic political climate where harassment of officials is celebrated by some, and where moral grandstanding takes precedence over civil discourse. END OF SUMMARY.
