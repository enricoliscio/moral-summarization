SUMMARY:

Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a Washington, D.C. bar, berating him over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley's "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" was so intense that Cuccinelli's neck veins were "bulging." The confrontation escalated, with O'Malley following Cuccinelli and continuing to curse at him. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation, but O'Malley's behavior was "sad" and "shocking." The incident is particularly egregious given O'Malley's status as a prominent Democrat. Moreover, the left has celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg expressing approval. This incident is morally reprehensible, promoting a culture of harassment and intolerance. It is unacceptable for public officials to be subjected to such behavior, and it is even more disturbing that some are condoning it. END OF SUMMARY.
