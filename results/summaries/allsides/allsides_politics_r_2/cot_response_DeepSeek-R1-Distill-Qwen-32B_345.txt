Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand what happened. Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was at a bar in Washington, D.C., when Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley confronted him. O'Malley was angry about the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the separation of immigrant children from their parents, which he called "caging children." The encounter got heated, with O'Malley cursing and yelling, even following Cuccinelli to different bars. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate the situation by pointing out that some of O'Malley's criticisms actually applied to Obama's policies, which O'Malley didn't appreciate. After a friend intervened, the situation calmed down. O'Malley later defended his actions, saying it was about expressing their feelings against the administration's policies. Some Democrats, including a presidential candidate's adviser, supported O'Malley's actions, which the article criticizes as promoting harassment.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a judgment or value, like "harassed," "shame-invoking," "cussing," "veins bulging," "fascist," "caging," "disgusting," etc. I'll list these out.

Next, I'll write a concise summary, making sure to include these moral terms to preserve the author's framing. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the confrontation, the reasons behind it, the reaction from both parties, and the implications regarding public behavior and political support.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the moral language to reflect the original article's tone and perspective. I'll structure it by starting with the event, then the actions of both individuals, the aftermath, and the reactions from others, highlighting the moral judgments involved.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the facts while maintaining the moral framing. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions beyond what's presented in the article. Let me put it all together, keeping it within the word limit and using the identified moral terms appropriately.
