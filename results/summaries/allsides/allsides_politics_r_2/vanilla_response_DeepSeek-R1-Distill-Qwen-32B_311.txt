Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about an incident where Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, at a bar in Washington, D.C. They were both attending a high school reunion event.

So, the main points are: O'Malley confronted Cuccinelli over Trump's immigration policies, which involved a heated argument. Cuccinelli describes O'Malley as screaming and cursing, even mentioning that his neck veins were bulging. O'Malley also had friends who joined in, and he followed Cuccinelli to another bar. Eventually, a mutual friend intervened, and Cuccinelli left the scene.

Cuccinelli is upset about the public harassment and mentions that O'Malley's behavior was loud enough that others heard him. O'Malley later defended his actions, saying he was expressing feelings about the administration's policies, especially regarding immigrant children in cages. Some Democrats, including a campaign advisor, supported O'Malley's actions, which has sparked debate about public harassment of officials.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating who was involved, the event, the confrontation, and the aftermath. I should mention the key details like the venue, the reason for the argument, the physical confrontation, and the reactions from both parties. Also, note the political implications and the support O'Malley received.

Let me structure it: Introduction of the incident, description of the confrontation, Cuccinelli's reaction, O'Malley's defense, and the broader reaction. Keep it concise and make sure to include all main points without getting too detailed.

I should avoid any markdown and just write the summary in plain text, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. Also, remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence covers a main point without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to stay under 200.
