SUMMARY:
Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C., subjecting him to a shame-invoking tirade over the Trump administration’s immigration policies. O'Malley screamed and cursed at Cuccinelli, with veins bulging on his neck, inspiring his apparent buddies to join in the cussing assault. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation by moving away, but O'Malley confronted him, bumped up against him, and invited him to take a swing. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking." O'Malley later defended his actions, stating that he was expressing his disapproval of the administration's policy of caging refugee immigrant children. This incident highlights the growing trend of public harassment against Trump administration officials, with some on the left celebrating such acts of aggression. A senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate even appeared to promote the harassment, drawing criticism for normalizing such behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
