SUMMARY:
Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a shame-invoking tirade over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, specifically the caging of immigrant refugee children. O'Malley's behavior was described as "sad" and "shocking," with veins bulging in his neck as he screamed and cursed at Cuccinelli, even pushing and bumping up against him. O'Malley showed no remorse, stating that Cuccinelli, the "son of immigrant grandparents," cages children for a fascist president. This incident highlights the growing trend of public harassment towards Trump administration officials, with some on the left celebrating such actions.
