Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they likely need a concise yet morally charged summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at a bar. O’Malley confronted him with a tirade over immigration policies, leading to a confrontation where O’Malley cursed and even encouraged others to join in. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate but had to leave. The author uses words like "harassed," "cussing," and "cages," which are morally charged.

I need to include as many of these words as possible. I'll structure the summary to highlight the harassment, the confrontation, and the moral implications. I should mention the context of the event, the pub setting, and the reaction from others, including the left celebrating the harassment.

I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words, starting with the key event, then the details of the confrontation, and end with the broader impact. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral language used.

SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a graduate event. O’Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, cursing and confronting him in front of others. Cuccinelli described O’Malley’s behavior as shocking and sad, noting that his neck veins were bulging as he cursed and even inspired others to join in. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation but was followed by O’Malley, who bumped into him and challenged him to fight. A mutual friend intervened, allowing Cuccinelli to leave. O’Malley later defended his actions, stating he was expressing outrage over the administration’s policy of putting refugee children in cages. The incident, which some on the left celebrated, highlights the tension between political opposition and public harassment. Cuccinelli criticized O’Malley’s behavior, noting its oddity given its resemblance to criticisms of Obama’s policies. The event marks a notable instance of public harassment of a Trump administration official by a prominent Democrat. END OF SUMMARY.
