SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed and verbally assaulted by Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the caging of immigrant refugee children. O'Malley's aggressive behavior included cursing, screaming, and even physical intimidation as he bumped up against Cuccinelli and invited him to take a swing at him. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation, but O'Malley followed and continued the harassment. The incident has sparked controversy, with some celebrating the harassment and others criticizing it as disgusting and inappropriate. O'Malley, unapologetic, justified his actions by referring to the Jesuit teachings at Gonzaga, stating that caging children goes against their values. This incident highlights the moral dilemma surrounding the Trump administration's immigration policies and the strong emotions they evoke.
END OF SUMMARY.
