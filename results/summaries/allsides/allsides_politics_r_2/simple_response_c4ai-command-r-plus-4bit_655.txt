SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C., subjecting him to a vitriolic tirade over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley's behavior, which included cursing and screaming, was so aggressive and inappropriate that Cuccinelli was forced to leave the event. The incident is a troubling example of political harassment, with O'Malley justifying his actions by referring to the Jesuit teachings of their shared alma mater. Even more disturbing is the celebration of this harassment by some on the left, including a senior adviser to a Democratic presidential candidate. This incident reflects a concerning trend of politicizing personal interactions and normalizing public shaming and harassment. It is important to uphold civility and respect in political discourse, even when there are strong disagreements, and to remember that such behavior is unacceptable and detrimental to a healthy democratic society. END OF SUMMARY.
