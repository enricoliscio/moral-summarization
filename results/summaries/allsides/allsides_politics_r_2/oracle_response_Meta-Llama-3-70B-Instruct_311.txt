SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli, cursing and screaming at him over the Trump administration's immigration policies. The verbal assault was so intense that Cuccinelli's neck veins were "bulging." O'Malley even inspired others to join in the cussing assault. When Cuccinelli tried to deescalate the situation, O'Malley followed him, bumping into him and inviting him to take a swing. The behavior was described as "sad" and "shocking." O'Malley showed no regrets, justifying his actions by claiming Cuccinelli was "caging children for a fascist president." The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate expressing happiness over the incident. The promotion of harassment of officials is deemed "disgusting."

END OF SUMMARY.
