Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about an incident where Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, at a bar in Washington, D.C. They were both attending a Gonzaga College High School event. O'Malley started a heated argument about Trump's immigration policies, which involved a lot of cursing and even some physical confrontation. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate the situation by moving to another bar, but O'Malley followed. Eventually, a mutual friend intervened. O'Malley later defended his actions, saying he was expressing his opposition to the administration's policies. The article also mentions that some Democrats celebrated this public harassment, which is a significant point. I should make sure to include the key elements: who was involved, where it happened, the reason for the confrontation, the reaction from both parties, and the broader implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I should end with the required tokens. Let me structure this step by step.
