SUMMARY: Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley publicly confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C., over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley launched into a loud and aggressive tirade, criticizing Cuccinelli and the President for their handling of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli recalled that O'Malley's veins were "bulging" as he cursed and screamed, and even physically bumped up against Cuccinelli, inviting him to take a swing. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation and walked away, but O'Malley followed him and continued the confrontation. O'Malley later defended his behavior, stating that he and others expressed their disapproval of Cuccinelli's role in "caging children for a fascist president." This incident has sparked discussions about the appropriateness of publicly harassing government officials and the role of political leaders in promoting or condoning such behavior.
