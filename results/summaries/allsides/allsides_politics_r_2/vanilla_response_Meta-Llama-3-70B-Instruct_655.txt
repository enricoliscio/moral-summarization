SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred when the two ran into each other at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School. O'Malley launched a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with the governor's neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. The situation escalated, with O'Malley following Cuccinelli to another part of the bar and continuing to confront him. The incident eventually ended when a Democrat friend intervened and forced a friendly conversation between the two. O'Malley showed no regrets about his behavior, and some Democrats even celebrated the harassment.

END OF SUMMARY.
