SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The two crossed paths at an event for Gonzaga College High School graduates, where O'Malley launched a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with the governor's neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. O'Malley followed Cuccinelli to another part of the bar, continuing to confront him, but eventually backed down after a Democrat friend intervened. O'Malley showed no regrets, saying he was upset about the administration's treatment of immigrant children. The incident is not the first time a Trump administration official has been publicly harassed, but it is notable for being done by a prominent Democrat.

END OF SUMMARY.
