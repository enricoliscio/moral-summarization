SUMMARY:
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with veins "bulging" on his neck. O'Malley's "cussing assault" continued even after Cuccinelli tried to deescalate the situation. The incident was celebrated by some on the left, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg appearing to condone the harassment. The episode is a disturbing example of the "disgusting" behavior that has become increasingly common in American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
