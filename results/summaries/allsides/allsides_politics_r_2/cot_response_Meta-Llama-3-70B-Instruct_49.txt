SUMMARY:
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with his neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. The situation escalated, with O'Malley pushing his way through the crowd to confront Cuccinelli face-to-face, inviting him to take a swing. The incident was widely criticized, with many calling O'Malley's behavior "disgusting" and "fascist." The left, however, celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg appearing to condone the behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
