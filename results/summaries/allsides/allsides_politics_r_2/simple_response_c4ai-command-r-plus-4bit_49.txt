SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli in an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. Cuccinelli was attempting to enjoy a quiet drink when O'Malley launched into a "shame-invoking tirade" about the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the caging of immigrant children. O'Malley's behavior was aggressive and included cursing and screaming, with veins bulging in his neck. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation by moving away, but O'Malley followed and continued the harassment, even making physical contact. Cuccinelli showed remarkable restraint and moral fortitude by refusing to sink to O'Malley's level, instead choosing to take the high road and de-escalate the situation. The incident reflects poorly on O'Malley and those who celebrate such harassment, demonstrating a lack of respect for civil discourse and basic human decency. It is a sad reflection of the current political climate when a public official cannot enjoy a quiet drink without being subjected to such an aggressive and shameful display.
END OF SUMMARY.
