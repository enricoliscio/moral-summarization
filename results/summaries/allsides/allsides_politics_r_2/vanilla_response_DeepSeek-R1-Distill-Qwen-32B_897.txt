Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about an incident where Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C. They were both attending a Gonzaga College High School event. O'Malley started a heated argument with Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically about caging refugee children. 

Cuccinelli described the encounter as a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade." He mentioned that O'Malley was so angry that his neck veins were bulging. O'Malley also had some friends join in the confrontation, and he followed Cuccinelli to another bar. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate the situation by telling O'Malley that one of them had to rise above it, which wasn't him. Eventually, a mutual friend intervened, allowing Cuccinelli to leave the situation.

O'Malley later told The Washington Post that he and others expressed their feelings about Cuccinelli's role in the administration's policies. He also criticized Cuccinelli's Italian ancestry, which is a bit odd. Cuccinelli noted that some of the criticism actually applied to Obama's policies, which O'Malley didn't appreciate. 

This isn't the first time a Trump admin official was harassed, but it's notable because it's a prominent Democrat doing it. Some on the left celebrated the harassment, which is concerning because it's not appropriate to target officials publicly like that.

So, the summary should include the key points: who was involved, where it happened, what they argued about, the nature of the confrontation, and the aftermath, including O'Malley's comments and the reaction from the left. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the main events without too much detail.

I should structure it by introducing the incident, describing the confrontation, the outcome, and the reactions. I'll make sure to mention the venue, the reason for their meeting, the specifics of the argument, and the notable aspects like O'Malley's anger and the political implications.

Let me start drafting the summary. First, mention the event: O'Malley confronting Cuccinelli at the bar. Then, the reason for their meeting. Next, the heated argument about immigration policies, specifically the caging of children. Include Cuccinelli's description of the confrontation, O'Malley's anger, and the intervention by a friend. Then, O'Malley's later comments and the reaction from the left supporting the harassment. Finally, note that this is unusual for a prominent Democrat to do this and the implications.

I need to ensure that each sentence is concise and that the flow makes sense. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward without any unnecessary details. Let me check the word count as I go to make sure it's under 200 words.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
