Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about an incident where Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, at a bar. They were both at an event for Gonzaga College High School graduates. O'Malley started a heated argument with Cuccinelli, criticizing the Trump administration's immigration policies, especially the separation of children from their parents. Cuccinelli described the encounter as a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade." O'Malley was so aggressive that Cuccinelli had to leave the bar to de-escalate the situation. O'Malley followed him, cursed, and even made personal attacks, including mentioning Cuccinelli's Italian ancestry. Cuccinelli tried to calm things down but eventually had to leave the pub.

The author seems to present this as an example of harassment, especially since O'Malley is a prominent Democrat and the left celebrated this action. There's a moral judgment here about the appropriateness of such public confrontations, suggesting it's wrong to harass government officials, even if you disagree with their policies. The article also notes that this isn't the first time a Trump admin official was harassed, but it's notable because it's a prominent Democrat doing it.

I need to make sure the summary captures the event, the aggression from O'Malley, the reaction from Cuccinelli, and the moral implications. I should mention that O'Malley's actions were seen as harassment and that the left celebrated it, which adds to the moral framing against such behavior.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear that the author is critical of O'Malley's actions, framing it as inappropriate and harmful, even if the policies are controversial.
