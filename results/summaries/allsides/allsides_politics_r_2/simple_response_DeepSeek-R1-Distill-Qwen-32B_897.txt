Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Ken Cuccinelli being harassed by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley at a bar. The key points are the public harassment, the context of immigration policies, and the reactions from both sides. I should highlight the conflict and the moral implications each side presents. Cuccinelli is portrayed as being subjected to a tirade, while O'Malley is justified in his actions based on immigration policies. I also need to mention the celebration from the left and the criticism from the right. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral perspectives are clear.

SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley publicly confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a Gonzaga College High School event. O’Malley unleashed a heated tirade against Cuccinelli, criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including the detention of refugee children. Cuccinelli described the encounter as a "passion-laced and shame-invoking" confrontation, noting that O’Malley’s anger was so intense that his neck veins were "bulging." O’Malley also reportedly recruited others to join the verbal assault, and when Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate, O’Malley followed him, cursing and challenging him to fight. Cuccinelli ultimately left the scene, and later criticized O’Malley’s behavior as "sad and shocking," noting that it was not out of character for the governor. O’Malley, however, defended his actions, stating that he was expressing outrage over the administration’s policies, including the separation of immigrant children from their families. The incident sparked debate, with some on the left celebrating O’Malley’s confrontation, while others condemned the public harassment of a government official. END OF SUMMARY.
