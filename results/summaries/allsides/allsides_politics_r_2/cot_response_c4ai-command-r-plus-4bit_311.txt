SUMMARY:
Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a shame-invoking tirade over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the caging of immigrant refugee children. O'Malley's behavior was described as "fired up," with bulging neck veins, and he even inspired others to join in the cussing assault. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation by walking away, but O'Malley confronted him, bumped against him, and invited him to take a swing. Cuccinelli showed restraint by telling O'Malley that "one of us has to rise above this." O'Malley's behavior was witnessed by others and described as sad and shocking. Despite the incident, O'Malley seemed to have no regrets, doubling down on his criticism of Cuccinelli's role in the Trump administration's immigration policies. This incident highlights the growing trend of public harassment towards Trump administration officials, with some on the left even celebrating such disgraceful actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
