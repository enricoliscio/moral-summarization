SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed and verbally assaulted by Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley, a Democrat, launched into a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the detention of immigrant children. O'Malley's behavior was described as aggressive and bullying, with Cuccinelli noting that the governor's neck veins were "bulging" as he screamed and cursed at him. The incident was witnessed by several people and was loud enough to be heard across the pub. O'Malley showed no remorse for his actions, doubling down on his criticism of Cuccinelli and the Trump administration's immigration policies. This incident highlights the increasingly toxic and polarized nature of political discourse in the United States, where public harassment and intimidation of political opponents are becoming more common and are even celebrated by some. It is a sad reflection of the state of political discourse when a public official cannot enjoy a quiet drink without being subjected to such an aggressive and disrespectful tirade. END OF SUMMARY.
