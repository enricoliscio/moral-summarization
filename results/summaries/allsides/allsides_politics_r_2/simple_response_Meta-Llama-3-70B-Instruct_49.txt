SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of public harassment, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley verbally attacked Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The two crossed paths at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School, where O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with bulging neck veins and cursing. Despite attempts to deescalate the situation, O'Malley continued to harass Cuccinelli, even following him to another part of the bar. The incident is a disturbing example of the left's celebration of harassment against Trump administration officials. O'Malley showed no remorse, and senior advisers to Democrat presidential candidates even applauded the behavior. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and promotes a culture of intimidation and hostility. END OF SUMMARY.
