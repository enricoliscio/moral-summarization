SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at a Washington, D.C. bar, The Dubliner. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" on Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the practice of putting immigrant refugee children in cages. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with bulging neck veins as he cursed and screamed. The confrontation escalated when O'Malley followed Cuccinelli to another bar, bumping into him and inviting him to take a swing. The incident was eventually de-escalated by a Democrat friend who intervened. O'Malley showed no remorse, justifying his harassment by citing Cuccinelli's role in implementing the administration's policies. The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg expressing happiness over the incident. The author condemned the behavior as "disgusting" and an example of promoting harassment of officials.
