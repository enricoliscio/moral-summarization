SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley confronted Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, screaming and cursing at him. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation by walking away, but O'Malley followed him and continued the verbal assault, even inviting Cuccinelli to take a swing at him. O'Malley later justified his behavior by stating that he was expressing his opposition to the administration's policy of caging immigrant children. This incident has sparked criticism, with some celebrating the harassment and others condemning it as inappropriate behavior for a public official.
