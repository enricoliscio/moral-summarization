Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Ken Cuccinelli being harassed by Martin O'Malley at a bar. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included.

First, I need to read the article thoroughly to understand the key points. Cuccinelli was at a pub when O'Malley confronted him over immigration policies, leading to a public harassment incident. O'Malley cursed and was aggressive, causing Cuccinelli to leave.

Next, I should identify the main elements: who, what, when, where, why. The who is Cuccinelli and O'Malley. The what is the harassment incident. When is during an event at the pub. Where is The Dubliner in DC. Why is because of Trump's immigration policies.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words: harassed, cussing, cursing, assault, confront, bumped, behavior, putting, cages, harassment, happy, disgusting. I'll make sure to use these words where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to include the confrontation, the use of aggressive language, the impact on Cuccinelli, and the reaction from others, especially the celebration by the left. This shows the moral judgment against the harassment.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary details. I'll start with the incident, describe the harassment, mention the policies involved, and conclude with the reactions and implications.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows naturally, using the specified words to maintain the moral tone as per the author's framing. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just present the facts with the given moral language.

SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during an event for Gonzaga College High School graduates. O’Malley launched a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, cursing and screaming so intensely that his neck veins were said to be bulging. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation but was followed by O’Malley, who continued the confrontation, even bumping into him and taunting him to fight. Cuccinelli eventually left the area after a friend intervened. O’Malley’s behavior was described as sad and shocking, with some noting it was not new for him. O’Malley later defended his actions, criticizing Cuccinelli for supporting policies that cage immigrant children. The incident drew mixed reactions, with some on the left celebrating the harassment, while others condemned it as disgusting. Cuccinelli criticized O’Malley’s behavior, noting it was inconsistent with Jesuit teachings and that some of the criticism applied to Obama’s policies. END OF SUMMARY.
