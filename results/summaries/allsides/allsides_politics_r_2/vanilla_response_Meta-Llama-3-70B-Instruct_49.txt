SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred when the two ran into each other at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School. O'Malley launched a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with the governor's neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. O'Malley followed Cuccinelli to another part of the bar, continuing to confront him, but was eventually separated by a mutual friend. Despite the incident, O'Malley showed no regrets, and some Democrats even celebrated the harassment.

END OF SUMMARY.
