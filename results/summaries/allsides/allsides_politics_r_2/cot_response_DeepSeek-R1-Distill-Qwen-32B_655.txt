Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally charged words as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the article again to spot those terms.

The article talks about Ken Cuccinelli being harassed by Martin O'Malley. Words like "harassed," "passion-laced," "shame-invoking tirade," "fascist," and "cages" stand out as they carry strong moral connotations. These words indicate the author's judgment on the actions and policies involved.

Next, I need to summarize the article. I should include the key points: who was involved, what happened, and the reactions. It's important to keep the moral language intact to reflect the author's framing. I'll mention the harassment, the context of immigration policies, the confrontation details, and the aftermath where O'Malley defended his actions while others criticized the harassment.

I should also note the political implications, such as the support from the left and the criticism from the right, to show the broader impact of the incident. Keeping the summary concise, under 200 words, while including all these elements is crucial. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects without adding my own bias, just reflecting what's in the article.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the incident, then the confrontation, followed by the reactions, and ending with the political fallout. This should provide a clear and morally framed summary as the user requested.

**SUMMARY:**  

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a Gonzaga College High School event. O’Malley unleashed a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including the controversial practice of caging refugee children. O’Malley’s anger was so intense that his neck veins were bulging, and he even inspired his associates to join in the verbal assault. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation but was followed by O’Malley, who continued to curse and confront him. Cuccinelli eventually left the bar to avoid further conflict. O’Malley later defended his actions, stating he was expressing outrage over the administration’s policies. The incident sparked debate, with some on the left celebrating the harassment, while others criticized it as disgusting.
