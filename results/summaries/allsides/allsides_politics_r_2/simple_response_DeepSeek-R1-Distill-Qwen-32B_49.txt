Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ken Cuccinelli being harassed by Martin O'Malley at a bar. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article describes an incident where Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. They were both attending a high school reunion event. O'Malley started a heated tirade against Cuccinelli over Trump's immigration policies, specifically about detaining immigrant children. The author uses strong language like "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" and mentions that O'Malley's veins were bulging, indicating he was really angry.

Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate the situation by moving to another bar, but O'Malley followed him and continued the confrontation, even mentioning Cuccinelli's Italian ancestry. Cuccinelli's friend, a Democrat, intervened, but the situation was still tense. Cuccinelli later said O'Malley's behavior was sad and shocking, and that others had seen this behavior before. O'Malley defended his actions, saying he was expressing opposition to the administration's policies. The article also notes that the left celebrated this harassment, with a Democratic presidential candidate's adviser approving of it.

The user wants the summary to capture the moral framing. So, I need to highlight the key points: the public harassment, the policies it was about, the reaction from both parties, and the moral implications like whether such behavior is acceptable in public discourse.

I should structure the summary to include the main actors, the event, the reason behind it, the confrontation details, and the reactions. Also, note that this is the first time a prominent Democrat did this, and that some on the left supported it, which adds to the moral debate.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. Make sure to mention the pub, the reason for the confrontation, the physical reaction from O'Malley, Cuccinelli's attempt to leave, the intervention, and the aftermath with O'Malley's defense and the left's support.

I should avoid any personal opinions, just stick to the facts but ensure the moral framing is clear. So, the summary should show that O'Malley's actions were confrontational and that it's notable that a Democrat did this, with some support from the left, which raises questions about public discourse and harassment.
