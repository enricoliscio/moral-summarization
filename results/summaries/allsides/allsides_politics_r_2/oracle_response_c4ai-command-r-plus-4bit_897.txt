SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the caging of immigrant refugee children. O'Malley's aggressive behavior included cursing, screaming, and even physical intimidation as he bumped up against Cuccinelli and invited him to take a swing at him. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation and walked away, but O'Malley followed and continued the harassment. The incident has been celebrated by some on the left, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate appearing to condone the harassment. This behavior is disgusting and sets a dangerous precedent for the public harassment of government officials. It is a sad and shocking display of behavior by a prominent Democrat.
END OF SUMMARY.
