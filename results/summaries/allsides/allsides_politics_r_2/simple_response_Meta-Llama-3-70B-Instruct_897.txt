SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of public harassment, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley verbally attacked Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred when the two crossed paths at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli, criticizing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The verbal assault was so intense that Cuccinelli's neck veins were "bulging." O'Malley even followed Cuccinelli to another part of the bar, continuing to curse and scream at him. The incident is not only disturbing but also morally reprehensible, especially since O'Malley showed no remorse for his behavior. Furthermore, the left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate praising the incident. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and promotes a culture of harassment and intimidation. END OF SUMMARY.
