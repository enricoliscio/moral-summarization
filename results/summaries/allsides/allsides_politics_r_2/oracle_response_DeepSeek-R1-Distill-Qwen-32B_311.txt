Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley confronting Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar. O’Malley was upset about the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the caging of refugee children. He confronted Cuccinelli in a public setting, using harsh language and even encouraging others to join in. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate the situation but ended up leaving the bar. O’Malley didn't regret his actions, and some Democrats, including a presidential candidate's adviser, seemed to approve.

The author used words like "harassed," "cussing," "cursing," "assault," "confront," "bumped," "behavior," "putting," "cages," "harassment," "happy," and "disgusting." These words carry strong moral connotations, so I need to include them in the summary.

I should structure the summary to include the main event: O’Malley harassing Cuccinelli at the bar. I'll mention the context of the event, the confrontation, the language used, and the aftermath where O’Malley's actions were supported by some Democrats. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the specified moral words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a Gonzaga College High School event. O’Malley unleashed a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade against Cuccinelli, cursing and screaming about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including the caging of refugee children. Cuccinelli described O’Malley’s behavior as “sad and shocking,” noting his neck veins were bulging. O’Malley also inspired others to join in the cussing assault, following Cuccinelli to different bars. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate but ultimately left the pub. O’Malley later defended his actions, stating he was expressing outrage over the administration’s policies. Some Democrats, including a senior adviser to a presidential candidate, celebrated the harassment, calling it a justified response to the administration’s actions. Cuccinelli criticized O’Malley’s behavior, pointing out its inconsistency with Jesuit teachings and the governor’s own immigrant heritage. The incident highlights the tension between political confrontation and public decorum, with some viewing the harassment as disgusting and others as a form of protest. END OF SUMMARY.
