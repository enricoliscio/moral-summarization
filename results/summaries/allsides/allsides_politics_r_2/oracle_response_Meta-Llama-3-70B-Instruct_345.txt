SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at a Washington, D.C. bar. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with veins "bulging" on his neck as he cursed and screamed. O'Malley even inspired others to join in the "cussing assault." When Cuccinelli tried to deescalate the situation, O'Malley followed him, bumping into him and inviting him to take a swing. The harassment was so loud that people on the other side of the pub heard it. O'Malley showed no regrets, stating that Cuccinelli was "the son of immigrant grandparents who cages children for a fascist president." The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate appearing "happy" about the incident. This promotion of harassment is "disgusting."

END OF SUMMARY.
