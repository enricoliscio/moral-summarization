SUMMARY: Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley publicly confronted Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a bar in Washington, D.C., over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley launched into a profanity-laced tirade, criticizing Cuccinelli and the President for their handling of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as aggressive and shame-invoking, with veins bulging on his neck. O'Malley followed Cuccinelli to another bar within the pub and continued the confrontation, even inviting Cuccinelli to take a swing at him. Cuccinelli de-escalated the situation and walked away. O'Malley later defended his actions, stating that he was expressing his disapproval of the administration's policies on refugee immigrant children. This incident highlights the tension between Democrats and the Trump administration over immigration issues.
