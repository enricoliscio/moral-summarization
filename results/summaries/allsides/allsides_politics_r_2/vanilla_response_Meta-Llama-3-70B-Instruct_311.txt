SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred when the two ran into each other at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School. O'Malley launched a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, specifically the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with the governor's neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. Despite attempts to deescalate the situation, O'Malley continued to confront Cuccinelli, even following him to another part of the bar. The incident has sparked controversy, with some celebrating the harassment and others condemning it as unacceptable behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
