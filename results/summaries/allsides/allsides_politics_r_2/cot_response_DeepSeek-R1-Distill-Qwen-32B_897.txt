Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand what's happening. It's about Ken Cuccinelli being harassed by Martin O'Malley at a bar. The user wants me to identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary.

In STEP 1, I have to find all the single words that carry moral implications. I'll go through the article and pick out words that express judgment or evaluation. Words like "harassed," "passion-laced," "shame-invoking," "fascist," "cages," "disgusting," and "harassment" stand out as they carry strong moral connotations. These words are used to convey disapproval or criticism.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping those moral words. I'll start by stating that Cuccinelli was harassed by O'Malley. I'll mention the setting, the pub, and the context of the event. Then, I'll describe O'Malley's tirade, the confrontation, and the reaction from others, including the left celebrating the harassment. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the main points: the incident, the reaction from both parties, and the broader implications. I'll avoid adding any new information and stick strictly to the content provided. Keeping it concise while preserving the moral elements is crucial here.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's under 200 words and that all the important details are included without losing the moral framing. This way, the user gets a clear, morally charged summary of the event.

**SUMMARY:**  
Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a Gonzaga College High School event. O’Malley unleashed a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including the controversial practice of caging refugee children. The confrontation became so heated that O’Malley’s neck veins were bulging, and he reportedly cursed and screamed at Cuccinelli, even pushing through a group to confront him face to face. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation but was ultimately forced to leave the pub. O’Malley later defended his actions, stating he was expressing outrage over the administration’s policies. The incident sparked controversy, with some on the left celebrating the harassment, while others criticized it as disgusting. Cuccinelli described O’Malley’s behavior as sad and shocking, noting that it was not new for the governor.
