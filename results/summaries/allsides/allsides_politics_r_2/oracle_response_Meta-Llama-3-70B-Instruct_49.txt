SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with "veins bulging" on his neck as he cursed and screamed. O'Malley even inspired others to join in the "cussing assault." When Cuccinelli tried to deescalate the situation, O'Malley followed him, bumping into him and inviting him to take a swing. The incident was met with celebration from the left, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate expressing happiness over the harassment. This behavior is "disgusting" and promotes harassment of officials. END OF SUMMARY.
