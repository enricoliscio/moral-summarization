SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed and verbally assaulted by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at a bar in Washington, D.C. O’Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a loud and aggressive tirade, cursing and screaming about the Trump administration’s immigration policies. O’Malley's behavior was described as "sad and shocking," with Cuccinelli noting that the governor's veins were bulging as he screamed in his face. The incident occurred at an event for graduates of Gonzaga College High School, and O’Malley's behavior was witnessed by several people in the pub. O’Malley showed no remorse for his actions, stating that he and others had let Cuccinelli know their feelings about "putting refugee immigrant kids in cages." This incident is another example of the public harassment and political harassment of Trump administration officials, and the celebration of such behavior by some on the left. The senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate even appeared to condone the harassment, a disgusting promotion of political harassment.
END OF SUMMARY.
