Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley confronting Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary, at a bar in Washington, D.C. They both attended a Gonzaga College High School event. O’Malley started a heated argument with Cuccinelli over Trump's immigration policies, calling him names and even involving his buddies. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate but had to leave the bar. O’Malley later defended his actions, saying they were against Trump's policies. Some Democrats supported him, but others found it disturbing. The summary needs to capture the main points: who, what, where, why, and the reactions. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key events and avoid too many details. Make sure to include that it's the first time a prominent Democrat did this and the reactions from both sides. Okay, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it all together concisely.
