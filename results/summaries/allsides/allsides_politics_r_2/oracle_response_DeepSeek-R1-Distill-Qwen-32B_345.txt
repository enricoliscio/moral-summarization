Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and specified that the summary should include as many morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassing Ken Cuccinelli at a bar. The article describes the incident with strong language like "harassed," "cussing," "assault," etc. 

I should identify the morally framed words used by the author: harassed, cussing, cursing, assault, confront, bumped, take, behavior, putting, cages, harassment, happy, disgusting. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main events: O'Malley confronts Cuccinelli, uses profanity, criticizes Trump's immigration policies, and the incident is celebrated by some on the left. 

I'll structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring it's concise (under 200 words) and captures the moral tone. I'll mention the harassment, the use of cursing, the confrontation, and the context of the policies. Also, note the reaction from the left and the criticism against such behavior.

I need to make sure the summary flows naturally, using the specified words without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure clarity.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during an event for Gonzaga College High School graduates. O’Malley unleashed a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade, cursing and confronting Cuccinelli over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, specifically the practice of caging refugee children. O’Malley’s behavior was described as shocking and sad, with his neck veins bulging as he cursed and confronted Cuccinelli, even pushing through a group to get in his face. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation, telling O’Malley, “one of us has to rise above this, and it's obviously not going to be you.” The incident was so loud that people on the other side of the pub heard it. O’Malley later defended his behavior, stating he was expressing opposition to the administration’s policies. The left celebrated the harassment, with some Democratic figures, including a senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg, appearing happy about the confrontation. Critics condemned the behavior as disgusting, arguing that promoting harassment of officials is unacceptable. END OF SUMMARY.
