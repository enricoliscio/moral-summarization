SUMMARY:

Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. over the Trump administration's immigration policies. O'Malley's "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" was so intense that Cuccinelli's neck veins were "bulging." Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation, but O'Malley followed him, cursing and screaming. The situation was eventually diffused by a Democrat friend who intervened. O'Malley showed no regrets, justifying his behavior by citing the administration's treatment of immigrant children. The incident is disturbing not only because of O'Malley's aggressive behavior but also because the left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to a Democrat presidential candidate promoting the incident on social media. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and promotes a culture of harassment and intimidation.

END OF SUMMARY.
