SUMMARY:
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" on Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with his neck veins "bulging" as he screamed and cursed. O'Malley even inspired his friends to join in the "cussing assault." Despite Cuccinelli's attempts to deescalate the situation, O'Malley continued to confront him, even bumping into him and inviting him to take a swing. The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg appearing to condone the behavior. This incident is a disturbing example of the normalization of harassment and the "disgusting" behavior of some Democrats. END OF SUMMARY.
