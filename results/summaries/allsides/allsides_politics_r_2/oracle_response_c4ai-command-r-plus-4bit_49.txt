SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley at a bar in Washington, D.C. O'Malley subjected Cuccinelli to a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the caging of immigrant refugee children. O'Malley's behavior was described as aggressive and included cursing, screaming, and physical intimidation. Cuccinelli attempted to de-escalate the situation by walking away, but O'Malley followed him and continued the harassment, even inviting Cuccinelli to "take a swing at him." The incident has sparked criticism, with some calling it "sad" and "shocking," while others have celebrated the harassment of a Trump administration official. This incident highlights the increasing polarization and breakdown of civility in political discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
