SUMMARY:
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at a Washington, D.C. bar, delivering a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with "veins bulging" on his neck as he cursed and screamed. O'Malley's "cussing assault" was so loud that people on the other side of the pub heard him. Despite Cuccinelli's attempts to deescalate the situation, O'Malley continued to harass him, even following him to another part of the bar. The left celebrated the harassment, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg expressing happiness over the incident. This "disgusting" behavior promotes a culture of harassment and is unacceptable.
END OF SUMMARY.
