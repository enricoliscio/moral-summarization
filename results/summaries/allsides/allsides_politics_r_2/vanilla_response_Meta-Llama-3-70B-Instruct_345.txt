SUMMARY:

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. The two ran into each other at an event for Gonzaga College High School graduates. O'Malley launched a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," saying his neck veins were "bulging" during the confrontation. O'Malley followed Cuccinelli to another part of the bar, continuing to curse and scream at him. The situation was eventually de-escalated by a Democrat friend who intervened. O'Malley showed no regrets about his behavior, saying he was upset about the administration's treatment of immigrant children. The incident has sparked controversy, with some celebrating the harassment and others condemning it as unacceptable behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
