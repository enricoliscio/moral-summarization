SUMMARY:
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley publicly harassed Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C. O'Malley unleashed a "passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade" against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the treatment of immigrant refugee children. Cuccinelli described O'Malley's behavior as "sad" and "shocking," with his neck veins "bulging" as he cursed and screamed. The situation escalated, with O'Malley following Cuccinelli and continuing to berate him. The incident was celebrated by some on the left, with a senior adviser to Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg praising the harassment. This incident is particularly disturbing, as it promotes a culture of "disgusting" harassment of public officials. END OF SUMMARY.
