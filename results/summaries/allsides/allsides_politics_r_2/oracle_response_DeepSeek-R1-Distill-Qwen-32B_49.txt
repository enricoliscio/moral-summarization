Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. 

The article describes an incident where Ken Cuccinelli was harassed by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley at a bar. O'Malley confronted him over immigration policies, leading to a public tirade. Cuccinelli tried to de-escalate but had to leave. O'Malley's actions were supported by some on the left, which is problematic.

I should highlight the harassment, the use of cursing, and the confrontational behavior. Also, note the moral judgment on both sides—the harassment and the celebration of it. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the specified moral terms.

Let me structure it: start with the harassment, describe the confrontation, mention the public reaction, and conclude with the implications. Make sure to use words like "harassed," "cussing," "assault," "confront," etc.

I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all key points with the moral framing intact. Then, I'll check the word count and ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli was publicly harassed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley at an Irish pub in Washington, D.C., during a graduate event. O’Malley launched a passion-laced, shame-invoking tirade against Cuccinelli over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, cursing and confronting him. Cuccinelli described O’Malley’s behavior as shocking, noting his neck veins were bulging as he cursed and even inspired others to join in. Cuccinelli attempted to deescalate the situation but was followed by O’Malley, who bumped into him and invited a physical confrontation. A friend intervened, allowing Cuccinelli to leave. O’Malley later defended his actions, calling out Cuccinelli for supporting policies that cage refugee children. The incident sparked debate, with some on the left celebrating the harassment, while others condemned it as disgusting. Cuccinelli criticized O’Malley’s behavior, pointing out its inconsistency with Jesuit teachings and the fact that some criticisms applied to Obama’s policies. The event marked a rare instance of a prominent Democrat publicly harassing a Trump administration official. END OF SUMMARY.
