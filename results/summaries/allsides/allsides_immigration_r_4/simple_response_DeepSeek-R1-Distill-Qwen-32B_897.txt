Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order. It uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats to illustrate how lax enforcement can undermine the rule of law. The author emphasizes deterrence, arguing that without consequences, people feel emboldened to break laws, leading to chaos.

I should highlight the key points: the role of law enforcement beyond individual cases, the concept of deterrence, examples provided, and the potential for anarchy if laws aren't enforced. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral argument about the necessity of enforcing laws to maintain civilization.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main idea, then mention the examples, and conclude with the implications of ignoring the rule of law. I'll make sure to use the moral framing, such as the consequences of not enforcing laws leading to broader societal issues.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the critical role of law enforcement in maintaining societal order and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, not just moral character, drives compliance with laws. The author uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats to illustrate how lax enforcement emboldens lawbreakers and weakens the rule of law. Sanctuary cities and unchecked illegal immigration are seen as signaling that laws can be ignored, leading to broader societal disorder. The article warns that ignoring laws is contagious and can boomerang, potentially justifying exemptions for other groups or issues. It concludes that without enforced laws, civilization risks descending into anarchy, where high-minded ideals like freedom and rights mean nothing without a functioning legal system to uphold them. END OF SUMMARY.
