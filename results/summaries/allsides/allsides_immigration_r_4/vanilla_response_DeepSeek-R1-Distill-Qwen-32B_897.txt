Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about law enforcement and its role in maintaining societal order. It mentions examples like migrant caravans, campus protests, and threats against the president. The key idea seems to be that when laws aren't enforced, it leads to more lawlessness because people don't fear consequences. 

The article uses George Savile's quote about why people aren't hanged for stealing horses, which is to deter others. It also brings up sanctuary cities and the presence of undocumented immigrants as examples where lack of enforcement weakens the law. It then moves on to campus protests where students disrupt events without facing punishment, leading to more such incidents. Celebrities threatening the president without consequences is another point. 

The author argues that without deterrence, people assume they can act with impunity, especially if they're influential or famous. They also mention that legal laxity can create a boomerang effect, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or other issues. The conclusion ties back to the importance of law enforcement to uphold the rule of law.

So, the summary should highlight the importance of law enforcement as a deterrent, the consequences of not enforcing laws, examples provided, and the potential for the problem to escalate if not addressed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement as a deterrent to maintain societal order. It argues that fear of punishment, rather than moral character, drives compliance with laws. Examples include the migrant caravan in Mexico, campus protests, and celebrities threatening the president without consequences. The presence of sanctuary cities and undocumented immigrants in the U.S. weakens immigration laws, signaling that laws can be ignored. Similarly, unpunished student disruptions and violent protests encourage more lawlessness. The article warns that ignoring laws can lead to a boomerang effect, potentially creating conservative sanctuary zones or exempting future mass arrivals. It concludes that without enforcement, high-minded ideals about rights mean little, emphasizing the need for consistent law enforcement to uphold the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
