SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that the lack of consequences for violators can lead to chaos. The author cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against the president, suggesting that when laws are not enforced, it sends a message that they can be ignored. This creates a culture of impunity, where individuals feel they can disregard the law without consequence. The author argues that this approach can boomerang, leading to a breakdown in social order and the erosion of the rule of law. The article concludes that without the threat of punishment, laws become meaningless, and that a functioning society requires a balance between freedom and force.
