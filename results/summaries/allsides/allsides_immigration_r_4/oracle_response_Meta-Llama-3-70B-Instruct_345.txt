SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without consequences, individuals are more likely to disobey laws, leading to anarchy. The author cites examples of unpunished protesters, illegal immigrants, and celebrities who fantasize about harming the president, all of whom assume they are above the law. This laxity has consequences, as it greenlights others to follow suit, weakening the rule of law. The result is a breakdown in social order, as seen in the migrant caravan and violent campus protests. The author suggests that if laws were enforced, and individuals faced consequences for their actions, deterrence would be reestablished, and such incidents would decrease. The article concludes that without the cop on the beat and the local district attorney, all talk about the Bill of Rights means nothing, and anarchy will ensue.
