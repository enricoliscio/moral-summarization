SUMMARY:
The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that fear of punishment is a key factor in making citizens comply with laws. The lack of deterrence and the ignoring of laws have led to the current situation where protesters and illegal immigrants feel they can act with impunity. The article cites examples of campus protests turning violent, celebrities fantasizing about harming the president, and politicians being harassed in public without consequences. It warns that this legal laxity is contagious and can boomerang, leading to anarchy and the undermining of the rule of law. The article concludes that without the cop on the beat and the local district attorney, all talk about the Bill of Rights means nothing. END OF SUMMARY.
