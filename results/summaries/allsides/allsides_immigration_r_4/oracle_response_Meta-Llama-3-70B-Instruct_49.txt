SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without it, individuals are more likely to disregard laws, leading to a breakdown in social order. The fear of punishment, such as fines or imprisonment, is often what compels citizens to comply with laws. When laws are left unenforced, it sends a message that they can be ignored, leading to a weakening of the entire legal system. This is evident in the case of "sanctuary cities" and the estimated 12 million foreign nationals living in the US without legal consequence. The lack of enforcement has led to the current caravan of Central Americans attempting to enter the US illegally. The article also highlights how campus protests often turn violent, with disrupters assuming they will face no consequences. Similarly, celebrities who have fantasized about harming the president assume they are above the law. The author concludes that ignoring laws has contagious consequences and can boomerang, leading to anarchy and a loss of freedom.
