SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without fear of punishment, citizens may not comply with laws, leading to anarchy. The author cites examples of lawlessness, such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrities fantasizing about harming the president. These instances demonstrate how ignoring laws can have far-reaching consequences, weakening the rule of law and emboldening others to break the law. The author emphasizes that deterrence is key to maintaining order, and that unpunished violators can greenlight hundreds more like them. The article also notes that legal laxity can boomerang, with sanctuary cities potentially inspiring conservative sanctuary zones. Ultimately, the author argues that without enforcement, our high-minded talk about the Bill of Rights means nothing, and that anarchy is law and freedom without force. END OF SUMMARY.
