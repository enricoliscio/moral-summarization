SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that the lack of consequences for violating laws leads to chaos. It cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against the President, where individuals believe they are above the law. The author contends that when laws are not enforced, it sends a message that they can be ignored, leading to a breakdown in society. The article suggests that if individuals were held accountable for their actions, such as being arrested and charged, it would serve as a deterrent and prevent further lawlessness. The author also notes that the current legal laxity is contagious and can have unintended consequences, such as the creation of conservative sanctuary zones. The article concludes that without law enforcement, there can be no civilization, and that the rule of law must be upheld to maintain social order.
