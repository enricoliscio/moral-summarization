SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and legality. The fear of punishment plays a significant role in deterring individuals from breaking the law and reminding society of the importance of legality. When laws are left unenforced, it weakens the overall legal system and can lead to a breakdown of law and order. This is evident in the current migrant caravan heading towards the US-Mexico border, as a secure border and enforced immigration laws would likely deter illegal entry. Similarly, violent campus protests and threats against public figures often go unpunished, leading to a culture of impunity and lawlessness. Celebrities and students alike assume they are immune to consequences for their actions due to their status or influence. However, ignoring laws and condoning unlawful behavior can have far-reaching consequences and set a dangerous precedent. The moral justification of high-minded ends does not warrant unlawful means. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining law and order, citing Immanuel Kant's view on anarchy, and asserts that without enforcement, our rights and freedoms are meaningless.
