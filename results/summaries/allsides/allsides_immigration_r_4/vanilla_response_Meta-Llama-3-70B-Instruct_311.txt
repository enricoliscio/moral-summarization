SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that ignoring laws can have far-reaching consequences. The author cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against the President, noting that when laws are not enforced, it sends a message that they can be ignored. This leads to a breakdown in social order and encourages more illegal behavior. The author suggests that if individuals, including celebrities and protesters, were held accountable for their actions, it would serve as a deterrent and prevent further lawlessness. The article also warns that ignoring laws can be contagious and boomerang, leading to a situation where anyone can pick and choose which laws to follow. The author concludes that without law enforcement, there can be no civilization, and that freedom without force is anarchy.
