SUMMARY: Law enforcement serves as a reminder to society that legality is essential for civilization. The fear of punishment plays a significant role in deterring individuals from breaking the law. However, when laws are left unenforced, it weakens the overall rule of law and can lead to widespread disregard for legal consequences. This is evident in the current situation at the US-Mexico border, where thousands of migrants are attempting to enter the US illegally, likely encouraged by the lack of enforcement of immigration laws and the presence of sanctuary cities. Similarly, violent campus protests and threats against public figures often go unpunished, creating an environment where lawlessness is tolerated. The article argues that the selective enforcement of laws and the notion of being "above the law" can lead to a breakdown of societal order and contagion of lawlessness. The solution lies in consistent and uniform law enforcement to reestablish deterrence and maintain a functioning society.
