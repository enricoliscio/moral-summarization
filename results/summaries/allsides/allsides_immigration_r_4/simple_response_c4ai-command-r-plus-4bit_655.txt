SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and deterring illegal behavior. The lack of enforcement of laws, such as those related to immigration and peaceful assembly, can have far-reaching consequences, including the encouragement of illegal behavior and the weakening of other laws. The presence of millions of foreign nationals living unlawfully in the US and the recent caravan of Central Americans heading to the US-Mexico border are examples of the failure to enforce immigration laws and the resulting loss of deterrence. Similarly, violent campus protests and threats against public figures go unpunished, sending the message that breaking the law has no consequences. This legal laxity is contagious and can lead to a breakdown of law and order, with some justifying unlawful means to achieve supposedly high-minded ends. The solution lies in effective law enforcement and the understanding that legality is essential for civilization to thrive.
