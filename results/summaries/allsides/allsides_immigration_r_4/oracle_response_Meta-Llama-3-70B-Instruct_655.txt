SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without fear of punishment, citizens may not obey the law, and anarchy can ensue. The lack of enforcement in "sanctuary cities" and the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants send a message that laws can be ignored. This has led to the current caravan of thousands of Central Americans attempting to enter the US illegally. Similarly, campus protests often turn violent, and agitators assume there will be no consequences for disrupting peaceful assembly. Celebrities who fantasize about harming the president also believe they are above the law. The article warns that ignoring laws can have contagious and boomerang effects, leading to a breakdown in social order. It emphasizes the importance of deterrence, enforcement, and consequences to maintain a civilized society. If laws are not enforced, anarchy and lawlessness will prevail. END OF SUMMARY.
