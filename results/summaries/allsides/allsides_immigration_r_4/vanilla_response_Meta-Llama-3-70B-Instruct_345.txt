SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that ignoring laws can have contagious and far-reaching consequences. It cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against the President, where the lack of consequences for violators has led to a culture of lawlessness. The author contends that fear of punishment is what makes citizens obey the law, and that without it, society descends into anarchy. The article also notes that the current legal laxity is fueled by a sense of moral justification among Trump's critics, who believe that extraordinary measures are necessary to stop him. However, this approach can boomerang and lead to a breakdown of law and order. The author concludes that without effective law enforcement, freedom and the Bill of Rights mean nothing.
