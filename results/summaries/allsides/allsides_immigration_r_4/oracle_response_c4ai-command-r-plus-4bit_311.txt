SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and deterring illegal behavior. It argues that the fear of punishment is often a more effective motivator for compliance with laws than individual character. When laws are left unenforced, it weakens the overall legal system and signals that certain laws can be ignored. This has been evident in the recent migrant caravan, where the presence of millions of foreign nationals living unlawfully in the US without legal consequence has effectively greenlit similar behavior. Similarly, violent campus protests and threats against public figures have gone unpunished, leading to a breakdown of law and order. The article also highlights the contagious nature of lawlessness, where ignoring laws in one area can lead to justifying unlawful behavior in other areas as well. It concludes that true freedom and civilization require the force of law enforcement to ensure legality and deter illegal behavior.
