SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintaining civilization, as it reminds society that there can be no civilization without legality. The fear of punishment, rather than sterling character, is what makes citizens obey the law. The author cites examples of lawlessness, such as sanctuary cities, illegal immigration, and violent campus protests, which undermine the rule of law and create a culture of impunity. The article suggests that if laws are not enforced, it can lead to chaos and anarchy. The author also notes that celebrities and politicians who engage in illegal behavior, such as making threats against the president, are often not held accountable, which perpetuates a culture of lawlessness. The article concludes that without law enforcement, society descends into chaos, and that the cop on the beat and the local district attorney are essential to maintaining freedom and the rule of law.
