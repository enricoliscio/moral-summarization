SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and legality. The fear of punishment is often a stronger motivator for compliance than individual character. Deterrence, or the consistent enforcement of laws, is necessary to prevent widespread disregard for the law. Unpunished violations, such as violent campus protests and threats against public figures, create a perception of impunity and weaken the rule of law. Sanctuary cities and the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants send a similar message that U.S. immigration laws can be ignored. The current caravan of Central American migrants heading towards the U.S. is a consequence of this perceived impunity. Celebrities who fantasize about harming the president and protesters who disrupt conservative figures also operate under the assumption that they are above the law. The selective enforcement of laws and the justification of unlawful means for moral ends undermine the very fabric of society. The consequences of this legal laxity could be far-reaching and unpredictable, affecting a range of issues from immigration to abortion rights.
