Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is talking about the importance of law enforcement and how the lack of it can lead to chaos. They use examples like sanctuary cities, illegal immigration, campus protests, and threats against the president to illustrate their point.

I should identify the key morally framed words the author used, such as enforcement, civilization, legality, obey, comply, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of the article without adding my own opinions.

I'll start by highlighting the main idea: law enforcement is crucial for maintaining order and legality in society. Then, I'll mention the examples the author provided, like sanctuary cities and the migrant caravan, showing how ignoring laws leads to more lawlessness. I'll also touch on campus protests and threats against the president, emphasizing that without consequences, these actions encourage more violations.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each example back to the theme of deterrence and the breakdown of law enforcement. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing. Finally, I'll conclude by restating the importance of consistent law enforcement to prevent anarchy.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each paragraph in the summary addresses a key point and uses the necessary moral terms. I'll keep sentences clear and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and legality. It argues that fear of punishment, not just moral character, drives citizens to obey laws. When laws are unenforced, such as in "sanctuary cities" or with undocumented immigrants, it signals that laws can be ignored, leading to chaos. For example, the caravan of Central Americans moving northward is seen as a consequence of lax immigration enforcement. Similarly, campus protests often turn violent when disrupters face no legal consequences, and celebrities threatening the president assume they won't face repercussions. The author warns that ignoring laws is contagious and can boomerang, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or exempting future mass arrivals of immigrants. The article concludes that without consistent law enforcement, high-minded ideals about rights mean little, and anarchy—law and freedom without force—prevails. END OF SUMMARY.
