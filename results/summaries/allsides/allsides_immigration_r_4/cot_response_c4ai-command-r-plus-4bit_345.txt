SUMMARY:
The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and deterring immoral behavior. It argues that the fear of punishment, such as the shame of arrest, fines, or imprisonment, is often what prevents people from breaking the law. Law enforcement serves as a reminder that legality is essential for civilization to function. The article gives examples of how a lack of law enforcement can lead to immoral behavior, such as violent campus protests, celebrity threats against the president, and disruptions targeting conservative politicians. It argues that ignoring laws can have contagious and unintended consequences, such as the rise of sanctuary cities and zones that selectively enforce laws based on ideological preferences. The author cites the example of a caravan of Central American migrants heading to the US, suggesting that a secure border and enforced immigration laws would deter illegal immigration. The article concludes by invoking German philosopher Immanuel Kant's idea that "anarchy is law and freedom without force," emphasizing the need for law enforcement to uphold moral principles and ensure public safety.
