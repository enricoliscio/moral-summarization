SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintaining civilization, as it reminds society that there can be no civilization without legality. The fear of punishment, rather than sterling character, is what makes citizens obey the law. The author cites examples of lawlessness, such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrities threatening the president, to illustrate how ignoring laws can lead to chaos and undermine deterrence. The article suggests that if laws are not enforced, it can create a culture of impunity, where individuals feel they can disregard the law without consequences. The author warns that this can have far-reaching consequences, including the erosion of respect for the law and the rise of anarchy. The article concludes that without the enforcement of laws, our freedoms and rights are meaningless.
