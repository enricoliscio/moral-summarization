SUMMARY:
Law enforcement is essential to maintain legality and civilization. The fear of punishment and shame associated with arrest, fines, and imprisonment serve as deterrents that encourage compliance with the law. However, when laws are not enforced uniformly and promptly, it undermines deterrence and signals that certain laws can be ignored. This is evident in the current immigration debate, where sanctuary cities and the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants send a message that U.S. immigration laws can be flouted without legal consequence. The recent caravan of Central Americans heading to the U.S. further underscores the need for secure borders and enforced immigration laws to reestablish deterrence. Campus protests, often violent in nature, go unpunished as college administrators turn a blind eye. The failure to hold disrupters accountable encourages more unlawful and violent protests. Celebrities who threaten the president and protesters who intimidate conservative politicians and their staff face no legal ramifications, perpetuating a culture of impunity. The selective enforcement of laws and the justification of unlawful means to achieve supposedly high-minded ends is immoral and contagious. It undermines the very fabric of our legal system and can lead to anarchy, as philosopher Immanuel Kant warned. The strength of our Bill of Rights relies on the enforcement of those rights by law enforcement officers and the justice system.
