Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order. It uses examples like migrant caravans, campus protests, celebrity threats, and political disruptions to illustrate how lack of enforcement can lead to a breakdown of the rule of law. The author argues that without consistent deterrence, people will ignore laws, leading to chaos.

I should highlight the key arguments: law enforcement deters违法行为, the consequences of not enforcing laws, and the moral implications when laws are ignored. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective presented.

Let me structure the summary to first state the main idea, then provide examples, and conclude with the consequences of ignoring laws. I'll make sure to mention the caravan, protests, celebrities, and political figures as examples. Also, I should include the philosopher's quote to emphasize the point.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without getting too detailed. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, not just moral character, drives compliance with laws. The author uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats against the president, and political disruptions to illustrate how ignoring laws weakens their authority. When laws are not enforced, it sends a message that they can be disregarded, leading to chaos. The article warns that legal laxity, such as in "sanctuary cities," undermines immigration laws and encourages further violations. Similarly, unchecked protests and threats against public figures erode the rule of law. The author cites George Savile's maxim, "Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen," to stress that consistent enforcement prevents larger societal breakdowns. Without legal deterrence, anarchy risks replacing order, as philosopher Immanuel Kant noted: "anarchy is law and freedom without force." END OF SUMMARY.
