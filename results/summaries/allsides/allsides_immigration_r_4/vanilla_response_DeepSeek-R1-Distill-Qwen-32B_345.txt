Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about a migrant caravan in Mexico and then moves on to discuss law enforcement and deterrence. It mentions that people obey laws not because they're good, but because they fear punishment. It uses George Savile's quote about hanging for stealing horses to illustrate deterrence.

Then it talks about sanctuary cities in the U.S., which ignore immigration laws, leading to more illegal immigration, like the caravan. The author suggests that if laws were enforced, there wouldn't be such a problem.

Next, it discusses campus protests turning violent, with students disrupting speeches. The author points out that these students often face no consequences because universities don't call the police, leading to more disruptions. If they were punished, there might be fewer protests.

It also brings up celebrities threatening the president without facing consequences, suggesting that if they were held accountable, such threats would stop.

The article then mentions public figures like Sarah Sanders and others facing disruptions without legal repercussions, questioning why laws aren't enforced against them.

Finally, it ties this to the idea that ignoring laws can lead to anarchy, referencing Immanuel Kant, emphasizing the importance of enforcing laws consistently.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: law enforcement as deterrence, sanctuary cities leading to more illegal immigration, campus protests without consequences, celebrities threatening the president without repercussions, and the importance of consistent law enforcement to prevent anarchy.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with the caravan, then the examples of law enforcement issues, and conclude with the necessity of deterrence.

The article discusses the importance of law enforcement as a deterrent to maintain social order. It highlights how the fear of punishment, rather than moral character, often compels compliance with laws. Using examples like the caravan of Central Americans migrating illegally to the U.S., the article argues that lax enforcement of immigration laws in sanctuary cities emboldens such movements. Similarly, campus protests often escalate without consequences, suggesting that accountability for disrupters could reduce such incidents. The piece also critiques celebrities making threats against the president without facing repercussions, arguing that stricter enforcement would curb such behavior. It questions why public figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders face disruptions without legal action, suggesting a double standard in law enforcement. The article concludes that ignoring laws can lead to anarchy, emphasizing the need for consistent enforcement to uphold societal stability. 

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the role of law enforcement as a deterrent, arguing that fear of punishment, not morality, drives compliance. It discusses how sanctuary cities and lax immigration enforcement encourage illegal migration, like the Central American caravan. Campus protests and celebrity threats against the president without consequences highlight a lack of accountability. The piece questions why public figures face disruptions without legal action and warns that ignoring laws can lead to anarchy, stressing the need for consistent enforcement to maintain order. END OF SUMMARY.
