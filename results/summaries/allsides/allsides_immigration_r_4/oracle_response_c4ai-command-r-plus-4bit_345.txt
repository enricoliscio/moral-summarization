SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and legality. The fear of punishment is often a stronger motivator for compliance than individual character. Deterrence, or the consistent enforcement of laws, is necessary to prevent widespread lawbreaking. Unpunished disruptions of speeches and violent campus protests set a dangerous precedent and weaken the rule of law. Similarly, celebrities who fantasize about harming the president and protesters who harass conservative politicians without consequences contribute to a culture of lawlessness. The presence of millions of undocumented immigrants in the US and the current caravan of Central American migrants heading to the US-Mexico border are further examples of the breakdown of enforcement. Selective enforcement of laws, such as in sanctuary cities, can lead to a slippery slope where other laws are ignored or nullified. The solution lies in consistent enforcement and the recognition that without force, anarchy and lawlessness prevail.
