SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and deterring unlawful behavior. The presence of laws without enforcement sends a message that they can be ignored, leading to a breakdown of societal order. Campus protests and violent disruptions often go unpunished, encouraging further illegal behavior. Similarly, celebrities who threaten the president and protesters who target conservative figures assume they are above the law due to their status or moral justification. The selective enforcement of laws creates a slippery slope, as it can lead to the justification of unlawful behavior in other areas, such as immigration, abortion, and gun registration. The current legal laxity undermines the very foundation of civilization and must be addressed to restore deterrence and maintain social order.
