SUMMARY:
The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement and deterrence in maintaining a civilized society. Without consequences, individuals are more likely to break the law, leading to a breakdown in legality and an increase in lawlessness. The author argues that ignoring laws, such as those related to immigration and peaceful assembly, can have far-reaching consequences, including the encouragement of violent protests and the undermining of the rule of law. The article also critiques the notion that certain individuals, such as celebrities and politicians, are above the law and can act with impunity. Ultimately, the author contends that without the enforcement of laws, freedom and civilization are threatened, and anarchy can ensue. END OF SUMMARY.
