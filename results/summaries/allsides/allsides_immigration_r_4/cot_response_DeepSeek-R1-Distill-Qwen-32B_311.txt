Okay, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task has two main steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Starting with the first step, I need to read through the article carefully. The user wants each morally framed word listed under "STEP 1:" with each word on a new line prefixed by an asterisk. I should look for words that carry moral connotations, such as 'obey', 'punishment', 'illegal', 'disrupt', etc. I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph to pick out these words.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into under 200 words. The summary must include as many of the identified moral terms as possible. I'll need to capture the main points: the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization, examples like sanctuary cities, campus protests, celebrity threats, and political disruptions. I should ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the moral framing the author intended.

I also need to remember to format the response correctly, starting with "STEP 1:" followed by the list of words, then "SUMMARY:" and the concise summary, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I must avoid markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Let me make sure I don't miss any key points and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral arguments about the necessity of law enforcement and deterrence.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, rather than moral character, often ensures compliance with laws. The author highlights examples such as sanctuary cities, which weaken immigration laws and embolden illegal immigration, like the caravan of Central Americans. Similarly, campus protests, where disrupters face no consequences, encourage more violence. Celebrities who threaten the president without facing repercussions normalize such behavior. The article also notes that political figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders face disruptions without legal consequences, highlighting a double standard. The author warns that ignoring laws can lead to chaos, as seen in the example of sanctuary cities potentially inspiring conservative countermeasures. Kant’s idea that law and freedom require enforcement is invoked to stress the need for consistent legal deterrence to uphold societal order. END OF SUMMARY.
