Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article with specific morally charged words that need to be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and legality. The author uses examples like migrant caravans, campus protests, celebrity threats, and political disruptions to argue that when laws are not enforced, it leads to chaos and undermines the rule of law.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the specified moral words as possible without making it too long. I'll start by identifying key themes: enforcement, deterrence, consequences, and the breakdown of law leading to anarchy.

Next, I'll structure the summary to cover each example briefly. I'll mention the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats, and political disruptions, using the relevant moral terms. I'll also include the author's point about the contagious nature of ignoring laws and the potential for anarchy without enforcement.

I'll keep each section concise, ensuring the summary flows logically and stays within 200 words. I'll check that all important moral terms are included, like enforcement, civilization, legality, obey, comply, unpunished, greenlights, etc.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it accurately reflects the article's moral arguments and that it's clear and coherent.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and legality. It argues that fear of punishment, not just moral character, ensures compliance with laws. The author highlights the consequences of failing to enforce laws, such as the rise of migrant caravans, violent campus protests, and unchecked threats against public figures. Sanctuary cities and the presence of undocumented immigrants signal that laws can be ignored, weakening deterrence. The article warns that ignoring laws is contagious, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or selective enforcement of other statutes. It also critiques the idea that high-profile individuals, like celebrities or politicians, are exempt from legal consequences due to their influence. The author underscores that without enforcement, even the most noble principles, like the Bill of Rights, lose meaning. The moral framework underscores the need for uniform law enforcement to prevent anarchy and maintain social order. END OF SUMMARY.
