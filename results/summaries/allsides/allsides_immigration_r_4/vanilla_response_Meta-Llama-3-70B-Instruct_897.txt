SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that ignoring laws can have far-reaching consequences. It cites examples of how the lack of enforcement has led to chaos, such as the migrant caravan heading to the US, violent campus protests, and celebrities making threats against the president without consequences. The article suggests that if laws were enforced, and individuals were held accountable, such incidents would decrease. It also notes that the current legal laxity is contagious and can boomerang, leading to a breakdown in society. The article concludes that without the rule of law, freedom and democracy are meaningless, and that a strong legal system is necessary to maintain order and protect citizens.
