SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and deterring illegal behavior. The lack of consequences for breaking the law can lead to a breakdown of social order and encourage further lawlessness. Campus protests that disrupt speeches and the growing number of "sanctuary cities" that do not enforce immigration laws are examples of this. Threats of violence against public figures, such as the President, and the harassment of conservative politicians and staffers in public spaces go unchecked, creating a double standard and further eroding the rule of law. The belief that unlawful means can be justified by noble ends is dangerous and can lead to a slippery slope of moral relativism. As Immanuel Kant observed, without law enforcement, our notions of rights and freedoms are meaningless. We must uphold the rule of law consistently and impartially to prevent anarchy and maintain a just society.
