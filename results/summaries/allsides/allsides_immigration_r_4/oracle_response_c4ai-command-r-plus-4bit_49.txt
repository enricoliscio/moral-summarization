SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and legality. The fear of punishment is often a stronger motivator for compliance than individual character. Deterrence, or the consistent enforcement of laws, is necessary to prevent widespread disregard for the law, as exemplified by the current situation with immigration and sanctuary cities. Campus protests that disrupt speeches and turn violent often go unpunished, fostering a culture of lawlessness. Similarly, celebrities who make threats against the President without consequences contribute to an atmosphere of impunity. The selective enforcement of laws, such as the harassment of conservative politicians in public, undermines the very concept of legality. The disregard for law can spread and lead to anarchy, as Immanuel Kant warned. The strength of our legal system and the Bill of Rights relies on consistent enforcement and consequences for those who break the law.
