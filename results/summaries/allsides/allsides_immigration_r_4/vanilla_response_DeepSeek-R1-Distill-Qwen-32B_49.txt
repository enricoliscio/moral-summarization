Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand everything correctly. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and provide a concise summary of the provided article. The summary needs to be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I'll look at the article. It's about the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order. It uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats, and sanctuary cities to illustrate how lack of enforcement can lead to lawlessness. The key points seem to be deterrence, the consequences of ignoring laws, and the impact on society when laws aren't enforced uniformly.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main arguments without getting bogged down in details. I should mention the examples briefly and highlight the central theme that without enforcement, laws lose their effectiveness. Also, the article suggests that ignoring laws can set a bad precedent, leading to more issues down the line.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the main idea, then touch on each example, and conclude with the consequences of lax enforcement. Keeping it concise is crucial, so I'll aim for each sentence to cover one main point without unnecessary details.

Let me start drafting: The article discusses how consistent law enforcement is crucial for maintaining societal order. It uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats, and sanctuary cities to show that ignoring laws can lead to widespread lawlessness. Without deterrence, people are less likely to comply, leading to more violations. The author argues that selective enforcement weakens the rule of law and can create a cycle of chaos, emphasizing that laws must be uniformly enforced to maintain civilization.

Wait, that's a bit long. I need to make it shorter. Maybe combine some points: The article highlights the importance of law enforcement in maintaining order, using examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, and sanctuary cities. It argues that without consistent deterrence, laws lose their effectiveness, leading to widespread lawlessness and societal decay. The author warns that selective enforcement weakens the rule of law, as ignoring one law can encourage others to be disregarded, ultimately threatening civilization.

That's better. It's under 200 words and covers the main points. I think this should meet the user's requirements.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order. It argues that fear of punishment, not just good character, ensures compliance with laws. Using examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, and sanctuary cities, it highlights how lax enforcement weakens the rule of law. When laws are ignored, it sends a message that others can also disregard them, leading to chaos. The author warns that selective enforcement, such as protecting undocumented immigrants or tolerating violent protests, undermines the legal system and encourages further violations. Without consistent deterrence, society risks descending into anarchy, where high-minded ideals mean little without enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
