SUMMARY:
The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that the lack of deterrence has led to the current caravan of thousands of Central Americans attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. It highlights how ignoring laws can have far-reaching consequences, such as the erosion of immigration laws and the emboldening of violent protesters. The author notes that the assumption of impunity among celebrities, students, and politicians has led to a culture of lawlessness, where individuals feel justified in ignoring laws to achieve their goals. The article concludes that without the fear of punishment, society will descend into anarchy, and that the rule of law must be upheld to maintain freedom and order. END OF SUMMARY.
