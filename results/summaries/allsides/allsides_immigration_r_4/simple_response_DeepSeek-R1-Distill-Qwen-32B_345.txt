Okay, so I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about a migrant caravan in Mexico and then shifts to discussing the importance of law enforcement. It argues that people obey laws not because they're inherently good but because they fear punishment. The author uses the example of George Savile's quote about hanging for stealing horses to illustrate deterrence.

Then, the article brings up sanctuary cities and the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., suggesting that not enforcing immigration laws weakens the rule of law and leads to more illegal actions, like the caravan. It also mentions campus protests turning violent, with students disrupting speeches without facing consequences, which the author thinks would decrease if there were stricter enforcement.

The piece also touches on celebrities threatening the president without facing repercussions, arguing that if they were held accountable, such behavior would stop. It points out that influential people, like conservative politicians, are being targeted without legal consequences, which could set a bad precedent. The author criticizes the idea that high-minded goals justify breaking the law, using examples like blocking Supreme Court nominations or helping undocumented immigrants. The conclusion is that ignoring laws can lead to anarchy and that enforcement is crucial for maintaining order.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral points intact. The key themes are the necessity of law enforcement for deterrence, the consequences of not enforcing laws, and how this affects society's moral fabric. I should make sure to include examples like the caravan, campus protests, celebrities, and the potential for anarchy if laws aren't upheld.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the main argument about deterrence, then mention the examples, and conclude with the implications of ignoring laws. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from one point to the next.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement as a cornerstone of civilization, arguing that fear of punishment, not moral character, primarily ensures compliance. It uses examples like sanctuary cities, undocumented immigration, and campus protests to illustrate how lax enforcement weakens the rule of law, enabling illegal actions like the Central American caravan. The author warns that ignoring laws, even for high-minded goals, sets a dangerous precedent, citing celebrities threatening the president and influential figures facing disruptions without consequences. This legal laxity, they argue, risks anarchy, as it signals that laws can be selectively ignored. Without consistent enforcement, society risks losing the deterrence needed to maintain order and uphold the Bill of Rights. END OF SUMMARY.
