SUMMARY: Law enforcement is crucial for maintaining civilization and deterring unlawful behavior. The presence of laws without enforcement sends a message that they can be ignored, leading to a breakdown of social order. Campus protests that disrupt speeches and turn violent often go unpunished, encouraging further unlawful behavior. Similarly, celebrities who make threats against the President face no consequences, normalizing such behavior. The laxity in law enforcement has led to a sense of impunity among certain groups, with conservative figures facing harassment and intimidation without legal repercussions. The selective enforcement of laws based on moral justifications sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the very concept of legality. As Immanuel Kant observed, without force to back them up, laws and freedoms are meaningless. The current situation underscores the importance of consistent and impartial law enforcement to deter unlawful behavior and maintain social order.
