Okay, so I'm trying to summarize this article that's about the importance of law enforcement and how the lack of it can lead to various societal issues. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They provided a list of morally framed words, so I need to make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It talks about how law enforcement isn't just about punishing individuals but also about maintaining civilization and legality. The author uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats, and sanctuary cities to show that when laws aren't enforced, it sends a message that laws can be ignored, leading to more violations.

I need to highlight the key moral concepts: enforcement, legality, obeying laws, consequences, deterrence, etc. The summary should mention how the lack of enforcement in one area can weaken other laws, leading to a breakdown in society. I should also include the examples given, like the caravan, protests, celebrities, and sanctuary cities, to illustrate the points.

I'll structure the summary to start with the main idea about law enforcement being crucial for civilization, then touch on each example, emphasizing the moral implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to use as many of the provided moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me outline the points:
1. Law enforcement maintains civilization and legality.
2. Examples of law laxity: migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats.
3. Consequences of ignoring laws: weakened legal system, deterrence lost.
4. The moral implications of selective enforcement and its impact on society.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral words and examples, keeping it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and legality, arguing that fear of punishment, not just moral character, drives citizens to obey laws. It highlights how unpunished violations, such as those in "sanctuary cities" or the migrant caravan, weaken the rule of law and greenlight further illegal actions. Campus protests and celebrity threats against the president illustrate how ignoring legal consequences can normalize unlawful behavior. The author warns that legal laxity, justified by high-minded moral concerns, risks creating anarchy, where laws are selectively enforced or ignored. Without consistent enforcement, society risks losing deterrence, leading to chaos. The article underscores that without the force of law, even the Bill of Rights becomes meaningless. END OF SUMMARY.
