SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and deterring illegal behavior. It argues that the fear of punishment is often a stronger motivator for compliance with laws than an individual's moral character. The presence of millions of undocumented immigrants in the US and the lack of enforcement of immigration laws have weakened the concept of deterrence, leading to the formation of a migrant caravan heading towards the US-Mexico border. Similarly, the lack of consequences for disruptive campus protests and celebrity threats against the President encourage more unlawful behavior. The article warns that ignoring laws can have unintended consequences and suggests that enforcing laws fairly and consistently is essential for maintaining social order and preventing anarchy. 

END OF SUMMARY.
