Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by talking about a migrant caravan in Mexico and then shifts to the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order. It mentions that people obey laws not just because they're good, but because they fear punishment. It uses the example of George Savile's quote about stealing horses to illustrate deterrence.

Then it discusses modern examples like sanctuary cities and the presence of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., suggesting that lack of enforcement leads to more lawlessness. It also touches on campus protests turning violent, with students not facing consequences, which emboldens more disruptions. The article brings up celebrities threatening the president without repercussions, implying that if they were held accountable, such behavior would stop.

It also mentions public figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders facing disruptions without legal consequences, which could set a bad precedent. The author argues that ignoring laws can spread and cause unintended consequences, like conservative sanctuary zones or exempting other groups from laws. Finally, it quotes Immanuel Kant about the necessity of enforcement for rights to matter.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the importance of law enforcement, examples of lack of deterrence leading to more issues, and the potential consequences of ignoring laws. I'll make sure to mention the migrant caravan, sanctuary cities, campus protests, celebrity threats, and the philosophical point about enforcement.

Let me structure it: Start with the caravan, then the argument about deterrence, examples of sanctuary cities and undocumented immigrants, campus protests and consequences, celebrities and threats, public figures facing disruptions, the contagious nature of ignoring laws, and the Kant quote. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, rather than morality, often ensures compliance with laws. Examples include sanctuary cities and undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which weaken immigration laws and encourage illegal activities like the migrant caravan. Campus protests, where students disrupt events without facing consequences, highlight the lack of deterrence. Celebrities threatening the president without repercussions further erode respect for the law. Public figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders face disruptions, setting a precedent for others. The article warns that ignoring laws can spread, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or exempting other groups. It concludes that without enforcement, rights and freedoms lose meaning, as emphasized by Immanuel Kant's view on law and force. END OF SUMMARY.
