SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and that ignoring laws can have far-reaching consequences. It cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against the President, where a lack of consequences for illegal actions has led to a culture of impunity. The author suggests that if laws are not enforced, it can lead to a breakdown of society and create a sense of anarchy. The article also notes that the current legal laxity is contagious and can boomerang, with sanctuary cities potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones, and disruptions of public figures potentially becoming a norm. The author concludes that without law enforcement, the Bill of Rights means nothing, and that a culture of deterrence is necessary to maintain order and civility.

END OF SUMMARY.
