SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining a civilized society and deterring illegal behavior through the fear of punishment. It argues that the lack of enforcement of certain laws, such as immigration laws and laws regarding peaceful assembly, can have far-reaching consequences and lead to a breakdown of law and order. The article gives examples of campus protests, celebrity threats against the president, and disruptions faced by conservative public figures to illustrate the double standard in law enforcement and the potential for contagion if laws are selectively ignored. It suggests that the current caravan of Central American migrants heading to the US-Mexico border is a result of the perception that US immigration laws can be ignored without consequences. The article concludes with a quote from German philosopher Immanuel Kant, emphasizing the importance of force in maintaining law and freedom.
