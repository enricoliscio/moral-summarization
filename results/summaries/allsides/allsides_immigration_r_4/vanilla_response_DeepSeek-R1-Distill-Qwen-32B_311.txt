Okay, I need to summarize this article about law enforcement and its importance in maintaining societal order. The article starts with a migrant caravan in Mexico and then discusses how law enforcement deters violations, using George Savile's quote about hanging for stealing horses. It mentions that fear of punishment, not just good character, makes people obey laws.

Next, it talks about sanctuary cities in the U.S. and how ignoring immigration laws can lead to more lawlessness, like the caravan of Central Americans. The article also brings up campus protests turning violent, with students disrupting speeches without facing consequences, which emboldens more protests.

Celebrities threatening the president without facing repercussions is another point, suggesting that if they were held accountable, such behavior would stop. It also mentions public figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders facing disruptions without legal consequences.

The article argues that ignoring laws leads to a contagious effect, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or other groups exempting themselves from laws. It concludes with Kant's idea that without enforcement, rights mean nothing.

I need to condense all these points into a coherent summary under 200 words, highlighting the main ideas about deterrence, the consequences of lax enforcement, and the broader societal implications.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, rather than moral character, often ensures compliance with laws. The presence of sanctuary cities and unchecked illegal immigration in the U.S. weakens the rule of law, potentially encouraging more violations, such as the migrant caravan heading north. Similarly, campus protests often turn violent, with students rarely facing consequences, emboldening further disruptions. Celebrities threatening the president without repercussions highlight how ignoring laws can set a dangerous precedent. Public figures like Sarah Huckabee Sanders face disruptions without legal consequences, suggesting a double standard. The article warns that ignoring laws is contagious, potentially leading to conservative sanctuary zones or other groups exempting themselves from legal obligations. It concludes that without enforcement, rights and freedoms lose meaning. END OF SUMMARY.
