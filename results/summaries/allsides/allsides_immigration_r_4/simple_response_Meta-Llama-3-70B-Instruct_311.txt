SUMMARY:

The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintaining civilization and that the lack of consequences for illegal actions is leading to a breakdown in society. The author cites examples such as the migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrities making threats against the president, all of which are emboldened by the lack of punishment. The author contends that when laws are not enforced, it creates a culture of impunity and undermines the rule of law. The article also notes that this lack of enforcement can have unintended consequences, such as the creation of "conservative sanctuary zones" and the disruption of public figures from all political backgrounds. The author concludes that without the fear of punishment, citizens will not comply with laws, and that a strong legal system is necessary to maintain order and protect individual freedoms.
