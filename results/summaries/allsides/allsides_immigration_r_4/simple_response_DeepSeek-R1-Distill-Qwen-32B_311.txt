Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about law enforcement and its role in maintaining civilization. It mentions that people obey laws not just because they're good but because they fear punishment. The author uses examples like the migrant caravan, campus protests, celebrity threats against Trump, and sanctuary cities to illustrate the idea that when laws aren't enforced, it leads to a breakdown of order.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral argument: that consistent law enforcement is essential to prevent anarchy and ensure everyone follows the rules. The examples should show how lax enforcement leads to bigger issues. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I should structure it by introducing the main idea, then briefly mention each example, and conclude with the importance of enforcement. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes the importance of law enforcement in maintaining societal order and deterrence. It argues that fear of punishment, not just moral character, drives compliance with laws. The author uses examples like the Central American migrant caravan, campus protests, and celebrity threats against President Trump to illustrate how lax enforcement weakens the rule of law. Sanctuary cities and the presence of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. are seen as signaling that laws can be ignored, leading to a breakdown of deterrence. The article warns that ignoring laws is contagious and can boomerang, potentially justifying exemptions for other groups or causes. It concludes that without consistent law enforcement, civilization risks descending into anarchy, where high-minded principles mean little without the enforcement of laws. END OF SUMMARY.
