SUMMARY:
The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without deterrence, individuals may feel unpunished and above the law, leading to a breakdown in social order. The current caravan of migrants and violent campus protests are symptoms of a larger problem - a lack of consequence for illegal actions. Celebrities who fantasize about harming the president and politicians who are disrupted in public are not held accountable, perpetuating a culture of laxity. This moral laxity is contagious and can boomerang, leading to anarchy and a loss of freedom. The article concludes that without the cop on the beat and the local district attorney, our high-minded talk about the Bill of Rights means nothing. END OF SUMMARY.
