END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: Law enforcement is essential for maintaining civilization and legality. Fear of punishment and shame are often more effective than individual character in ensuring obedience to the law. Campus protests that disrupt speeches and assemblies often go unpunished, sending a message that such actions carry no consequences. Similarly, the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. without legal repercussions weakens the credibility of immigration laws and other legislation. The current caravan of Central American migrants heading towards the U.S. is a result of this perceived lack of enforcement. Violent campus protests and threats of harm against the President by celebrities and protesters also reflect a breakdown of law and order. The freedom to eat, work, and relax without fear of disturbance or violence is being infringed upon, particularly for those deemed politically conservative. The selective enforcement of laws and the justification of unlawful means for moral ends contribute to a culture of impunity and anarchy.
