SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of law enforcement in maintaining civilization and legality. It argues that fear of punishment, such as the shame of arrest, fines, or imprisonment, is often a more effective deterrent against illegal behavior than an individual's character. Law enforcement serves as a reminder to society that legality is necessary for civilization to function. The author cites the example of one protester disrupting a speech, and how allowing such an action to go unpunished can encourage similar incidents in the future. This extends to immigration laws, where the presence of millions of foreign nationals living unlawfully in the US without consequence sends a message that US immigration law can be ignored. Campus protests that turn violent, celebrity threats against the president, and public disruptions targeting conservative figures all contribute to a sense of legal laxity. The article suggests that ignoring laws can have unintended consequences and may lead to a breakdown of law and order. The actions of sanctuary cities and the current migrant caravan further highlight the importance of enforcing immigration laws and securing borders. Ultimately, the author emphasizes that maintaining law and order requires both the "cop on the beat" and a respect for higher moral concerns, such as the Bill of Rights. END OF SUMMARY.
