SUMMARY: Law enforcement is essential for maintaining a civilized society, as it serves to deter potential violators and remind everyone that legality is necessary for civilization to function. The recent migrant caravan and campus protests illustrate the consequences of lax law enforcement, where unpunished violators encourage more illegal behavior. The presence of millions of undocumented immigrants in the US and the lack of consequences for violent campus protests send a message that laws can be ignored. This selective enforcement of laws is dangerous and contagious, as it can lead to a breakdown of order and the justification of unlawful means for supposed moral ends. Even the wealthy and famous are not immune, with some celebrities fantasizing about harming President Trump without consequence. The freedom to live without fear of violence or disturbance is at stake, and the current legal laxity threatens the very foundation of our society. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant underscores the importance of force in upholding law and freedom.
