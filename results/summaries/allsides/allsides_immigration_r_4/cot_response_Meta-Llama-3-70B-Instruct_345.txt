SUMMARY:
The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and deter individuals from violating the law. Without fear of punishment, individuals are more likely to break the law, leading to a breakdown in society. The author cites examples of protesters disrupting speeches, celebrities making threats against the president, and politicians being harassed in public, all without facing consequences. This lack of enforcement creates a culture of impunity, where individuals feel they can ignore the law without fear of reprisal. The article warns that this "legal laxity" can have far-reaching consequences, leading to anarchy and a breakdown in the rule of law. The author concludes that without a strong enforcement of laws, society will descend into chaos. END OF SUMMARY.
