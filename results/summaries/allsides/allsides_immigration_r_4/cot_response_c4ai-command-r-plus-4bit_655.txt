SUMMARY:
Law enforcement is essential for maintaining civilization and legality. The fear of punishment, such as the shame of arrest, fines, or imprisonment, often deters people from breaking the law. When laws are left unenforced, it weakens the entire legal system and undermines deterrence. This is evident in the current migrant caravan, where a lack of secure borders and immigration enforcement has led to thousands of people attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. Similarly, campus protests that disrupt speeches and turn violent often go unpunished, encouraging more illegal behavior. Celebrities who threaten the president and protesters who harass conservative politicians assume they are above the law due to their fame or moral justifications. However, ignoring laws is contagious and can lead to a breakdown of order, with some jurisdictions even declaring themselves sanctuary cities or zones. The article concludes with a quote from German philosopher Immanuel Kant, emphasizing that without enforcement, our high-minded ideals about rights and freedoms are meaningless.
