The article argues that law enforcement is essential to maintain civilization and legality. Without consequences, individuals are more likely to disobey laws, leading to a breakdown in society. The author cites examples of unpunished protesters, illegal immigrants, and celebrities who fantasize about harming the president, all of whom assume they are above the law. This lack of enforcement and consequence creates an atmosphere of illegality, where laws are ignored and violence is tolerated. The author warns that if laws are not enforced, it can lead to anarchy and a loss of freedom. The article concludes that without a strong system of law enforcement, society will descend into chaos and disorder.
