SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination for the 2020 election. Amash, a former Republican who left the GOP last summer, has been toying with the idea of a third-party campaign for months and has centered his political career around libertarian values. He has gained a national profile for his vocal attacks on the White House and his support for impeachment. Amash would be the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 race, and it is unclear if he would draw more support away from Trump or Biden. Libertarians see Amash as a potential game-changer for the party, appealing to both Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans. Amash has advocated for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending to offset the deficit. His announcement comes amid a handful of Republican challengers in his House reelection campaign and visceral rebukes from the GOP.
END OF SUMMARY.
