Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. They provided the article, so I need to read through it and extract the key points.

First, I notice that Amash is a former Republican congressman from Michigan. He's launching an exploratory committee, which is a significant step towards a third-party run. The article mentions his frustration with the Republican party, especially under Trump, and his shift towards Libertarian values.

I should highlight his reasons for running: he wants a president who respects the Constitution and unites people. Also, his focus on less government intervention and reducing federal spending is important. 

The article also talks about the potential impact of his candidacy. He might attract both Libertarians and Never Trump Republicans. There's some uncertainty about whether he'll draw votes away from Trump or Biden, but it's noted that Trump has a strong hold on the GOP, so Amash could appeal to disenchanted Republicans.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start with the announcement, his background, his reasons for running, his political stance, and the potential impact on the election. Make sure to mention his departure from the GOP and his support for impeachment, which shows his shift in political alignment.

I should avoid getting too deep into the quotes but include the main points. Also, note that while he's a strong candidate, it's unclear how much he'll affect the race. 

Putting it all together, I'll structure it to flow from his announcement, his motivations, his political platform, and the implications for the election. Keep each sentence clear and to the point to stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a former Republican congressman, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, signaling his intent to run as a third-party candidate. Amash, who has long advocated for libertarian values like limited government and fiscal conservatism, criticized the Republican Party for abandoning these principles under President Trump. He left the GOP last year and supported Democrats in their impeachment effort. Amash’s potential candidacy could attract disenchanted Republicans and Libertarians, positioning him as a viable third-party option in the 2020 election. His campaign aims to restore constitutional respect and unite Americans, though it remains unclear whether his bid would impact votes for Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
