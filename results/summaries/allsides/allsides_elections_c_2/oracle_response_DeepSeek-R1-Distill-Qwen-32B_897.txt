Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words to include are: protests, restore, bring, serving, exploding, misbehavior, excusing, defenses, assault.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Justin Amash is launching an exploratory committee for the Libertarian nomination, aiming to offer a third-party alternative. He emphasizes restoring respect for the Constitution and bringing people together. The article mentions his criticism of Trump and the potential impact on the election.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words. Let me note where each word fits. "Protests" are mentioned in the context of state capitols, so that's relevant. "Restore" and "bring" are part of his campaign message. "Exploding" refers to the deficit, which is a key point in his platform. "Misbehavior" and "excusing" relate to his criticism of Trump and the GOP. "Defenses" and "assault" might fit in the context of his attacks on the administration.

I'll structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with Amash launching the committee, mention the protests, his goals to restore and bring unity. Highlight his focus on exploding deficit and government intervention. Then discuss his criticism of Trump's misbehavior and the GOP's defenses. Finally, address the potential impact on the election, noting the assault on the media and the choice between Trump and Biden.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included without forcing them in. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll present it as the summary.

SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, signaling his intent to run as a third-party candidate. Amash emphasizes his commitment to restoring respect for the Constitution and bringing people together, while advocating for practical approaches rooted in humility and trust. His campaign focuses on reducing government intervention and addressing the exploding federal deficit. Amash, a former Republican, has criticized President Trump for misbehavior and excusing his actions, which he argues tarnishes the GOP’s reputation. His potential candidacy could draw support from Never Trump Republicans and Libertarians, offering a third-party alternative to Trump or Biden. Amash’s criticism of Trump has sparked backlash from the GOP, but he remains a prominent figure in the Libertarian movement. His bid could influence the election by appealing to those disenchanted with both major parties, potentially impacting the race through a third-party assault on the status quo. END OF SUMMARY.
