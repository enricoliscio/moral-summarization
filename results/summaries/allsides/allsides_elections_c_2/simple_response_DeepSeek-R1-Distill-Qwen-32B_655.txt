Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian presidential nomination. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Amash, a former Republican, is considering a third-party run. He's focusing on Libertarian values like limited government and fiscal responsibility. He's criticizing Trump and has been a vocal opponent, even supporting impeachment. His move could potentially draw votes away from Trump or Biden, affecting the election dynamics.

I need to highlight the moral aspects here. The article talks about Amash's belief in practical approaches, respect for the Constitution, and uniting people. His decision to leave the GOP because they abandoned fiscal conservatism is a key moral point. Also, the potential impact on the election by taking votes from either side is another moral consideration regarding the integrity of the democratic process.

I should structure the summary to include his announcement, his values, his criticism of Trump, his departure from the GOP, and the implications for the election. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while capturing these elements is crucial.

I should avoid technical jargon and make sure the summary flows logically, starting with his announcement, then his values, his past actions, and ending with the potential effects on the election. I also need to mention that his candidacy might influence voters who are dissatisfied with Trump or Biden.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.
