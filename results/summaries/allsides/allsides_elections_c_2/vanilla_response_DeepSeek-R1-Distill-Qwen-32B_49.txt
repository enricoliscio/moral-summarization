Alright, I need to summarize this article about Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian presidential nomination. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination. He's a former Republican from Michigan who has been considering a third-party run for months. His tweets emphasize humility, trust in people, and restoring constitutional respect. 

He's been pressured by Libertarians to run, and experts think he could attract both Libertarians and Never Trump Republicans. His platform includes less government intervention and spending cuts. Amash left the GOP last summer, criticizing them for abandoning fiscal conservatism and defending Trump's misbehavior. His support for impeachment made him a target for GOP criticism.

Now, he's positioning himself as a third-party option, which could draw votes away from Trump or Biden. The article mentions that Trump has the Republican base, so any Republican not voting for Trump might support Biden, but Amash could be an attractive alternative.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on key points: Amash's announcement, his reasons, Libertarian support, his platform, his split from GOP, and the potential impact on the election.

Let me structure it step by step, making sure to include all important elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, signaling his potential third-party bid for the White House. Amash, a former Republican from Michigan, has long advocated for libertarian values, including reduced government intervention and lower federal spending. His decision to explore a presidential run has been influenced by pressure from Libertarians and his growing national profile, particularly after his vocal criticism of President Trump and support for impeachment. Amash, who left the GOP last year, aims to appeal to both Libertarians and disenchanted Republicans, positioning himself as an alternative to Trump and Biden. His candidacy could draw votes from both parties, potentially impacting the 2020 election. END OF SUMMARY.
