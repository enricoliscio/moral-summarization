SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been considering a third-party campaign and has received pressure from Libertarians to run. He has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. Amash has been vocal in his criticism of President Trump, which has earned him rebukes from the GOP. If he wins the Libertarian nomination, he would be the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 election. It is unclear whether Amash's candidacy would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

END OF SUMMARY.
