SUMMARY: 
Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating he may mount a third-party bid for the White House. Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, has built his political career on libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. He has gained a national profile for his vocal attacks on the White House and his support for impeachment, which drew visceral rebukes from the GOP. Amash left the GOP, citing their abandonment of fiscal conservatism and their excusing of the president's misbehavior, which he believes will tarnish their name in history. He would be the most prominent third-party contender this cycle, and it is unclear if he would draw more support from Trump or Biden voters. Amash stated that he is honored and excited to take the first steps toward serving Americans of every background as president, bringing people together with humility and trust and restoring respect for the Constitution.
