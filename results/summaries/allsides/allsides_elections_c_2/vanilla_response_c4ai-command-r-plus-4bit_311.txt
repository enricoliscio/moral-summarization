SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination for the 2020 election. Amash, who left the GOP last year, has gained prominence for his vocal criticism of President Trump and his support for the House's impeachment resolution. Amash's potential third-party bid has sparked interest among Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans, who see him as a viable candidate to challenge the two-party system. Advocates for Amash argue that he could appeal to a wide range of voters, from Libertarians to disaffected Republicans and even some Democrats. However, it remains unclear whether an Amash candidacy would draw more support away from Trump or the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. Amash has built his political career on libertarian values, advocating for limited government and fiscal conservatism. His entry into the race would make him the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 presidential election.
END OF SUMMARY.
