Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian presidential nomination. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Amash is a former Republican congressman who's now exploring a third-party bid. He's been under pressure from Libertarians to run. His platform includes less government intervention and reducing federal spending. He's been critical of Trump, even supporting impeachment, which caused him to leave the GOP. Now, he's positioning himself as a unifying figure who respects the Constitution. The article also discusses how his candidacy might affect the election, possibly taking votes from either Trump or Biden.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Amash is seen as a potential savior for those disenchanted with both major parties. His values of limited government and unity are key. The moral framing is about offering a viable alternative to the current political divide, aiming to restore constitutional respect and bring people together.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes the main points with the moral perspective emphasized.
