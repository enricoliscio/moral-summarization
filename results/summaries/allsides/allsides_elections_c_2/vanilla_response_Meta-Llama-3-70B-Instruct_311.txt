SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been considering a third-party campaign for months and has come under pressure from Libertarians to run. He has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. Amash's national profile has soared with his vocal attacks against the Trump administration, and he has been critical of Republicans for abandoning fiscal conservatism. If he wins the Libertarian nomination, Amash would be the most prominent third-party contender to run for the White House this cycle. It is unclear if Amash would draw more support away from Trump or Biden, but he could attract Republicans who are tired of the noise and don't agree with Biden on the issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
