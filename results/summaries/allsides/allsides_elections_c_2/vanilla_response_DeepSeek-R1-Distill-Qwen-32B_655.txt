Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian presidential nomination. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. He's a former Republican from Michigan. He tweeted about it, emphasizing practical approaches, humility, trust, and restoring respect for the Constitution. 

He's been considering a third-party run for months and has faced pressure from Libertarians. They think he could attract not just Libertarians but also Never Trump Republicans. His political stance is around less government intervention and cutting federal spending. 

Amash left the GOP last summer, criticizing them for abandoning fiscal conservatism and defending Trump. He supported the impeachment effort, which made him unpopular with Republicans. Now, as a third-party candidate, it's unclear whether he'd draw votes away from Trump or Biden. Some think he might appeal to Republicans tired of the noise who don't agree with Biden.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention his announcement, his background, his political values, his split from the GOP, his potential impact on the election, and the uncertainty about his voter base. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail.
