SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been considering a third-party campaign for months and has come under pressure from Libertarians to run. He has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. Amash has been a vocal critic of President Trump, and his criticism has earned rebukes from the GOP. If he wins the Libertarian nomination, he would be the most prominent third-party contender to run for the White House this cycle. It is unclear if Amash would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

END OF SUMMARY.
