SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, signaling a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican turned Independent, has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending to offset an exploding deficit. He has gained a national profile through his vocal attacks on the White House and his support for the impeachment effort against President Trump. Amash's criticism of the GOP and the president has drawn visceral rebukes from Republicans and has positioned him as a potential attractive third-party option for voters who are dissatisfied with both Trump and Biden. Amash's campaign promises to restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together, serving Americans of every background. His entry into the race raises questions about the impact a third-party candidate could have on the election and which party they would draw more support from.
END OF SUMMARY.
