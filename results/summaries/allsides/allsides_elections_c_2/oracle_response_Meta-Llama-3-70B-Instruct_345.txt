SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, marking a significant step towards a third-party White House bid. Amash's decision comes after months of pressure from Libertarians and his vocal criticism of President Trump's "misbehavior". The former Republican congressman has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending to offset the "exploding" deficit. Amash's criticism of Trump has earned him visceral rebukes from the GOP, but he remains committed to "restoring" respect for the Constitution and "bringing" people together. His potential candidacy has sparked debate over whether he would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. As a third-party contender, Amash offers a unique option for voters tired of the political noise, promising to "serve" Americans of every background with humility and trust.
