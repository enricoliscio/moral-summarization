SUMMARY:
Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, citing a need for "practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people." Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, accusing Republicans of abandoning fiscal conservatism and turning a blind eye to "misbehavior." His decision to run as a third-party candidate is seen as a potential game-changer, as he could attract "Never Trump" Republicans and Libertarians alike. Amash's platform centers on libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. His criticism of Trump has earned him "visceral rebukes" from the GOP, but he remains committed to restoring "respect for our Constitution and bring people together." END OF SUMMARY.
