SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. Amash, who has been a vocal critic of President Trump, believes Americans are ready for a presidency that will restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together. His potential third-party bid has garnered attention from Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans, who see him as a viable alternative. Amash's political career has centered around libertarian values, advocating for limited government intervention and fiscal conservatism. His criticism of Trump has earned him rebukes from the GOP, but he remains committed to his principles. If he wins the Libertarian nomination, it's unclear whether he would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Nevertheless, Amash's entry into the race could shake up the political landscape.

END OF SUMMARY.
