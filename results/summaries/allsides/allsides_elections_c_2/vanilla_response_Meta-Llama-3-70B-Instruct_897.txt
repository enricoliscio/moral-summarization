SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been considering a third-party campaign for months and has come under pressure from Libertarians to run. He has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. Amash has been a vocal critic of President Trump and has seen his national profile soar as a result. If he wins the Libertarian nomination, he would be the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 election. It is unclear whether Amash would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. However, some Republicans see him as an attractive third-party option for those tired of the noise and not aligned with Biden on issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
