Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Justin Amash launching his exploratory committee for the Libertarian presidential nomination. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author used. I remember the author used words like protests, restore, bring, serving, exploding, misbehavior, excusing, defenses, and assault. I need to make sure these words are included if possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, has started an exploratory committee for the Libertarian nomination. He's been considering a third-party run for months and has faced pressure from Libertarians. His platform includes less government intervention and cutting federal spending. He's been critical of Trump, supporting impeachment, and left the GOP because they abandoned fiscal conservatism. There's uncertainty about whether his candidacy would affect Trump or Biden's support.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the morally charged words as possible. I'll start by mentioning his announcement, the purpose of the committee, and his goals. Then, I'll touch on his background, the pressure from Libertarians, his values, and his criticism of Trump. Finally, I'll note the uncertainty about his impact on the election.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the announcement, his motivations, background, and the implications. I'll make sure to include words like "protests," "restore," "bring," "serving," "exploding," "misbehavior," "excusing," "defenses," and "assault" where appropriate.

Let me draft it step by step. First sentence: Amash announced an exploratory committee for the Libertarian nomination, aiming to restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together. Next, mention his background as a former Republican, his focus on libertarian values, and his criticism of Trump. Then, talk about the pressure from Libertarians and the potential impact on the election.

I should ensure the summary is concise and includes all key points without exceeding 200 words. I'll check the word count after drafting to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I need to maintain the moral framing by using those specific words where relevant.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words.
