SUMMARY: 

Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. Amash, who has been vocal in his criticism of President Trump, believes Americans are ready for a presidency that will restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together. His decision to run as a third-party candidate is seen as a significant move, as he could attract support from both Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans. Amash's political career has been centered around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. His criticism of Trump has earned him rebukes from the GOP, but he remains committed to his principles. It is unclear whether Amash's candidacy would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. However, his entry into the race could provide a viable alternative for voters disillusioned with the two-party system.

END OF SUMMARY.
