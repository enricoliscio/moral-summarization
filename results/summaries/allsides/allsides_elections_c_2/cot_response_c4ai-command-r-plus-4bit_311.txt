SUMMARY:
Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, a *strongest indication* that he will mount a third-party White House bid. Amash, who left the Republican Party last year, has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. He has seen his national profile soar with vocal attacks against the White House and support for Democrats' impeachment efforts. Amash's criticism has earned him *visceral rebukes* from the GOP and a handful of Republican *challengers*. Despite this, Amash would be the most *prominent contender* to run as a third-party candidate this cycle. It remains unclear whether his bid would draw more support away from Trump or Biden. Amash expressed his *excitement* and *honor* at taking the first steps toward serving Americans of every background as president.
END OF SUMMARY.
