SUMMARY:

Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, signaling his potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, accusing the GOP of abandoning fiscal conservatism and excusing the president's misbehavior. He has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending to offset the exploding deficit. Amash's criticism has earned him visceral rebukes from the GOP, but he remains committed to restoring respect for the Constitution and bringing people together. His potential candidacy has sparked excitement among Libertarians, who see him as a game-changer for the party. However, it remains unclear whether Amash would draw more support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
