SUMMARY:
Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. Amash, who has been a vocal critic of President Trump, tweeted that Americans are ready for a presidency that will "restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together" with "practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people." His decision to run as a third-party candidate has been met with excitement from Libertarians, who see him as a potential game changer for the party. Amash's political career has centered around libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. His criticism of Trump has earned him visceral rebukes from the GOP, but he remains committed to his principles, saying that "excusing his misbehavior will forever tarnish your name." Amash's candidacy offers an attractive third-party option for voters who are tired of the noise and don't agree with the Democratic nominee on the issues. END OF SUMMARY.
