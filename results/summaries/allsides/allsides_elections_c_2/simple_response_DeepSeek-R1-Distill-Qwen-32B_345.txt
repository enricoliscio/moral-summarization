Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rep. Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Amash is leaving the Republican party and considering a third-party run. He's emphasizing his libertarian values, which include less government intervention and fiscal conservatism. He's critical of Trump and supported impeachment, which has made him a target for Republicans but also a potential draw for some Libertarians and Never Trump Republicans.

I need to highlight his moral stance. He's positioning himself as a unifying figure who respects the Constitution and wants to bring people together. This is a contrast to the current political climate, which he sees as divided. His exploratory committee is a significant step, showing his commitment despite potential challenges.

I should also mention the potential impact on the election, whether it might draw votes away from Trump or Biden. The article suggests that Libertarians see him as a potential game-changer, but it's still uncertain how much support he can gather.

I'll structure the summary to include his announcement, his values, the reasons for his departure from the GOP, his criticism of Trump, and the potential implications for the election. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral framing is clear.

Amash, a former Republican congressman, has long advocated for libertarian values, including less government intervention and fiscal conservatism. He has criticized President Trump, supporting impeachment and accusing Republicans of abandoning their principles. Amash’s potential candidacy is seen as a draw for Libertarians and “Never Trump” Republicans, with some viewing him as a potential game-changer in the 2020 race. His campaign could attract voters disenchanted with both Trump and Biden, though it remains unclear whether he would siphon votes from Trump or the Democratic nominee. Amash positions himself as a unifying figure committed to constitutional principles and practical governance, offering a contrast to the polarized political climate. END OF SUMMARY.
