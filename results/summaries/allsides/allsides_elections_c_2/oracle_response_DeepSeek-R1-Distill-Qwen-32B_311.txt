Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rep. Justin Amash is launching an exploratory committee for the Libertarian nomination, which is a significant move. He's leaving the Republican party, and his stance against Trump is a big part of his image. The article mentions several morally charged words like protests, restore, bring, serving, exploding, misbehavior, excusing, defenses, and assault. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key events: Amash's announcement, his reasons for running as a third-party candidate, his values, and the potential impact on the election. I'll need to mention the protests hitting state capitols as that sets the context. Then, highlight his goal to restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together, using the words "restore" and "bring." 

His focus on less government intervention and cutting federal spending ties into the "exploding" deficit. I should include that to show his stance. The part about him criticizing Trump and the GOP's misbehavior is crucial, so I'll use "misbehavior" and "excusing." Also, the mention of the GOP's defenses against him is important for the moral framing.

Finally, the article discusses the potential impact on the election, whether he'll draw support away from Trump or Biden. I'll need to summarize that without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and include all the morally framed words as much as possible. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, signaling his intent to run as a third-party candidate. Amash, a former Republican congressman, has long advocated for libertarian values, including less government intervention and reduced federal spending to address the exploding deficit. He has criticized President Trump, supporting Democrats in their impeachment effort and accusing Republicans of excusing Trump’s misbehavior. Amash left the GOP last summer, citing its abandonment of fiscal conservatism and complicity in defending Trump’s actions. His potential candidacy could draw support from Never Trump Republicans and Libertarians, potentially impacting the 2020 election. Amash aims to restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together, positioning himself as a unifying figure. His campaign could also serve as an alternative for Republicans disenchanted with Trump, though it remains unclear whether he would siphon votes from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
