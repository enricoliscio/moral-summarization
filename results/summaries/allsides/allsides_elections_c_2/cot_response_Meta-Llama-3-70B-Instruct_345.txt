SUMMARY:
Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, citing a need for "practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people." Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, accusing the GOP of abandoning fiscal conservatism and turning a blind eye to "misbehavior" to appease the president. His criticism has earned him "visceral rebukes" from the GOP. Amash's potential third-party bid could attract "Never Trump" Republicans and Libertarians, who view him as a "prominent" contender. If successful, Amash promises to "restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together." His candidacy could have a significant "impact" on the race, potentially drawing support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
