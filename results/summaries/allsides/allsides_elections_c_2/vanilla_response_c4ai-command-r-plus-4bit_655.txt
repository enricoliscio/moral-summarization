SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination for the 2020 election. Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who left the GOP and became an Independent, has been critical of President Trump and supported Democrats in their impeachment efforts. Amash's potential third-party bid has been encouraged by Libertarians and some "Never Trump" Republicans, who see him as a strong contender to bring their party to relevance in the upcoming election. Amash has centered his political career around libertarian values, advocating for limited government intervention and fiscal conservatism. It remains unclear whether Amash would draw more support away from Trump or Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee. A GOP operative suggested that Amash could provide an attractive third-party option for Republicans who are tired of Trump but do not align with Biden ideologically.
END OF SUMMARY.
