Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Rep. Justin Amash announcing his exploratory committee for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. He's leaving the Republican Party and is considering a third-party bid. 

I should note the key elements: his reasons for leaving the GOP, his focus on Libertarian values like less government intervention, and his criticism of Trump. Also, the potential impact on the election, whether it might take votes from Trump or Biden.

Now, the user wants the summary to maintain the moral framing. That means I should highlight the underlying values and the ethical stance Amash is taking. He's emphasizing constitutional respect, unity, and a return to fiscal conservatism. I need to make sure these points are clear.

I should structure the summary to first mention his announcement, then his reasons for leaving the Republicans, his values, and the potential effects on the election. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the specified tokens and keep the language clear and straightforward. I should avoid any markdown and stick to plain text as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination, signaling his intent to run as a third-party candidate. Amash, a former Republican, has long advocated for libertarian principles, including reduced government intervention and fiscal conservatism. His decision to leave the GOP last year was driven by dissatisfaction with the party’s support for President Trump, whom he criticized for misbehavior and for abandoning conservative principles. Amash’s potential candidacy is seen as a viable third-party option, particularly for disaffected Republicans and libertarians. His campaign could draw support away from Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden, depending on how voters perceive his appeal. Amash emphasizes his commitment to restoring constitutional respect and unity, positioning himself as an alternative to the polarized political landscape. END OF SUMMARY.
