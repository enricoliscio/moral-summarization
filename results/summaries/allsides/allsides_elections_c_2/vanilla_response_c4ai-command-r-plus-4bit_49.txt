SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination. Amash, a former Republican, has been toying with the idea of a third-party campaign for months and is now taking his first steps toward a potential bid. He has gained a national profile for his vocal attacks against the White House and his libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending. Amash would be the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 race, and it is unclear if he would draw more support away from President Trump or the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. Some speculate that Amash could appeal to "Never Trump" Republicans and Libertarians, but his impact on the election remains to be seen.
END OF SUMMARY.
