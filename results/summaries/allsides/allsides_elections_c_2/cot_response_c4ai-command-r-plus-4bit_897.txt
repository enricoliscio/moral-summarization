SUMMARY: 
Rep. Justin Amash has announced the launch of an exploratory committee for seeking the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, signaling a potential third-party White House bid. Amash, a former Republican turned Independent, has centered his political career on libertarian values, advocating for limited government intervention and fiscal conservatism. His vocal attacks against the White House and support for impeachment have earned him visceral rebukes from the GOP and a handful of Republican challengers. Amash's criticism of Republicans for excusing the president's "misbehavior" and abandoning fiscal conservatism could tarnish their reputation in history. Libertarians view Amash as a potential game-changer in the 2020 election, believing he could be "acceptable" to Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans alike. While it is unclear if Amash would draw more support from Trump or Biden, his candidacy offers an attractive third-party option for Republicans tired of the current administration. Amash's exploratory committee is the strongest indication yet of his presidential ambitions, and he is expected to face off against other Libertarians for the party's nomination.
