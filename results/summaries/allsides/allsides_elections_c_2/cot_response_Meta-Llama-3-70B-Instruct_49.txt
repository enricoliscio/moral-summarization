SUMMARY:
Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, citing a need for "practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people." Amash, a former Republican congressman, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, accusing the GOP of abandoning fiscal conservatism and turning a blind eye to "misbehavior" to appease the president. His criticism has earned visceral rebukes from the GOP. Amash's potential third-party bid could be a game-changer, bringing a "respect for our Constitution" and "bringing people together." He would be an attractive option for "Never Trump" Republicans and those seeking a more humble approach to politics. END OF SUMMARY.
