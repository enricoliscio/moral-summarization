Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified certain morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

Rep. Justin Amash is launching an exploratory committee for the Libertarian nomination. He's a former Republican who's been considering a third-party run. The article mentions protests, restore, bring, serving, exploding, misbehavior, excusing, defenses, and assault. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

Amash's main points are about restoring constitutional respect and bringing people together. He's a third-party candidate, which might draw support from Never Trump Republicans. His focus is on less government intervention and cutting federal spending to offset the deficit. He left the GOP because they abandoned fiscal conservatism and excused Trump's misbehavior.

The article also mentions potential impact on the election, whether he'll draw from Trump or Biden supporters. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral words.

I'll start by stating Amash's announcement, his goals, the pressure from Libertarians, his values, and the impact on the election. I'll make sure to include all the moral terms where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all key points with the required moral framing.

SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Partyâ€™s presidential nomination, signaling his intent to run as a third-party candidate. Amash, who has long advocated for libertarian values like less government intervention and reduced federal spending, aims to "restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together." His announcement comes amid protests and frustration with the political landscape, as he seeks to serve Americans of all backgrounds. Amash, who left the GOP last year, criticized Republicans for excusing President Trump's misbehavior and failing to defend fiscal conservatism. His potential candidacy could draw support from "Never Trump" Republicans and Libertarian voters, potentially impacting the 2020 election. While it remains unclear whether he would siphon votes from Trump or Biden, his focus on practical, humble leadership and constitutional respect highlights his bid as a moral alternative. END OF SUMMARY.
