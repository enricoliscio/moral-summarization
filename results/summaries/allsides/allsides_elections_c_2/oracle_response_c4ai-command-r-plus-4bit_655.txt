SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, indicating he may mount a third-party White House bid. Amash has built his political career on libertarian values, advocating for less government intervention and sharp cuts in federal spending to restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together. His decision comes after months of toying with the prospect and facing pressure from Libertarians. Amash's national profile has soared due to his vocal attacks against the White House and his support for Democrats in their impeachment effort. He has criticized Republicans for excusing the president's misbehavior and abandoning fiscal conservatism, earning him visceral rebukes from the GOP. While it is unclear whose votes Amash would draw more support from, he would be the most prominent third-party contender in the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
