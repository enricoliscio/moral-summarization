SUMMARY: Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, signaling his intention to run for president as a third-party candidate. Amash, who has built his political career around libertarian values and advocating for limited government and fiscal conservatism, left the GOP last year due to disagreements with the party's direction under President Trump. Amash's potential bid is seen as a significant development, as he could appeal to both Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans. However, it is unclear if his candidacy would draw more support from Trump or Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Amash's national profile has grown due to his vocal criticism of the White House, and he would be the most prominent third-party candidate in the 2020 election if he wins the Libertarian nomination. His announcement underscores his commitment to restoring respect for the Constitution and bringing Americans together.
END OF SUMMARY.
