SUMMARY: Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, has announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, positioning himself as a principled alternative to President Trump and former Vice President Biden. Amash, who left the GOP last year due to concerns over fiscal conservatism and the party's loyalty to Trump, has built his political career on libertarian values, advocating for limited government and reduced federal spending. Amash's exploratory committee signals his strongest indication yet of a third-party bid, and he would be the most prominent contender for the White House from a third party this election cycle. His potential candidacy has sparked interest among Libertarians and 'Never Trump' Republicans, who see him as a viable option to break the two-party hold on the presidency. Amash's national profile has grown due to his vocal criticism of the Trump administration, including his support for the impeachment effort. However, it remains to be seen whether his campaign would draw more support away from Trump or Biden.
END OF SUMMARY.
