SUMMARY: Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, has launched an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, signaling a potential third-party bid for the White House. Amash has built his political career on libertarian values, advocating for limited government intervention and fiscal conservatism. He gained national attention for his vocal criticism of President Trump and his decision to support the Democrats' impeachment effort, which led to his departure from the GOP. Amash's potential third-party candidacy has sparked interest among Libertarians and "Never Trump" Republicans, who see him as a viable contender who could bring their parties to a "tipping point" in the 2020 election. While it is unclear how his candidacy would impact the race between Trump and Biden, Amash offers a unique option for voters who are dissatisfied with the current front-runners. Amash's commitment to restoring respect for the Constitution and uniting Americans from all backgrounds underscores his moral framework for public service.
