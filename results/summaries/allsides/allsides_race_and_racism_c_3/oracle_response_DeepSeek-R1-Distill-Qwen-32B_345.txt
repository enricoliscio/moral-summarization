Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article discusses how George Floyd's death has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle against racial violence in America. It compares his case to previous significant events like Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown. Each of these incidents involved violence, killings, and police brutality, which are all on the list of moral words I need to include.

The author mentions that Floyd's death was unique because it involved being跪下 (knee pressed) into his neck for nearly nine minutes, which was captured on video. This visual evidence made it harder to justify the use of lethal force, highlighting the brutality and senselessness of the act.

The summary should also touch on the broader context: the pandemic's disproportionate impact on Black Americans, economic crises, and the political climate under Trump. These factors contributed to the widespread protests, making the situation combustible.

I need to make sure to include words like violence, brutality, killings, lynching, riots, and systemic racism. I should structure the summary to show how Floyd's death was the tipping point, linking it to past incidents and the current social and economic crises.

I'll start by stating that Floyd's death is a marker of racial violence, similar to past events. Then, I'll explain why his case was unique, focusing on the circumstances and the video evidence. Next, I'll connect it to the broader context, including the pandemic and economic issues, and how these factors led to widespread protests. Finally, I'll mention the ongoing legal cases and the systemic issues they highlight.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include as many moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and impactful.

SUMMARY: George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police has become a defining moment in America’s history of racial violence, joining the ranks of Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown as symbols of systemic injustice. Floyd’s killing, captured on graphic video, stands out due to the circumstances of his death—nine minutes of an officer’s knee pressed into his neck—highlighting the brutality and senselessness of the act. This incident, alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has sparked nationwide protests, fueled by the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black Americans and months of lockdown frustrations. President Trump’s incendiary rhetoric further stoked tensions. Floyd’s death is seen as a tipping point, reigniting the fight against police violence and systemic racism. Legal actions against those involved in these killings, including charges of murder and manslaughter, continue to keep the issue in the public eye, underscoring the enduring struggle for justice.
