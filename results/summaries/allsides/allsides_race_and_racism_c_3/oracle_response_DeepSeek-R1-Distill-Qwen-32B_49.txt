Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about George Floyd's death and how it sparked a movement, comparing it to other significant events in history. The author mentions other cases like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, highlighting the systemic issues and the broader context of the pandemic and economic crisis.

I should start by introducing Floyd's death as a pivotal moment, using words like "killed" and "lynching." Then, mention the other cases with terms like "gunned down" and "shot." I need to include the impact of the video footage and how it led to nationwide protests, using words like "brutality" and "riots."

Next, I'll address the systemic issues, using terms like "racism," "disproportionate," and "crises." It's important to note the ongoing legal cases and the charges against the officers, using "murder" and "manslaughter."

I should also touch on the broader context, including the pandemic and unemployment, using "combustible" and "inequalities." Finally, I'll conclude with the significance of Floyd's death as a tipping point, emphasizing the moral framing throughout.

Now, I'll structure this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key morally charged words.

SUMMARY:  
George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police has become a pivotal moment in the fight against systemic racism, joining the ranks of other iconic cases like Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown. Floyd’s killing, captured on video, revealed the brutality of having an officer’s knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparking nationwide protests and outrage. This incident follows a string of controversial killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, who was gunned down while jogging, Breonna Taylor, who was shot eight times by police, and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police. These deaths, along with the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black Americans, have fueled a movement that reflects the weight of systemic racism. The video of Floyd’s death, with its graphic footage, exposed the senselessness of his killing and the anger that had been building over decades of police violence. The protests, which have spread across the U.S., are driven by a combination of unemployment, health inequalities, and the incendiary rhetoric of leaders. As court cases proceed, Floyd’s death remains a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice and equality. END OF SUMMARY.
