SUMMARY: America has a long history of racial violence, and certain names have become synonymous with the struggles of their time. George Floyd's name will likely join this list, as his death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests and a movement against police brutality and racial injustice. Floyd's death was unique in its circumstances; he died with an officer's knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and multiple videos captured the graphic and senseless nature of his killing. The anger and discontent over Floyd's death had been building for years, with other incidents such as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade also sparking outrage. The larger context of the coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate impact on black Americans, along with President Trump's inflammatory responses to the early protests, likely contributed to the widespread anger and demonstrations. The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with murder, and the issue of police violence will likely remain in the spotlight as court cases continue. Floyd's death was a spark that ignited a country already on the brink, and his name will be remembered as a pivotal moment in the fight for racial justice.
