SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, has sparked widespread protests and outrage across the United States and beyond. Floyd's death is the latest in a series of recent controversial killings of black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. What sets Floyd's case apart is the circumstance of his death; he died after an officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, which was captured on video and provided indisputable evidence of the brutality he endured. The incident has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for racial justice and has sparked a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the defining moments of the decade. The protests and anger reflect a country already on the brink due to mass unemployment, a pandemic that has exposed health and economic inequalities, and a president whose responses to the protests have been inflammatory. The legal cases surrounding Floyd's death and the deaths of Arbery and McDade are likely to keep the issue of police violence in the spotlight for some time.
