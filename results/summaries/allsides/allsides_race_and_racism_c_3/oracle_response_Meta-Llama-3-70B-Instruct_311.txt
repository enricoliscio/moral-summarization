SUMMARY: 

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, reminiscent of the civil rights era. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the brutality of police violence, with an officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident, combined with recent controversial killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has brought systemic racism to the forefront. The circumstances of Floyd's death, including the graphic footage, left little room for uncertainty, and the nation's anger boiled over. The coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black Americans, and President Trump's incendiary tweets, further fueled the protests. The officer involved has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting. The ongoing court cases will likely keep police violence in the news, as the country grapples with its combustible mix of unemployment, inequalities, and racism.
