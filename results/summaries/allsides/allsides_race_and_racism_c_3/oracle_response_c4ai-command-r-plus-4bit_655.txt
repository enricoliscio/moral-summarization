SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis, has sparked nationwide protests and a racial reckoning that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of this decade. Floyd's death is the latest in a string of recent controversial killings of black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. What sets Floyd's case apart is the brutal manner in which he died, with an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, which was captured on video and widely circulated. The graphic footage left no room for uncertainty and sparked outrage across the country. This outrage was likely fueled by a buildup of anger over similar incidents and the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on black Americans. The officer involved in Floyd's killing has been charged with murder and manslaughter, and three other officers face charges as well. The reaction to Floyd's death highlights a nation already on the brink, with systemic racism and inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. The protests and demonstrations show that the weight of systemic racism and injustice has become too much to bear for many Americans.
