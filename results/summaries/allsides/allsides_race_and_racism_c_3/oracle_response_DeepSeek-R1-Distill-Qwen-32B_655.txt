Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words to include. I need to make sure the summary uses as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how George Floyd's death became a pivotal moment in the movement against police violence, similar to other significant events in history. The article mentions other cases like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, and how Floyd's death, captured on video, sparked widespread protests. It also ties in the context of the pandemic and economic issues.

I need to include terms like violence, lynching, brutality, killings, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Floyd's death as a catalyst, mention the other cases, and the broader context. I'll make sure to use the key moral words without making the summary too long. Let me draft a concise version, ensuring all important points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article examines how George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police has become a defining moment in the fight against racial violence, joining historical figures like Emmett Till and Rodney King. Floyd’s killing, captured on video, highlights the brutality of police force, as an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident, part of a series of recent killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has sparked nationwide protests. The moral framing emphasizes the senselessness of Floyd’s death, the disproportionate impact of systemic racism, and the tinderbox of anger fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic crises, and police violence. The article notes that Floyd’s death, unlike many others, was caught on video, providing clear evidence of the violence, which has galvanized a movement. The protests, driven by a combination of unemployment, health disparities, and incendiary rhetoric, have brought the issue of police violence to the forefront. Ongoing court cases, including charges of murder and manslaughter against the officers involved, will likely keep the issue in the news. The article underscores the combustible mix of factors that have made Floyd’s death a pivotal moment in the fight against systemic racism and police brutality. END OF SUMMARY.
