SUMMARY: America has a long history of racial violence, with certain names becoming enduring symbols of the struggle for racial justice. George Floyd's name will likely join this list, as the way he died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests and a movement against police brutality and systemic racism. Floyd's death was one of several recent controversial killings of black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. What set Floyd's case apart was the circumstances of his death â€” a slow and senseless killing, with graphic footage that left little room for uncertainty. The incident served as a tipping point for anger that had been building over similar incidents, and it occurred amid the health and economic crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected the black community. The combination of these factors led to a movement that will likely be remembered as a pivotal moment in the fight for racial equality. Charges have been filed against the officers involved in Floyd's death and the killing of Arbery, but there is still a long way to go in addressing police violence and systemic racism in the US.
