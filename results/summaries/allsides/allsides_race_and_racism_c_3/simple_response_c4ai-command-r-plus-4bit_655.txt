SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis has sparked nationwide protests and a racial reckoning in the United States. Floyd's death, which occurred during a period of heightened racial tension and in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for racial justice.

Floyd's death was unique in that it was captured on video, showing the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. This graphic footage, combined with the recent killings of other black individuals like Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, became a tipping point for anger and frustration that had been building for years. The protests that followed Floyd's death spread across the country and have led to a broader movement for racial equality and an end to police brutality.

The circumstances of Floyd's killing, the broader context of the time, and the subsequent nationwide reaction have all contributed to making his name synonymous with a pivotal moment in the fight for racial justice. As the country continues to grapple with its legacy of racial violence and systemic racism, Floyd's death serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for change and the power of individual acts of injustice to spark widespread movements for change.
