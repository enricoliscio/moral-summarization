SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd, an African American man, by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked nationwide protests and a racial reckoning that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of this decade. Floyd's death, which occurred as a result of an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, was captured on video and provided a detailed and disturbing account of what transpired. This incident is part of a string of recent controversial killings of black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. While each of these incidents drew national attention and outrage, it was Floyd's death that served as the tipping point for a country already grappling with mass unemployment, a pandemic that disproportionately affected black Americans, and a long history of racial violence and injustice. The unique and brutal circumstances of Floyd's death, combined with the visual evidence, have sparked a movement that demands an end to systemic racism and police brutality. The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, while three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting. The protests and demonstrations across the country are a testament to the enduring struggle for racial equality and justice in America.
