SUMMARY:
America has a long history of racial violence, and the recent killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked nationwide protests and a moral movement against police brutality and systemic racism. Floyd's death, along with other recent controversial killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has brought to light the persistent issue of police violence against Black Americans. The graphic video footage of Floyd's death, where an officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has outraged people across the country. This incident, along with the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black communities and the inflammatory rhetoric from President Trump, has acted as a tinderbox for the spreading of protests and anger. The weight of systemic racism and police violence has become too much to bear, and the country is now facing a pivotal moment in the fight for racial justice. Charges have been filed against the officers involved in Floyd's killing and the Arbery case, but there is still a long way to go in addressing the systemic issues that plague our society. Floyd's death was the spark, and the country is now grappling with the flames of injustice that have been burning for far too long.
