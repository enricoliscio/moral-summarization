SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has sparked widespread protests and a national conversation about racial injustice and police brutality. Floyd's death is being compared to other landmark moments in the struggle for racial equality, such as the lynching of Emmett Till and the beating of Rodney King. The unusual circumstances of Floyd's death, captured on video, and the context of the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the magnitude of the response. Floyd's death was part of a string of recent controversial killings of Black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. While the protests continue across the country, court cases related to these incidents are ongoing. Many believe that Floyd's death served as a spark for a country that was already on the brink, with rising anger over police brutality, economic inequality, and racial injustice. The senseless nature of Floyd's death, captured on video, also played a significant role in galvanizing public outrage.
