Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll identify the morally framed words. The article talks about racial violence, lynching, brutality, acquittal, riots, police killings, Black Lives Matter, tipping point, anger, health and economic crises, lockdown, incendiary tweets, tinder, combustible, mass unemployment, pandemic, inequalities, teenagers, police violence, right-wingers, second civil war, gasoline on every fire, senselessness, revolution, systemic racism. 

Now, I'll write a concise summary using these terms. It should be under 200 words and include the moral elements. I'll start by highlighting George Floyd's death as a pivotal moment, mention other incidents, the role of video evidence, the context of the pandemic and unemployment, and the ongoing legal cases. I'll also touch on the systemic issues and the broader societal factors that contributed to the protests.

**SUMMARY:**
George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police has become a pivotal moment in the fight against racial injustice, joining the ranks of Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown as symbols of systemic racism. The video of Floyd's death, where an officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, exposed the senselessness of his killing and sparked nationwide protests. This incident followed other tragic deaths, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, each drawing national attention. The timing, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate impact on Black Americans and economic hardship, fueled widespread anger. Protests, initially sparked by Floyd's death, were further inflamed by President Trump's inflammatory rhetoric. The ongoing legal cases against those involved in these killings highlight the enduring struggle against police violence and systemic racism. END OF SUMMARY.
