SUMMARY:
Throughout America's long history of racial violence, certain names have stood out as markers of the struggles of a particular period in time. George Floyd's name will almost certainly join that list given the extraordinary nationwide reaction to the way he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Floyd's death was part of a string of recent controversial killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The circumstance of Floyd's death, with an officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparked a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade. The incident can't be separated from the larger context of the health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which have affected black Americans at a disproportionate level, highlighting the senselessness and brutality of systemic racism.
