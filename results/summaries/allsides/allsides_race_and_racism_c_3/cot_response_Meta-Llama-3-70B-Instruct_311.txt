SUMMARY:
The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, reminiscent of pivotal moments in America's history of racial violence. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the brutality and senselessness of the act, leaving no room for uncertainty over what took place. The incident was the tipping point of anger that had been building over recent controversial killings, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which have disproportionately affected black Americans, added to the discontent. The demonstrations across the country are a response to the systemic racism and police violence that have become too much to bear. The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and ongoing court cases will likely keep the issue in the news. END OF SUMMARY.
