SUMMARY:

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, joining the ranks of Emmett Till, Rodney King, and Eric Garner as markers of racial violence in America. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the senseless brutality of police violence, with an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The incident was the tipping point of anger building over recent controversial killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The context of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black Americans, and President Trump's incendiary tweets, also contributed to the widespread outrage. The officer involved has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and ongoing court cases will likely keep police violence in the news. The movement sparked by Floyd's death is a culmination of escalating anger and frustration over systemic racism, which has become too much to bear. END OF SUMMARY.
