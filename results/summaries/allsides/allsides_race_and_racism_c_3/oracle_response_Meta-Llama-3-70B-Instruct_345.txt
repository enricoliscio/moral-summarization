SUMMARY:

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, reminiscent of pivotal moments in America's history of racial violence. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the brutality of police violence, with an officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident, combined with recent controversial killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has brought the Black Lives Matter movement to the forefront. The context of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black Americans, and President Trump's incendiary tweets, may have contributed to the widespread outrage. The officer involved in Floyd's death has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, while three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting. The ongoing court cases will likely keep police violence in the news, highlighting the systemic racism and inequalities that have become too much to bear. END OF SUMMARY.
