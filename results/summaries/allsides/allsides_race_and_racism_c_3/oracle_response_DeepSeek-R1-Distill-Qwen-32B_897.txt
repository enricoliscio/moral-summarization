Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It discusses how George Floyd's death has become a significant marker in the ongoing struggle against racial violence in America. The article compares it to past events like Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, highlighting how each case sparked movements. 

I notice the author uses strong moral terms like "violence," "lynching," "brutality," and "killings." My summary must include as many of these words as possible. I'll focus on the key events: Floyd's death, the role of video evidence, the context of the pandemic and unemployment, and the systemic racism highlighted by these incidents. 

I'll structure the summary to start with Floyd's death as a pivotal moment, mention the prior cases, the circumstances that made his case unique, and the broader context of inequality and police violence. I'll also touch on the legal actions taken and the ongoing protests. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence adds value without being redundant. I'll avoid introducing new information not in the article. Finally, I'll ensure that the moral terms are preserved to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY:  
The death of George Floyd, caused by a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle against racial violence in America. Floyd’s killing, captured on graphic video, joins the ranks of other tragic deaths—such as Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown—that have sparked national outrage and movements for justice. Unlike many police killings, Floyd’s death was not by gunfire but through the brutal application of force, which left little room for ambiguity. This incident, combined with the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black Americans and months of lockdown frustration, served as a tipping point for widespread anger. The video of Floyd’s death, his plea for breath, and the systemic racism it symbolized, have fueled nationwide protests and a renewed focus on police violence. Legal actions, including charges of murder and manslaughter against the officers involved, continue to keep the issue in the spotlight. Floyd’s death has become a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for racial justice in the U.S., highlighting the weight of systemic inequality and the senselessness of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
