SUMMARY:
Throughout America's history of racial violence, certain names have stood out as markers of the struggles of a particular period in time. George Floyd's name will almost certainly join that list given the extraordinary nationwide reaction to the brutal way he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Floyd's death was part of a string of recent controversial killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The circumstance of Floyd's death, with an officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparked a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade. The incident was the tipping point of anger that had been building over months of lockdown measures, police violence, and systemic racism. The ongoing court cases will likely keep the issue of police violence in the news, and the demonstrations in cities across the country may continue to spread. END OF SUMMARY.
