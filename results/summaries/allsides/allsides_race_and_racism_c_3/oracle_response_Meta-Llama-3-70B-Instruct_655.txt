SUMMARY:

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, reminiscent of pivotal moments in America's history of racial violence. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the brutality of the police officer's actions, with a knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident, combined with recent controversial killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has brought the issue of police violence to the forefront. The circumstances of Floyd's death, including the graphic footage, have left little room for uncertainty, and the incident has been widely condemned. The movement sparked by Floyd's death is likely to be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade, with ongoing court cases set to keep the issue of police violence in the news. The incident has also highlighted the systemic racism and inequalities faced by black Americans, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. The author suggests that the country was already "combustible" due to mass unemployment, health and economic inequalities, and police violence, and Floyd's death was the spark that ignited the flames.
