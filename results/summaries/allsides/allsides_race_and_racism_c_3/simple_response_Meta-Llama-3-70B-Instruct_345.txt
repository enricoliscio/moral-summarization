SUMMARY:

The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, reminiscent of pivotal moments in America's history of racial violence. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the brutality of police violence, evoking memories of Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown. The circumstances of Floyd's death, including the officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes, left no room for uncertainty. The incident was the tipping point of anger built over recent controversial killings, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The coronavirus pandemic, which disproportionately affects black Americans, and President Trump's incendiary tweets, further fueled the outrage. The movement will likely continue, with ongoing court cases keeping police violence in the news. The moral imperative is clear: systemic racism has become too much to bear, and it's time for change.
