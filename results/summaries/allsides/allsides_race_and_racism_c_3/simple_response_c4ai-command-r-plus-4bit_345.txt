SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis has sparked nationwide protests and a racial reckoning that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of this decade. Floyd's death is the latest in a string of controversial killings of black individuals, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. What sets Floyd's case apart is the gruesome circumstance of his death, with graphic footage showing an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident was the tipping point of anger that had been building over similar incidents, and it occurred amidst the health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which disproportionately affected black communities. The combination of these factors has led to a movement demanding an end to systemic racism and police brutality. The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with murder, and three other officers face charges as well. The protests and court cases will likely keep the issue of police violence and racial injustice in the national spotlight for the foreseeable future.
