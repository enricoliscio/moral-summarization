Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about how George Floyd's death has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle against racial injustice in the US. It mentions other significant events like Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, showing how each era has its markers. Floyd's case is unique because of the circumstances of his deathâ€”being held down with a knee for nearly nine minutes, captured on video. This video made it hard to deny the brutality, leading to widespread protests.

The article also connects Floyd's death to previous incidents involving Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, which had already sparked national responses. It suggests that Floyd's case was the tipping point, especially in Minneapolis, and ties into the broader context of the pandemic's disproportionate impact on Black Americans and the economic crisis.

Looking at the moral framing, the article emphasizes systemic racism, police violence, and the role of media in exposing these issues. The user wants a summary that captures this moral perspective, highlighting the significance of Floyd's death as a catalyst for change.

I should structure the summary to include the historical context, the uniqueness of Floyd's case, the role of video evidence, the connection to other incidents, and the broader societal issues. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements and maintain the moral tone. I'll start by mentioning the historical markers, then Floyd's case, the video impact, the connection to other events, and the societal context. Finally, I'll note the ongoing legal cases and the perspectives mentioned, like Michelle Goldberg and Mitch Albom's points.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and captures the essence of why Floyd's death was so significant in the moral context of racial justice.
