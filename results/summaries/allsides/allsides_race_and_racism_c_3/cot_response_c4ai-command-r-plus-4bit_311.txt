SUMMARY:
America's long history of racial violence has seen certain names become enduring figures that mark the struggles of their time. George Floyd's name will almost certainly join this list due to the circumstances of his death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Floyd's death was part of a string of recent *controversial killings*, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. While each incident drew some national response, it was Floyd's death that sparked a movement. The *brutality* and *senselessness* of his death, captured on video, outraged the nation and served as a tipping point for anger that had been building over police *violence* and systemic racism. This anger was likely compounded by the *crises* caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which disproportionately affected black Americans. The *demonstrations* and court cases that followed Floyd's death have kept the issue of police *violence* and *murder* in the spotlight. The officer who killed Floyd has been *charged* with second-degree *murder* and manslaughter, while three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting. The *killing* of Ahmaud Arbery has also led to *murder* charges for three men. The weight of systemic racism and *violence* became too much to bear, sparking a movement that will be remembered as a pivotal moment in history.
