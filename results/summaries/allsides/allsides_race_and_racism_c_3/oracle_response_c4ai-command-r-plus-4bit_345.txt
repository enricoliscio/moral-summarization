SUMMARY: America has a long history of racial violence, with certain names becoming markers of the struggles of their time. George Floyd's name will likely join this list, as his death sparked a movement against police violence and systemic racism. Floyd's death, caused by an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, was captured on video and provided a detailed account of the incident. The circumstances of his death, the context of recent controversial killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, and the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic, all contributed to the nationwide reaction. The way Floyd died, as seen in the video, showed the senselessness and brutality of the act, with the weight of systemic racism becoming too much to bear. The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with murder and manslaughter, and his death has sparked ongoing demonstrations and court cases. The anger and discontent in the country, fueled by the pandemic and inflammatory political rhetoric, spread across the U.S., making Floyd's death a pivotal moment in the fight for racial justice.
