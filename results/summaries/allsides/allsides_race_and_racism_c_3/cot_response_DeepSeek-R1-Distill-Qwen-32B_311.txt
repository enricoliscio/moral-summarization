Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a detailed query with specific instructions. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about George Floyd's death and its impact on the Black Lives Matter movement. The morally charged words include things like "brutality," "lynching," "killed," "racism," "inequality," etc. I should list each of these words first.

Next, the summary needs to capture the key points: Floyd's death as a tipping point, the context of other incidents like Arbery, Taylor, and McDade, the role of the pandemic, and the ongoing legal actions. I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the moral terms without being too wordy.

I should start by identifying the morally framed words, then craft the summary ensuring it's within the word limit and retains the moral perspective. Let me make sure each step is clearly marked and the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

### SUMMARY:  
The article examines how George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police became a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle against racial injustice. Floyd's killing, captured on video, joins the ranks of other iconic cases like Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, which have shaped the nation's understanding of systemic racism. The circumstances of Floyd's death—being restrained with a knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes—made it particularly egregious and impossible to ignore. This incident, along with the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, highlights the persistence of police violence and racial inequality. The convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic hardship, and months of lockdown likely fueled the widespread protests. Floyd's death has sparked a movement that reflects the weight of systemic racism and the demand for accountability, with ongoing court cases ensuring the issue remains in the public eye.
