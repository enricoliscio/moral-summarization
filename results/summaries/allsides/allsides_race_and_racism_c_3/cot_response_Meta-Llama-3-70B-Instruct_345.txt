SUMMARY:
Throughout America's long history of racial violence, certain names have stood out as markers of the struggles of a particular period in time. George Floyd's death, which was part of a string of recent controversial killings, sparked a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade. The circumstance of his death, where an officer's knee was pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes, was particularly brutal and senseless. The incident was the tipping point of anger that had been building over the incidents involving Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many others. The demonstrations across the country were fueled by discontent over months of lockdown measures and President Trump's incendiary tweets. The ongoing court cases will likely keep the issue of police violence in the news, highlighting the systemic racism and murderous inequalities that have affected black Americans at a disproportionate level.
