SUMMARY: America has a long history of racial violence, and the killing of George Floyd is the latest in a string of tragic incidents that have brought this issue to the forefront. Floyd's death, caused by an officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, was captured on video and sparked nationwide protests and a movement against police brutality and systemic racism. The graphic footage of his death showed the senselessness and brutality of the killing, leaving no room for uncertainty. Floyd's case is unique due to the circumstances of his death and the context of escalating anger over similar recent incidents involving Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate impact on black Americans, along with President Trump's incendiary responses to early protests, likely contributed to the widespread anger and demonstrations. The officer responsible for Floyd's death has been charged with murder and manslaughter, while three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting. The country is on the brink, with mass unemployment, inequalities, and a president who seems eager to pour gasoline on every fire. The weight of systemic racism has become too much to bear, and Floyd's death may be remembered as a pivotal moment in the fight for racial justice.
