Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about George Floyd's death and its impact on the Black Lives Matter movement. It mentions other incidents like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. I should highlight how Floyd's case was unique because of the circumstancesâ€”being held down with a knee for nine minutes, and the widespread video footage. Also, the context of the pandemic and economic issues played a role. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral aspects, like systemic racism and the tipping point for the movement. Let me structure it to first mention the historical context, then Floyd's case, the unique factors, the broader context, and the implications for the future. I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and concise.
