Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how George Floyd's death has become a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle against police violence and systemic racism in the US. It compares his case to other significant events like Emmett Till, Rodney King, and the Black Lives Matter movement. The article also mentions other incidents like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, highlighting how these events contributed to the current protests.

I need to make sure that the summary includes the key morally framed words. Let me list them again: violence, lynching, brutality, beating, acquittal, riots, killings, lynched, beaten, killed, death, gunned, shot, busted, incidents, died, pressed, shootings, force, incident, crises, disproportionate, incendiary, caused, spread, kneeled, murder, manslaughter, aiding, abetting, killing, deaths, combustible, unemployment, inequalities, itching, war, eager, pour, fire, racism.

I should structure the summary to cover the main events and their moral implications. Start with Floyd's death as a marker, mention the other incidents, the context of the pandemic and unemployment, and the systemic issues. Also, include the legal actions taken against the officers involved.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. For example, when talking about the circumstances, I can use "knee pressed into his neck" and mention the video evidence. Also, highlight the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Black Americans.

I should avoid adding any new information not present in the article. The summary should reflect the author's framing, emphasizing the systemic issues and the tipping point effect of Floyd's death. I'll make sure to include the legal outcomes and the ongoing nature of the movement.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to make sure I haven't missed any key points or moral framing elements.

SUMMARY:  
The death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has become a defining moment in the ongoing struggle against police violence and systemic racism in the U.S. Floyd’s death, captured on video, joins a tragic list of racially charged incidents, including the lynching of Emmett Till, the beating of Rodney King, and the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The circumstances of Floyd’s death—his prolonged suffocation under the officer’s knee—made it particularly vivid and unforgettable, sparking nationwide protests and a movement that reflects the weight of systemic racism. Other recent killings, such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, also drew national attention but Floyd’s case became the tipping point, fueled by the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black Americans and months of lockdown frustration. The protests, marked by anger and calls for justice, have been further influenced by President Trump’s incendiary rhetoric. Legal actions, including charges of murder and manslaughter against the officers involved, will keep the issue in the spotlight. Floyd’s death has reignited a national reckoning with violence, inequality, and the combustible mix of unemployment and health crises, highlighting the enduring struggle for racial justice. END OF SUMMARY.
