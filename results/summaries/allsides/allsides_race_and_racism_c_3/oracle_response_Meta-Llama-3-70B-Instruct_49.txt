SUMMARY:

The brutal killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has sparked a nationwide movement, joining the ranks of Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown as markers of racial violence in America. Floyd's death, caught on video, showed the senselessness of his killing, with an officer's knee pressed into his neck for nearly nine minutes. This incident, combined with the recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, has brought the issue of police violence to the forefront. The context of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black Americans, and President Trump's incendiary tweets have fueled the anger and discontent. The officer involved in Floyd's killing has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and ongoing court cases will likely keep the issue of police violence in the news. The weight of systemic racism has become too much to bear, sparking a movement that will likely be remembered as one of the pivotal moments of the decade.
