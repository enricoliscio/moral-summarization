SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, has sparked nationwide protests and a renewed focus on racial injustice and police brutality. Floyd's death was captured on video, which showed the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, leading to widespread outrage and calls for justice. Floyd's death is being compared to other landmark cases of racial violence, such as the killings of Emmett Till, Rodney King, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown. The protests sparked by Floyd's death are part of a larger movement against systemic racism and police brutality, and they have been influenced by other recent incidents, including the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. The protests have also been shaped by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted Black communities. As court cases related to these incidents continue, the issue of police violence and racial injustice remains at the forefront of national attention.
