Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user provided the article and an example response, so I should follow that structure. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points from the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It discusses how George Floyd's death is a pivotal moment, similar to other significant events in history. It mentions other cases like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, and how Floyd's case was unique because of the circumstances of his deathâ€”being filmed, leading to widespread attention. It also touches on the broader context, like the pandemic and economic issues, which contributed to the protests.

I need to highlight that Floyd's case stands out because of the video evidence and the timing, which came after several other high-profile cases. The article also mentions the ongoing legal cases and the systemic issues that led to the protests.

I should structure the summary to include:
1. Introduction of Floyd's case as a significant event.
2. Comparison to historical events.
3. Unique aspects of his death (video evidence, method of killing).
4. Broader context (pandemic, economic issues, Trump's response).
5. Ongoing legal actions and systemic issues.

I'll make sure to keep it within 200 words, using clear and concise language. I'll avoid including too many details from each case, focusing instead on the overall impact and significance of Floyd's death.

SUMMARY:  
The article examines why George Floyd's death has become a pivotal moment in the fight against racial injustice. Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer, captured on video, stands out due to the prolonged nature of his restraint and the widespread visibility of the footage. His case joins historical markers like Emmett Till, Rodney King, and Eric Garner, symbolizing systemic racial violence. Unlike many police killings, Floyd's death was filmed, providing undeniable evidence of his suffering, which fueled national outrage. This outrage was amplified by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic hardship, and prior cases like Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade. Floyd's death is seen as a tipping point, sparking widespread protests and drawing attention to systemic racism. Legal cases against those involved in these incidents are ongoing, with charges filed in some but not all cases. The movement has highlighted the deep-seated issues of police violence and racial inequality in America. END OF SUMMARY.
