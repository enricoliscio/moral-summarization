Okay, I need to summarize this news article about John Bolton's book and the moral framing around it. The user wants the summary to preserve the author's moral perspective. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Bolton's upcoming book, which accuses Trump of various misconducts, including seeking election help from China, supporting China's treatment of Muslims, talking about executing journalists, and the Ukraine dealings leading to impeachment. Trump and his allies dismiss the book as lies, and the administration tried to block its release, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor.

The article also discusses the political reactions. Democrats think the book could have been more impactful during impeachment but now it's less relevant. Liberals criticize Bolton for not coming forward earlier and using it to sell a book. Some argue the book still matters, especially regarding Trump's China policies.

I need to capture the moral angles. On one side, critics see Bolton as self-serving, using his position for personal gain. On the other, his book provides detailed allegations that could still affect Trump's image, especially regarding China. The summary should reflect both the criticism of Bolton's motives and the potential impact of his claims.

I should structure the summary to include Bolton's accusations, the administration's response, the political reactions, and the debate about the book's impact. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by mentioning both the criticism of Bolton's actions and the significance of his allegations.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely. I'll start with the book's accusations, then the administration's reaction, followed by the political debate, and conclude with the potential impact despite Bolton's motives.

SUMMARY:  
John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, supporting its treatment of Muslims, discussing executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine affairs. Trump and his allies dismiss the book as lies, while the administration attempted to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton’s favor, allowing its publication on June 23. Democrats argue Bolton’s testimony during impeachment could have been more impactful, but his delay in releasing the book has lessened its political relevance. Liberals criticize Bolton for using his claims to profit rather than acting in the public interest. Despite his motives, the book’s allegations, particularly about Trump’s conciliatory approach to China, could still damage Trump’s image. The debate highlights Bolton’s self-serving actions versus the potential significance of his claims.  
END OF SUMMARY.
