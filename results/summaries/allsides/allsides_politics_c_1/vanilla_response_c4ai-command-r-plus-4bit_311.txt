SUMMARY: A forthcoming book by former national security advisor John Bolton contains scathing accusations against President Trump, including claims that he sought reelection help from Chinese President Xi Jinping and endorsed China's use of Muslim prison camps. Bolton also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine that were central to the impeachment inquiry. Trump has dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies," while the administration has taken legal action to block its release over classified information claims. The book has prompted strong reactions across the political spectrum, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals accusing him of putting personal profit over the country's interests. Despite Bolton's motives, some argue the book could still be impactful, while others believe it won't change the impeachment saga. The House is considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
