Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words in the text. Let me read through the article again to spot words that carry a moral judgment.

The article talks about John Bolton's book with accusations against Trump. Words like "scathing accusations," "unfit," "help," "best interest," "lies," "made up stories," "get even," "classified information," "flood of claims," "strong reactions," "political spectrum," "allies," "criticisms," "personal profit," "country’s interest," "sell," "claims," "impeachment trial," "GOP senators," "wrongdoing," "political damage," "handling," "coronavirus pandemic," "protests," "coniliatory," "strong adversary," "self-serving," "indispensable," "jaw-dropping," "high-level wrongdoing," "embittered," "memoirs," "background gripes," "valid defense," "impeachment," "objectionable," "lawful behavior."

Now, I need to write a concise summary using these words. I'll structure it to include the main points: Bolton's accusations, Trump's and administration's responses, the legal battle, reactions from both parties, and the potential impact of the book. I'll make sure to keep the moral terms to reflect the original framing.

I should start by introducing Bolton's book and its contents, then mention Trump's dismissal and the legal action. Next, I'll cover the reactions from both Republicans and Democrats, highlighting the criticism from liberals. Finally, I'll note the upcoming release and the potential implications for the election and public perception.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral language. Let me draft the summary now.

**SUMMARY:**

John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of being unfit for office, making decisions for reelection rather than national interest, and engaging in controversial actions like seeking election help from China, endorsing Muslim prison camps, and discussing journalist executions. Trump dismissed the book as lies, and his administration tried to block its release over classified information, but a judge ruled in Bolton’s favor. Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, resigned or was fired in 2019 after policy disputes. Democrats and Republicans avoided subpoenaing him during impeachment. Critics argue Bolton’s book, while impactful, may be self-serving and less relevant now due to the pandemic and racial justice movement. Liberals criticize him for prioritizing personal profit over national interest. The book’s release on June 23 could still damage Trump’s image, especially regarding his conciliatory approach to China. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton’s testimony. Some argue the book will hurt Republican senators who ignored his testimony during impeachment. Others see the accusations as significant, despite Bolton’s motives. **END OF SUMMARY.**
