SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency. Bolton claims Trump made decisions based on selfish reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made-up stories" from a former staffer trying to get even for being fired. Despite Bolton's self-serving motives, the accusations are significant and could still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton, and his book could hurt Republican senators seeking reelection. END OF SUMMARY.
