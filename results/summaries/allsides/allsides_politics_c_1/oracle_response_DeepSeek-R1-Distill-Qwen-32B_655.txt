Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally framed words that must be included. I should start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about John Bolton's upcoming book, which criticizes Trump. It mentions accusations like seeking election help from China, endorsing prison camps, speaking about executing journalists, and Ukraine dealings. Trump and his administration are reacting negatively, calling the book lies and taking legal action. The book's release was approved by a judge. The political implications are discussed, with Democrats and Republicans having different reactions. The summary needs to include words like decisions, speaking, executing, lies, wrongdoing, crisis, justice, refused, voted, let.

I should structure the summary to cover Bolton's accusations, Trump's response, the legal battle, and the political debate. I need to make sure each of the moral words is appropriately placed. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by introducing Bolton's book and the accusations. Then, mention Trump's dismissal and legal action. Next, the political reactions and the impact on the impeachment trial. Finally, the upcoming release and its potential influence. I'll ensure all the required moral words are included without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each point flows logically and all key moral elements are present. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure clarity and that all specified words are incorporated correctly.

SUMMARY: John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on reelection chances rather than national interest, including seeking election help from China, endorsing Muslim prison camps, speaking about executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine. Trump dismissed the book as "lies" and took legal action to block its release, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book, scheduled for release on June 23, has sparked debate: Trump allies echoed his criticisms, while liberals criticized Bolton for using his claims to sell a book rather than share them publicly during the impeachment inquiry. Some argue the accusations could still impact Trump's image, especially regarding his conciliatory approach to China. Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton for testimony, while Republicans argue his claims wouldn't have changed the impeachment outcome. The book highlights Trump's wrongdoing, potentially harming Republican senators seeking reelection and undercutting Trump's image as a strong adversary to China. END OF SUMMARY.
