Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to keep the moral framing the author used. The article is about John Bolton's book and the reactions to it. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Bolton's accusations against Trump, Trump's response, legal actions, and the political implications. It also includes different perspectives on whether Bolton's book is impactful or self-serving.

I need to capture the moral elements. The author presents both sides: Trump's allies dismissing the book as lies, while Democrats see it as significant. There's also criticism from liberals that Bolton is using the book for personal gain instead of sharing info earlier.

I should structure the summary to include Bolton's accusations, Trump's reaction, the legal battle, the political debate around the book's timing and impact, and the different perspectives from various commentators.

I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure it's concise. I'll make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed. Also, I have to end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each part is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing Muslim prison camps, and mishandling Ukraine, which led to his impeachment. Trump dismisses the book as lies, while the administration tried to block its release over classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Democrats argue Bolton's delayed testimony could have been more impactful during impeachment, while liberals criticize him for using his claims to sell a book. Republicans see the book as irrelevant amid the pandemic and racial justice protests. The book's release on June 23 may still affect Trump's image, especially his tough stance on China. Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton. Commentators argue the book could harm Republican senators seeking reelection and provide significant, if self-serving, insights into Trump's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
