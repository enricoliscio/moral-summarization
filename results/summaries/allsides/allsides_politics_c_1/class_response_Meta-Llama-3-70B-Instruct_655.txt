SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and making decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a former staffer seeking revenge for being fired. Despite Trump's allies attempting to undercut the claims, the accusations could still resonate with voters discontent with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. Bolton's claims of Trump's wrongdoing, including severe violations, may have been especially impactful during the impeachment trial. Democrats argue that Bolton put personal profit over the country's interest by sharing his story now rather than months ago. The book's release could still hurt Republican senators seeking reelection who refused to hear Bolton's testimony and voted to acquit. END OF SUMMARY.
