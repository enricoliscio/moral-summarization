SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. The Trump administration attempted to block the book's release, claiming it contains classified information, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book's revelations have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with some arguing that Bolton should have shared his claims publicly months ago, while others believe the book could still be impactful in damaging Trump's reputation. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
