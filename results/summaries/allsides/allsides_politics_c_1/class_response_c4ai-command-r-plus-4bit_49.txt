SUMMARY: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has released a book containing a slew of scathing accusations against President Trump, painting him as unfit for office. Bolton alleges Trump made decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's best interest, including asking for election help from China's Xi Jinping and endorsing their use of Muslim prison camps. Trump dismissed the book as "lies" and the administration tried to block its release, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton resigned/was fired in 2019 and did not testify during the impeachment inquiry or trial. Reactions to the book are mixed, with Trump allies criticizing Bolton's motives and timing, while Democrats argue his testimony could have impacted impeachment. Some argue the accusations are significant despite Bolton's self-serving actions, while others say they wouldn't have changed the impeachment outcome. The book's release could impact Republican senators seeking reelection and Trump's attempts to portray himself as tough on China. House Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. The book reveals severe wrongdoing and violations by the President, who is already facing discontent over his handling of the coronavirus and protests.
END OF SUMMARY.
