SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump has called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" and the administration attempted to block its release, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book's release has sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with some criticizing Bolton for putting personal profit over the country's interest and others arguing the allegations could still be impactful despite his motives. Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
