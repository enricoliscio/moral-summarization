Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally framed words provided. Let me first read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about John Bolton's upcoming book, which accuses Trump of various wrongdoings. Trump and his administration are responding by calling the book a collection of lies and taking legal action. The book's release was blocked but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The article also discusses the political reactions, with Democrats and Republicans having different stances on the impact of the book.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: decisions, speaking, executing, lies, made, wrongdoing, crisis, justice, refused, voted, let. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Bolton's book accuses Trump of unfit decisions, election interference, supporting China's policies, and Ukraine dealings. Trump dismisses the claims as lies and took legal action. The book's release is upcoming, and there's debate over its impact, especially regarding the impeachment trial. Some argue it could still influence voters, while others think it's too late. The summary should capture these elements using the specified moral terms.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing. I'll structure it to first mention the accusations, then Trump's response, followed by the political reactions and implications. I'll ensure each morally framed word is appropriately placed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure clarity and that the moral framing is preserved as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, and engaging in Ukraine dealings that led to impeachment. Trump dismissed the book as a "compilation of lies," and the administration tried to block its release, claiming it contained classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Democrats argue Bolton's testimony during impeachment could have exposed Trump's wrongdoing, but Republicans declined to call him. Critics say the book, set for release on June 23, may still impact voters amid a health crisis and racial justice movement. Some argue it could undercut Trump's image as a strong adversary to China. The book's claims may hurt Republican senators who refused to hear Bolton's testimony and voted to acquit Trump. Despite Bolton's self-serving motives, the allegations of wrongdoing are significant and could resonate with voters. END OF SUMMARY.
