SUMMARY: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has written a book containing scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for office and alleging he made decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's interests. The book includes claims such as Trump seeking election help from China's President Xi Jinping and endorsing China's use of Muslim prison camps. The Trump administration attempted to block the book's release, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Reactions to the book have been mixed, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals arguing he put personal profit over the country's interests. Despite Bolton's motives, some argue the book could still be impactful, while others believe it will have little effect on the upcoming election. House Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
