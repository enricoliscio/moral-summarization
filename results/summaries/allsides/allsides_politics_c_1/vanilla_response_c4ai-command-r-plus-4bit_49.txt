SUMMARY: Former National Security Advisor John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, including claims that he asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping and endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims. Trump has dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies," and the administration has taken legal action to block its release over classified information claims. Bolton's book has prompted strong reactions across the political spectrum, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals arguing he put personal profit over the country's interests. Despite Bolton's motives, some argue the book could still be impactful, while others believe it will have little effect on the upcoming election. House Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
