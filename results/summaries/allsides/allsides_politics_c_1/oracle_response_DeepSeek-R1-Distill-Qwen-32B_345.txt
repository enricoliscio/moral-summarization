Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The article is about John Bolton's book, which accuses Trump of various wrongdoings, including seeking election help from China, supporting China's policies against Muslims, and mishandling Ukraine, which was part of the impeachment. Trump and his administration are fighting the book's release, claiming it contains classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Democrats didn't subpoena Bolton during impeachment, fearing a legal battle, and Republicans in the Senate also didn't call him. The debate is about whether the book's release now is impactful or if it's too late, given the current crises. The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: decisions, speaking, executing, lies, made, wrongdoing, crisis, justice, refused, voted, let.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Bolton's book, the accusations, Trump's response, legal actions, and the political reactions. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words where they fit naturally. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll structure it to cover the accusations, the administration's response, the legal ruling, the political parties' actions, and the ongoing debate about the book's impact. I'll ensure that each point includes the moral terms without forcing them. Finally, I'll end with the upcoming release and the implications for Trump and the senators. 

I should check that each sentence flows logically and that the moral framing is evident. For example, using "executing" as in "executing journalists" and "wrongdoing" when referring to Trump's actions. I'll also include "crisis" and "justice" to maintain the moral tone. The summary should reflect the author's perspective on the moral implications of the events, such as how the book could impact Trump's reputation and the senators' decisions. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, speaking about executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine, which led to the impeachment inquiry. Trump called the book a "compilation of lies" and the administration tried to block its release, claiming it contains classified information, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Democrats and Republicans declined to subpoena Bolton during the impeachment process, citing potential legal battles. The book's release has sparked debate, with some arguing it could still impact Trump's image, especially regarding his conciliatory approach to China, while others claim it is less relevant amid the current health crisis and racial justice movement. The book, scheduled for release on June 23, includes allegations of wrongdoing that could resonate with voters discontent with Trump's pandemic and protest handling. Some argue that Republican senators who refused to hear Bolton's testimony and voted to acquit Trump during impeachment will face deserved consequences from the book's revelations. END OF SUMMARY.
