SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of consistently making decisions based on his reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Bolton portrays Trump as unfit for the presidency, and a federal judge has ruled in his favor, allowing the book's release. Trump has called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a former staffer seeking revenge. Democrats argue that Bolton's claims could have been impactful during the impeachment trial, but instead, he put personal profit over the country's interest by sharing them in a book. The accusations may still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests, potentially hurting Republican senators seeking reelection. Bolton's book is scheduled for release on June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking his testimony.

END OF SUMMARY.
