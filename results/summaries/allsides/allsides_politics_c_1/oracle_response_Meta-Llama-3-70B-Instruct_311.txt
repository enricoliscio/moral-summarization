SUMMARY:

John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on his reelection chances rather than what's in the best interest of the country. The book alleges that Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made-up stories" from a former staffer who was "just trying to get even" for being fired. The Trump administration attempted to block the book's release, claiming it contained classified information, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Democrats argue that Bolton's accusations could have been impactful during the impeachment trial, but instead, he chose to share them in a book, putting personal profit over the country's interest. The revelations may still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and protests, potentially undercutting his attempts to sell himself as a strong adversary to Beijing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
