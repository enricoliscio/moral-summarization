SUMMARY: Former National Security Advisor John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, including claims that he sought reelection help from Chinese President Xi Jinping and endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims. The Trump administration has attempted to block the book's release over classified information concerns, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Reactions to the book have been mixed, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals arguing he put personal profit over the country's interests by not sharing his claims publicly earlier. Some argue the book could still be impactful, while others believe it is now largely irrelevant due to the timing of its release. House Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
