SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and making decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump has dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a fired staffer seeking revenge. The Trump administration attempted to block the book's release, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book's revelations have sparked debate, with some arguing that Bolton should have shared his claims publicly during the impeachment trial, rather than profiting from a book. Others believe the allegations could still resonate with voters critical of Trump's handling of the pandemic and protests. The book's release is scheduled for June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations.
