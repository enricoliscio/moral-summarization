Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about John Bolton's upcoming book, which contains several accusations against President Trump. The key points I notice are that Bolton accuses Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, talking about executing journalists, and dealing with Ukraine, which was part of the impeachment. Trump and his administration are dismissing the book as lies and even tried to block its release, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. 

I should also note that Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser and left in 2019. During the impeachment, Democrats didn't subpoena him, and Republicans didn't seek his testimony either. Now, there's debate about whether his book will impact the political landscape, especially regarding Trump's reelection and the ongoing issues like the pandemic and racial justice. Some think it's timely, others think it's too late. The summary needs to capture all these elements concisely, under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Bolton's book and the accusations, then mention Trump's response and legal actions. Next, I'll cover the political reactions and debates, including the timing of the book's release and its potential impact. Finally, I'll touch on the perspectives from different commentators. I need to make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, discussing executing journalists, and engaging in Ukraine dealings that led to impeachment. Trump dismisses the book as lies, and his administration attempted to block its release over classified information claims, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton, who served from 2018 to 2019, was not subpoenaed during the impeachment inquiry. The book's release on June 23 has sparked debate, with critics arguing it could have been more impactful during the impeachment trial. Some believe the allegations, especially about Trump's conciliatory approach to China, could still damage his image amid the pandemic and racial justice protests. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. Critics argue the book may not change the political landscape significantly but could harm Trump's reelection efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
