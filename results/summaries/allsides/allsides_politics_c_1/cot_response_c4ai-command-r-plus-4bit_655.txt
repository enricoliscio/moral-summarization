SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains a series of *scathing accusations* against President Trump, painting him as *unfit* for office and alleging that he consistently put his own interests above those of the country. Bolton claims that Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and even spoke about executing journalists. Perhaps most damningly, Bolton provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine that were at the center of the impeachment saga.

The book has prompted strong reactions across the political spectrum. Trump and his allies have dismissed Bolton's claims, calling them *lies* and *self-serving* attempts at personal profit. Liberals have also criticized Bolton for not sharing his story months ago, arguing that his testimony could have been *damaging* during the impeachment trial. However, some argue that the book could still be *injurious* to Trump, particularly given the current health crisis and national movement for racial justice. The book also contains allegations of Trump's *conciliatory* approach to China, which could undercut his attempts to portray himself as a strong adversary to Beijing. 

As the book's release date of June 23 approaches, House Democrats are considering whether to seek testimony from Bolton in light of these new *accusations*.
