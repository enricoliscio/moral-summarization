SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency. Bolton claims Trump made decisions based on his reelection chances rather than the best interest of the country. The book includes accusations of Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and speaking about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made-up stories" from a former staffer who was "just trying to get even" for being fired. Despite Bolton's self-serving motives, the accusations are significant and could still be impactful, particularly with voters already discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton in light of the new allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
