Alright, I need to summarize this article about John Bolton's book and its impact. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article talks about Bolton's upcoming book, which criticizes Trump heavily. It mentions specific accusations like asking China for election help, endorsing prison camps, and Ukraine dealings. Trump and his administration are reacting by calling the book lies and taking legal action, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. 

I should note that Bolton was Trump's third national security adviser, and he left under unclear circumstances. During impeachment, neither Democrats nor Republicans subpoenaed him, possibly to avoid legal battles. 

The debate is about the book's impact. Trump's allies dismiss it, while liberals criticize Bolton for using the book for personal gain instead of going public earlier. Some think the timing is bad, others believe it's still impactful, especially regarding China. 

Looking ahead, the book is set to release on June 23, and Democrats might seek Bolton's testimony again. Perspectives include how it affects Republican senators and the significance of the allegations despite Bolton's motives.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Bolton's accusations, Trump's response, the legal battle, the political reactions, and the potential implications. Make sure to mention the release date and the possible future actions by Democrats. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY:  
John Bolton's upcoming book contains harsh criticisms of President Trump, accusing him of prioritizing reelection over national interests, seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, discussing journalist executions, and mishandling Ukraine affairs. Trump dismissed the book as "lies" from a former staffer seeking revenge, while the administration attempted to block its release over classified information claims. A federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton, Trump's third national security adviser, left the administration in 2019 amid policy disputes. Neither House Democrats nor Senate Republicans subpoenaed Bolton during the impeachment inquiry, fearing legal battles. The book's release has sparked debate, with Trump allies dismissing it and liberals criticizing Bolton for using his claims to sell a book rather than going public earlier. Some argue the timing undercuts its impact, while others believe it could still damage Trump politically, especially regarding his China policy. The book is set to release on June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. Perspectives vary on whether the accusations would have influenced the impeachment trial or the 2020 election.  
END OF SUMMARY.
