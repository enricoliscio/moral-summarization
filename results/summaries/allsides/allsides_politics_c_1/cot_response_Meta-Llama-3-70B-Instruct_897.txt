SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as a man unfit for the presidency who consistently made decisions based on how they could help his reelection chances rather than what was in the best interest of the country. Bolton's claims, though deemed self-serving by some, are significant and could still resonate with voters who are already discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. The accusations include Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and speaking about executing journalists. Democrats argue that Bolton's testimony could have been especially impactful during the impeachment trial, but instead, he chose to profit from his claims by writing a book. END OF SUMMARY.
