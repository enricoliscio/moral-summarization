SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and consistently making decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump has dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a fired staffer seeking revenge. Despite this, a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor, allowing the book's release. The accusations have sparked debate, with some arguing Bolton should have shared his claims during the impeachment trial, potentially doing severe political damage to Trump. Others believe the book could still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and racial justice movement. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations.
