Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user has specified that they want a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and they want it after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." token.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about John Bolton's upcoming book where he accuses President Trump of various misdeeds. Key points include Trump seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, discussing executing journalists, and the Ukraine dealings that led to impeachment. Trump and his administration are fighting the book's release, claiming it has classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The political reactions are mixed, with some arguing the book's timing is bad, others thinking it's still impactful.

I need to condense all this into a summary. I should start by mentioning Bolton's book and its contents. Then, note Trump's response and the legal battle. Next, the political debate: some say the timing is bad, others think it's still significant. Also, mention that Democrats might call Bolton for testimony. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

Let me structure it: introduce Bolton's book, list the accusations, Trump's denial and legal action, the political reactions, and the implications for the future. Make sure to keep each point brief.

I should also check that I'm not including any unnecessary details. For example, the specific number of words isn't crucial, but the nature of the accusations is. Also, the fact that Bolton was Trump's third NSC advisor is relevant but maybe not crucial for the summary.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, connecting each main point logically. I'll start with the book's accusations, then Trump's response, the legal ruling, the political debate, and end with the potential implications and what's next.

I should also make sure to use concise language and avoid any markdown or formatting as per the user's request. The summary should be clear and informative, capturing all key aspects without being too lengthy.

Finally, I'll wrap it up with the required tokens. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China’s treatment of Muslims, discussing executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine affairs. Trump dismisses the book as lies and legal action was taken to block its release, but a federal judge ruled in Bolton’s favor. The book, set for release on June 23, has sparked political debate, with some arguing its timing undermines its impact during a health crisis and racial justice movement, while others believe it could still damage Trump’s image. Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton for testimony, while Republicans have distanced themselves from his claims. The book’s revelations could affect Trump’s reelection efforts, particularly his portrayal of China policy. END OF SUMMARY.
