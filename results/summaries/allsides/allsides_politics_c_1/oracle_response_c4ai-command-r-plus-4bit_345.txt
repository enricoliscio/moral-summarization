SUMMARY: John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, claiming he is unfit for office and made decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. Bolton alleges Trump sought election help from China's Xi Jinping, endorsed Muslim prison camps, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "lies," while the administration tried to block its release, claiming classified information. Bolton's claims of Trump's wrongdoing may impact voters already critical of Trump's handling of crises and justice issues. The book reveals severe violations and Trump's conciliatory approach to China, contradicting his self-portrayal as a strong adversary. Despite Bolton's self-serving actions, the accusations are significant. However, some argue they wouldn't have changed the impeachment saga, as Republicans refused to vote for impeachment regardless of the evidence. The impact of Bolton's claims remains to be seen, but they add to the growing list of concerns about Trump's fitness for office.
END OF SUMMARY.
