SUMMARY: John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for office and alleging he made decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. Bolton claims Trump sought election help from China's Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump dismissed the book as "lies," and the administration tried to block its release, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton's claims have sparked debate, with critics arguing he prioritized personal profit over the country's interest by selling the book instead of sharing his knowledge during the impeachment inquiry. Others say the accusations are significant, despite Bolton's self-serving actions. The book's release is set for June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. The revelations may impact Republican senators seeking reelection and Trump's attempts to portray himself as a strong adversary to China.
