SUMMARY: John Bolton, former national security advisor, has written a book containing scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for office. Bolton alleges that Trump made decisions based on personal gain and reelection chances rather than the country's best interests, including seeking election help from China's President Xi Jinping and endorsing their use of Muslim prison camps. The book also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which was the focus of the impeachment saga. Trump dismissed the book as "lies and made-up stories," while the administration attempted to block its release over classified information claims. However, a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton's claims have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals accusing him of putting personal profit first. Despite Bolton's motives, some argue the book could still impact voters, especially with Trump's handling of the coronavirus and protests. The book's release is scheduled for June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. The revelations have prompted debate over their potential impact on Republican senators seeking reelection and the overall impeachment saga.
END OF SUMMARY.
