Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about John Bolton's book where he accuses Trump of various wrongdoings, including seeking election help from China, supporting China's treatment of Muslims, talking about executing journalists, and dealings with Ukraine. Trump and his administration are fighting the book's release, claiming it contains classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. 

The user mentioned that the summary should include as many morally framed words as possible. The words listed are executing, lies, ruled, resigned, put, sharing, wrongdoing, justice, violations, suffer, refused, voted, acquit. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to cover the key points: Bolton's accusations, Trump's response, legal actions, the judge's ruling, Bolton's tenure, and the political reactions. I'll need to mention that Democrats and Republicans have different takes on the book's timing and impact.

I should also highlight the moral implications, like Trump's unfit presidency, lying, and the justice angle. The book's release and its potential impact on the election and justice issues are important. I'll make sure to include words like "executing," "lies," "wrongdoing," "violations," "suffer," "refused," "voted," "acquit," etc., to maintain the moral framing.

Let me draft a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Bolton's book and its contents, then Trump's response, the legal battle, the judge's decision, and the political reactions. I'll include the moral words where they fit naturally.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all the essential points without being too detailed. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of unfit leadership, prioritizing reelection over national interests, and committing wrongdoing, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China’s treatment of Muslims, discussing executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine. Trump dismisses the book as "lies" and "made-up stories," while the administration tried to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton’s favor, allowing the book to proceed. Bolton, who either resigned or was fired in 2019, faced criticism from both sides: liberals accused him of prioritizing personal profit over sharing his claims publicly, while conservatives argued his testimony wouldn’t have changed the impeachment outcome. The book’s release, scheduled for June 23, could still impact Trump’s image, especially regarding his handling of China. Democrats consider seeking Bolton’s testimony, while Republicans face backlash for refusing to hear his account during impeachment. The accusations may harm reelection chances for GOP senators who voted to acquit Trump, despite Bolton’s self-serving motives. END OF SUMMARY.
