SUMMARY: John Bolton, former national security adviser, has written a book containing scathing accusations against President Trump, claiming he is unfit for office and makes decisions based on reelection chances, not the country's best interests. Bolton alleges Trump sought election help from China's President Xi Jinping and endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims. The book also includes a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which was central to the impeachment inquiry. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies" and the administration tried to block its release over classified information claims, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton's claims have sparked debate, with critics arguing he put personal profit over country by selling the book instead of sharing his knowledge months ago during the impeachment trial. Others say the accusations are significant and could still impact Trump's reelection chances, especially with voters already discontent with his handling of the coronavirus and protests. The book's release on June 23 has prompted House Democrats to consider seeking Bolton's testimony. While some argue that Bolton's testimony would not have changed the impeachment saga, others believe his allegations of severe violations and wrongdoing by the president are important and could resonate with voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
