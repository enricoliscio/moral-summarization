SUMMARY: Former national security advisor John Bolton has released a book containing scathing accusations against President Trump, claiming he is unfit for office and makes decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. Bolton reveals Trump asked for election help from China's president, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. The book also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which was central to the impeachment saga. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies," while his administration tried to block its release, claiming classified information. Bolton's claims are significant, and some argue they should have been shared publicly earlier. House Democrats are considering seeking his testimony. The book portrays Trump's wrongdoing and may impact Republican senators seeking reelection, but others argue it is self-serving and comes too late to make a difference. Bolton's actions, including his refusal to testify during the impeachment inquiry, have been criticized by both liberals and conservatives.
