Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about John Bolton's upcoming book, which accuses President Trump of various misconducts. I need to capture the main points without getting too bogged down in details.

First, I'll note that Bolton's book is set to be released on June 23. It includes serious accusations like Trump seeking election help from China, endorsing China's treatment of Muslims, talking about executing journalists, and the Ukraine dealings that led to impeachment. Trump is dismissing the book as lies and suing to block its release, but a judge ruled against him.

Then, I should mention Bolton's backgroundâ€”he was Trump's third national security adviser and left in 2019. Also, during the impeachment, neither Democrats nor Republicans subpoenaed him, which is an important point.

The article discusses the reactions: Trump's allies dismissing the claims, liberals criticizing Bolton for not coming forward earlier. Democrats think the book could still impact the election, especially regarding Trump's China policies. Some argue it might not change much because of the current political climate.

Finally, the perspectives from different commentators are included, but I need to keep the summary concise. I'll make sure to include the key accusations, the legal battle, the political reactions, and the potential impact of the book.

I should structure this into a clear, concise summary under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Make sure to include all the essential points without extra fluff.
