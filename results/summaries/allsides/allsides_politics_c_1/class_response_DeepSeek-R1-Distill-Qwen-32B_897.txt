Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral elements involved.

The article discusses John Bolton's upcoming book, which contains several accusations against President Trump. The morally charged words used include "executing," "lies," "ruled," "resigned," "put," "sharing," "wrongdoing," "justice," "violations," "suffer," "refused," "voted," and "acquit." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll outline the key points: Bolton's book accuses Trump of various wrongdoings, Trump and his administration are countering these claims, the book's release was legally challenged but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor, and the political implications of the book's timing and content.

I should structure the summary to include all these points while weaving in the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning the book's accusations, then Trump's response, the legal battle, the political reactions, and the potential impact of the book.

I need to ensure that each morally framed word is appropriately placed to reflect the original article's tone. For example, using "executing" in the context of Trump's threats, "wrongdoing" for the allegations, and "justice" regarding the impeachment context.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the overall narrative without unnecessary details. Finally, I'll end the summary with the specified tokens to indicate the conclusion.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of numerous wrongdoings, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China’s treatment of Muslims, and discussing executing journalists. Trump has called the book a compilation of lies and lies, while his administration tried to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton’s favor, allowing the book to be published on June 23. Bolton, who resigned or was fired in 2019, has faced criticism from both sides: liberals accuse him of putting personal profit over national interest by selling his story now, while conservatives argue his claims could have severely damaged Trump during the impeachment trial. The book’s timing, amid a health crisis and racial justice protests, has sparked debate over its relevance. Some argue it could still impact Trump’s image, especially his approach to China. Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton for testimony, while Republicans face backlash for refusing to hear his account during impeachment. The book’s allegations of violations and wrongdoing could harm Republican senators seeking reelection, as they previously voted to acquit Trump despite lacking evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
