Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about John Bolton's book and the reactions to it. The user provided the text and the morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Bolton's book accuses Trump of making decisions based on reelection, includes specific allegations like seeking election help from China, endorsing prison camps, talking about executing journalists, and the Ukraine dealings. Trump and his administration are dismissing it as lies, and there were legal actions to block the book, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book is set to release on June 23, and there's debate about its impact on the impeachment and current political climate.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: decisions, speaking, executing, lies, made, wrongdoing, crisis, justice, refused, voted, let. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll structure the summary to include the key accusations, Trump's response, the legal battle, and the political implications. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate, like "decisions," "executing," "lies," "wrongdoing," etc.

I'll also note the reactions from both parties and the potential impact of the book's release. The summary should reflect the moral judgments present in the original article, such as the accusations of wrongdoing and the crisis context.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure the summary is concise, includes the morally framed words, and captures the essence of the article's arguments and debates.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton’s upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on reelection rather than national interest, including seeking election help from China, endorsing prison camps for Muslims, speaking about executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine affairs. Trump dismisses the book as a "compilation of lies," while the administration attempted to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton’s favor, allowing the book to be published on June 23. Bolton, who clashed with Trump over foreign policy, was either fired or resigned in 2019. During the impeachment inquiry, neither Democrats nor Republicans subpoenaed Bolton as a witness. The book’s release has sparked debate, with critics arguing Bolton prioritized personal profit over public interest. Some argue the accusations could still impact Trump’s image, especially regarding his conciliatory approach to China, while others claim the timing undermines their relevance. The book’s claims may hurt Republican senators seeking reelection, as they refused to hear Bolton’s testimony during the impeachment trial. Despite Bolton’s motives, the allegations of wrongdoing could resonate with voters dissatisfied with Trump’s handling of the crisis and racial justice movement. END OF SUMMARY.
