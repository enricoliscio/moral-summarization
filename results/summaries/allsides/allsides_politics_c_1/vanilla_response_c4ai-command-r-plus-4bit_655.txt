SUMMARY: Former National Security Advisor John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, including claims that he sought reelection help from Chinese President Xi Jinping and endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims. The book also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine that were central to the impeachment inquiry. Trump dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies," while the administration took legal action to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. Bolton's claims have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and Democrats arguing that his testimony could have been impactful during the impeachment trial. Some argue that the book could still be politically damaging to Trump, while others believe it is largely irrelevant given the current health crisis and national movement for racial justice. House Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
