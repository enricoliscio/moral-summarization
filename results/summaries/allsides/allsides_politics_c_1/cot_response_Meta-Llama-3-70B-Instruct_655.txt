SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as a man unfit for the presidency who consistently made selfish decisions based on how they could help his reelection chances rather than what was in the best interest of the country. Bolton's claims include Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and speaking about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a former staffer who was "just trying to get even" for being fired. Democrats argue that Bolton's testimony could have been especially impactful during the impeachment trial, but instead, he chose to profit from his claims by selling a book. The book's release has sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with some arguing that the revelations are still significant and could resonate with voters who are already discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests.
