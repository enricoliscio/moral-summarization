SUMMARY: John Bolton, former national security adviser, has written a book containing scathing accusations against President Trump, claiming he is unfit for office. Bolton alleges Trump made decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest, including asking for election help from China's president, Xi Jinping, and endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims. He also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which was the center of the impeachment saga. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies," and the administration attempted to block its release, claiming classified information. Bolton's accusations have sparked debate, with Trump's allies criticizing Bolton and liberals arguing he put personal profit over country by releasing the book instead of sharing his claims publicly earlier. Despite Bolton's motives, some argue the book could be impactful, revealing severe wrongdoing by the president. The book is scheduled for release on June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony. The revelations raise questions about Republican senators' refusal to hear Bolton's testimony during impeachment and their decision to acquit Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
