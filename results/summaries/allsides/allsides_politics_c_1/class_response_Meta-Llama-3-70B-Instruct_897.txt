SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency and consistently making decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Bolton's claims could have been impactful during the impeachment trial, but Democrats argue that he put personal profit over the country's interest by sharing them now. Trump's allies have been quick to dismiss the claims as "lies" and "made-up stories." A federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor, allowing the book's release. The accusations could still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the pandemic and protests, potentially causing Republican senators to suffer in their reelection bids. END OF SUMMARY.
