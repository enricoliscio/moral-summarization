SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of consistently making decisions based on his reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. Bolton portrays Trump as unfit for the presidency, alleging that he asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a fired staffer seeking revenge. Despite the Trump administration's attempts to block its release, a federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor. The book's revelations have sparked strong reactions, with some arguing that Bolton put personal profit over the country's interest by sharing his claims now rather than during the impeachment trial. Others believe the allegations of severe violations and wrongdoing could still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the pandemic and protests. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations.
