SUMMARY: A book written by former National Security Advisor John Bolton contains a litany of explosive accusations against President Trump, including seeking reelection help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China's use of Muslim prison camps, and speaking about executing journalists. The book also provides a firsthand account of Trump's dealings with Ukraine that were central to the impeachment inquiry. Trump has dismissed the book as "a compilation of lies" and the administration has taken legal action to block its release, claiming it contains classified information. Bolton's motivations have been questioned, with critics arguing he put personal profit over the country's interests by releasing the book instead of sharing his knowledge months ago during the impeachment trial. However, others argue that the accusations are significant and could still impact Trump's reelection chances, particularly with voters already discontent with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. Bolton's claims about Trump's approach to China could also undercut the president's attempts to portray himself as a strong adversary of Beijing. The book is set for release on June 23, and Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations.
