Okay, I need to summarize this news article about John Bolton's book and the reactions to it. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Bolton's upcoming book contains several accusations against Trump. These include Trump seeking election help from China, endorsing China's prison camps, talking about executing journalists, and his dealings with Ukraine which were part of the impeachment. Trump and his administration are dismissing the book as lies and took legal action to block its release, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor.

Next, it's important to note Bolton's background: he was Trump's third national security adviser, serving from April 2018 to September 2019, when he either resigned or was fired. During the impeachment inquiry, neither House Democrats nor Senate Republicans subpoenaed him, possibly due to legal battles or other reasons.

The article also discusses the debate around the book. Trump's allies are criticizing Bolton, while liberals argue he should have shared his information publicly instead of writing a book for personal gain. Some believe the book's timing makes it less impactful, but others think it could still affect Trump's image, especially regarding China.

Looking ahead, the book is set to be released on June 23, and House Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton again. The perspectives include that the book could hurt Republican senators who acquitted Trump, and while Bolton's motives are self-serving, the details are significant. Some argue that the book wouldn't have changed the impeachment outcome because the legal arguments would still apply.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words, covering the main points: Bolton's accusations, Trump's response, the legal battle, Bolton's tenure, the political reactions, and the implications of the book's release.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Bolton and his book, then outline the accusations, Trump's dismissal, the legal ruling, and the political responses from both sides. Then mention the potential impact of the book's release and the perspectives on its significance.

I need to ensure clarity and brevity, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, the summary should end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing China's Muslim prison camps, discussing executing journalists, and mishandling Ukraine affairs. Trump dismissed the book as lies, and the administration attempted to block its release, though a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. Bolton served from 2018 to 2019, and neither Democrats nor Republicans subpoenaed him during impeachment. Critics argue the book's timing diminishes its impact, while others believe it could still harm Trump's image, especially regarding China. The book's release on June 23 may prompt further scrutiny, with Democrats considering subpoenaing Bolton again. Perspectives vary: some see the book as damaging for Republicans who acquitted Trump, while others argue it wouldn't change the impeachment outcome due to legal defenses. END OF SUMMARY.
