SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of making decisions based on personal gain rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Bolton portrays Trump as unfit for the presidency, and his claims have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum. Trump's allies have been quick to dismiss the book as "a compilation of lies and made up stories," while Democrats argue that Bolton's testimony could have been impactful during the impeachment trial, but instead chose to profit from the book. The accusations could still resonate with voters discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and protests. Bolton's claims may undercut Trump's attempts to sell himself as a strong adversary to Beijing. The book's release has sparked debate, with some arguing it could still be impactful, while others see it as too little, too late.

END OF SUMMARY.
