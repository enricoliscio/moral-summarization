SUMMARY:

John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of being unfit for the presidency, making decisions based on reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The book alleges Trump asked China's President Xi Jinping for election help, endorsed China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and spoke about executing journalists. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" from a fired staffer seeking revenge. A federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor, allowing the book's release. The accusations have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with some criticizing Bolton for prioritizing profit over the country's interest by not sharing his claims during the impeachment trial. Others argue the book's allegations of severe violations by the president could still resonate with voters. Democrats are considering seeking Bolton's testimony in light of the new allegations.
