SUMMARY:
Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency. Bolton claims Trump made decisions based on his reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. The accusations include Trump asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping and endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims. Trump called the book "a compilation of lies and made-up stories" from a former staffer who was "just trying to get even" for being fired. Despite Bolton's self-serving actions, the accusations are significant and could still be impactful, resonating with voters who are already discontent with Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests. Democrats are considering seeking testimony from Bolton, and his book is scheduled for release on June 23. END OF SUMMARY.
