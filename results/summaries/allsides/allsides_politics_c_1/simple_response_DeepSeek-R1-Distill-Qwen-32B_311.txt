Okay, I need to summarize the given news article, preserving the moral framing. The article is about John Bolton's book and its implications. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Bolton's book contains accusations against Trump, including seeking election help from China, endorsing prison camps, and actions related to Ukraine. Trump dismisses the book as lies, and the administration tried to block its release due to classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor.

I should note the political reactions: Trump's allies criticizing Bolton, liberals criticizing him for using the book for personal gain instead of testifying during impeachment. The timing of the book's release is also a point of debate, with some saying it's less impactful now.

Additionally, the perspectives from different commentators are important. Jennifer Rubin says Republican senators will be hurt by the book, Susan Glasser emphasizes the significance despite Bolton's motives, and Ramesh Ponnuru argues the claims wouldn't change the impeachment outcome.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I should highlight the accusations, the reactions, and the differing viewpoints on the book's impact.

I'll structure it by first introducing Bolton's book and its contents, then Trump's response, followed by the political reactions, and finally the perspectives on the book's significance.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too detailed. Also, preserving the moral framing means emphasizing how each side views the situationâ€”Trump's allies dismissing it, liberals criticizing Bolton's motives, and the commentators' differing opinions on the book's impact.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all these elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: John Bolton's upcoming book accuses President Trump of prioritizing reelection over national interests, including seeking election help from China, endorsing Muslim prison camps, and mishandling Ukraine. Trump dismisses the book as lies, and his administration tried to block its release over classified info, but a judge ruled in Bolton's favor. While Trump's allies criticize Bolton, liberals argue he should have testified during impeachment instead of using his claims to sell a book. The book's timing, amid a health crisis and racial justice protests, is seen by some as less impactful, though others believe it could still damage Trump's image, especially regarding his approach to China. Democrats are considering subpoenaing Bolton for testimony. Commentators debate the book's significance: some say it hurts Republicans who acquitted Trump, others argue it's self-serving but still important, while some maintain it wouldn't change the impeachment outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
