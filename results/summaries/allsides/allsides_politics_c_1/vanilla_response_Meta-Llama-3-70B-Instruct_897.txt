SUMMARY:

Former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book contains scathing accusations against President Trump, portraying him as unfit for the presidency. The book alleges that Trump made decisions based on his reelection chances rather than the country's best interest. Accusations include asking for election help from Chinese President Xi Jinping, endorsing China's use of prison camps for Muslims, and speaking about executing journalists. Trump has called the book "a compilation of lies and made up stories" and the Trump administration attempted to block its release over claims of classified information. A federal judge ruled in Bolton's favor, allowing the book's release. The book's claims have sparked strong reactions across the political spectrum, with some arguing that Bolton's testimony could have been impactful during the impeachment trial, while others say the revelations are now largely irrelevant. The book is scheduled for release on June 23.
