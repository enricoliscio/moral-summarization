SUMMARY:

The article highlights President Trump's grandiose behavior, exemplified by his tendency to use the term "treason" loosely and inaccurately. Trump has used the word to describe political opponents, including Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe. This misuse of the term is anachronistic and echoes the way monarchs used it in centuries past to justify executing political opponents. Trump's understanding of treason is "woefully inaccurate" and "disturbing," according to a law professor. The article suggests that Trump's behavior is a threat to democratic norms and the rule of law, as he confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself.

END OF SUMMARY.
