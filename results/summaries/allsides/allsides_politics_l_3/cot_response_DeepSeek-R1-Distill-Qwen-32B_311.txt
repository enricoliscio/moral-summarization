Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what they need.

The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the given article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They also provided a structure: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary.

First, I should go through the article and pick out the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong moral or ethical connotation. Let me read through the text again.

The article talks about Trump's grandiosity, his use of pronouns like "I," his claims about the economy, and his misuse of the term "treason." Words like "grandiosity," "indispensable," "strongest economy ever," "treason," "betrayal," "execution," "opponents," "fraud," "hoax," "impeachment," "conspiracy," "betrayal," "disturbing," "casual," "execution," and "limited" seem to carry moral weight.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll need to condense the article, focusing on Trump's misuse of "treason," the historical context, and the expert opinion.

I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use words like "grandiosity," "betrayal," "treason," "execution," "disturbing," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight how Trump misapplies the term "treason" to political opponents, contrasting it with the constitutional definition and the expert's perspective.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes the key points: Trump's self-centeredness, his misuse of "treason," the constitutional definition, examples of his tweets, and the expert's criticism. I'll keep each sentence focused and within the word limit.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I think that's all. Time to put it together.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article examines Donald Trump's grandiosity and his misuse of the term "treason," highlighting how he casts himself as the indispensable protagonist in American politics. Trump frequently uses "treason" to label political opponents, such as Democrats and impeachment investigators, despite the constitutional definition of treason as betraying the country, not disloyalty to a leader. His casual use of the term, as seen in tweets calling opponents "treasonous," echoes historical monarchies' tactics. Legal experts, like Carlton Larson, criticize Trump for conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, a dangerous anachronism that distorts the term's meaning. Trump's misuse of "treason" to delegitimize political opposition raises concerns about the erosion of constitutional safeguards against political abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
