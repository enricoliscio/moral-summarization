Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure with two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary. 

First, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "grandiosity," "indispensable," "strongest," "treason," "betrayal," "crime," "misused," "execution," "dishonesty," "betray," "fraud," "hoax," "disturbing," and "abuse." These terms are loaded with moral judgment, so I need to list them all.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should capture the essence of how Trump is misusing the term "treason" for political gain, which the author finds morally problematic.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's grandiosity, his misuse of "treason," the historical context of the term, and the expert's opinion on the misuse. This will ensure the moral framing is preserved.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll start by introducing Trump's grandiosity, move on to his use of "treason," discuss the constitutional definition, contrast it with Trump's usage, mention specific examples, and conclude with the expert's critique.

Alright, let me put this together step by step, making sure each part is clear and concise.

**STEP 1:**  
* grandiosity  
* indispensable  
* protagonist  
* strongest  
* treason  
* betrayal  
* crime  
* misused  
* execution  
* dishonesty  
* betray  
* fraud  
* hoax  
* disturbing  
* abuse  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses how Trumpâ€™s grandiosity is evident in his frequent use of the word "treason," which he misapplies to political opponents. The Constitution defines treason as a serious crime involving betrayal of the country, but Trump has weaponized the term to target those who oppose him, such as Democrats and impeachment investigators. His misuse echoes historical monarchies, where treason was used to eliminate political enemies. Experts, like Carlton Larson, criticize Trump for conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, a dangerous distortion of the term. His casual use of "treason" to label political adversaries as traitors is deeply disturbing and undermines the constitutional definition of the crime. END OF SUMMARY.
