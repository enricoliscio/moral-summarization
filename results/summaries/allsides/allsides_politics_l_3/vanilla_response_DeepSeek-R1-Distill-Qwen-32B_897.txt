Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Trump's use of the word "treason." Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by talking about Trump's grandiosity, using first-person pronouns to position himself as the main character in the American story. Examples given include his statements about capturing ISIS terrorists and having the strongest economy. But the main focus is on his misuse of the term "treason."

The Constitution defines treason as levying war against the US or aiding enemies, but Trump uses it more for political opponents. He equates disloyalty to him as treason, which is different from the actual definition. The article mentions that he used the word 24 times on Twitter this year, targeting Democrats, prosecutors, Schiff, and Pelosi.

Carlton Larson, a law professor, points out that Trump is conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, similar to old English ideas where treason was against the king. This misuse is problematic because in some countries, it's used to execute political opponents, which is why the US has a strict definition.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's grandiosity and his misuse of "treason." Then explain the constitutional definition versus his usage. Include examples like the Cabinet meeting and tweets. Mention the expert's opinion and the implications.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with his grandiosity, moving to the misuse, examples, expert analysis, and the impact. Keep it concise but cover all main points without going over the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll aim for each sentence to cover a key point without unnecessary details. Make sure to highlight that his use is anachronistic and dangerous, as it blurs the line between political opposition and treason.

Alright, I think I have a clear structure. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all necessary aspects.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how President Trump frequently and inappropriately uses the term "treason," conflating disloyalty to himself with the constitutional definition of treason. The Constitution defines treason as levying war against the U.S. or aiding enemies, but Trump has weaponized the term to target political opponents, such as Democrats opposing his border policies, Mueller prosecutors, and Rep. Adam Schiff during the impeachment probe. He has used the word 24 times this year on Twitter, labeling opponents as "treasonous" for actions like questioning his Ukraine call. Legal expert Carlton Larson notes Trump's misuse equates disloyalty to himself with treason, echoing outdated monarchical concepts. This casual use of the term is unprecedented and problematic, as it risks conflating political opposition with a serious crime, potentially misusing it to target political foes. END OF SUMMARY.
