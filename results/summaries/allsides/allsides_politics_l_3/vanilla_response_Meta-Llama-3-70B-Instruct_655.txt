SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity and self-conception manifest in his language, particularly in his use of the word "treason". Trump has used the term to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the US or aiding its enemies. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, targeting political opponents such as Democrats, prosecutors, and Representative Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe. Trump's use of the term is anachronistic and echoes the way monarchs used it in the past to punish political opponents. Legal experts argue that Trump's understanding of treason is "woefully inaccurate" and "disturbing", as it confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. The article suggests that Trump's misuse of the term has serious implications, as it can be used to execute political opponents in other countries.
