Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Trump's use of the word "treason" while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I should include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's grandiosity, his use of first-person pronouns, his claims about the economy, and his misuse of the term "treason." It also mentions how he's weaponizing the term against political opponents, conflating disloyalty to him with treason against the country. The author references the constitutional definition of treason and contrasts it with Trump's misuse, pointing out that he's using it anachronistically, like old monarchs.

I need to make sure to include words like "capturing," "misused," "adhering," "aid," "comfort," "passing," "espionage," "execution," "weaponizing," "treasonous," "fraud," "treason," "match," "injection," "deployed," "tossed," "execute," "definition." 

I should start by highlighting Trump's grandiosity, his use of "I" to position himself as the protagonist. Then, mention his misuse of "treason," how he's weaponizing it against opponents. Include the constitutional definition and how Trump conflates disloyalty to him with treason. Mention examples like Schiff and Pelosi, and the expert's opinion on how this misuse is disturbing and anachronistic.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll structure it to flow from Trump's grandiosity to his misuse of the term, the impact, and the expert's critique. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary step by step:

1. Start with Trump's grandiosity and self-centered narrative.
2. Mention his Cabinet meeting example where he claims to have captured ISIS.
3. Transition to his misuse of "treason," its constitutional definition vs. his use.
4. Examples of his tweets against Democrats, Schiff, Pelosi.
5. Expert opinion on the anachronistic use and confusion between loyalty to the country and loyalty to Trump.
6. Conclude with the disturbing nature of his casual misuse.

Now, I'll make sure to include the required words and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article highlights President Trump's grandiosity and his misuse of the term "treason," framing it as a moral issue. Trump positions himself as the indispensable protagonist, claiming credit for actions like "capturing" ISIS terrorists and boasting about the economy. He weaponizes "treason" to label political opponents, such as Democrats opposing his border measures and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as "treasonous." This misuse conflates disloyalty to him with betrayal of the country, echoing historical monarchs' tactics. The Constitution defines treason as levying war or aiding enemies, but Trump's usage is anachronistic, blurring the lines between loyalty to the country and loyalty to him. His casual deployment of the term, as noted by expert Carlton Larson, is disturbing and unprecedented, reflecting a dangerous conflation of political opposition with treason. END OF SUMMARY.
