Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump's misuse of the term "treason." I should start by identifying the main points.

First, Trump uses "treason" excessively, like 24 times this year on Twitter. He applies it to political opponents, like Democrats opposing his border policies and Nancy Pelosi. The article mentions that treason has a specific legal definition in the Constitution, which Trump ignores.

I should highlight how Trump conflates disloyalty to himself with betrayal of the country, which is a misuse. The expert, Carlton Larson, points out this is anachronistic, like old English concepts where treason was against the king. This misuse is dangerous because it can be used to target political enemies, as in some countries.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral critique about misusing the term for political gain. Also, mention the constitutional definition and the expert's opinion to support the moral framing.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's misuse, examples, the constitutional definition, expert's view, and the implication of equating disloyalty to the leader as treason. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article highlights President Trump's misuse of the term "treason," which has become a political tool against his opponents. Trump frequently labels political adversaries as "treasonous," including Democrats opposing his border policies and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, despite the constitutional definition of treason as a serious betrayal of the country, such as aiding enemies. Trump's usage conflates disloyalty to himself with disloyalty to the nation, echoing outdated monarchical concepts where treason was betrayal of the king. Legal expert Carlton Larson criticizes Trump for this anachronistic and dangerous misuse, noting that such casual application of the term can legitimize targeting political opponents, a practice common in authoritarian regimes. Trump's actions reflect a moral failure, as he distorts the meaning of treason to serve his personal agenda, undermining the rule of law and democratic norms. END OF SUMMARY.
