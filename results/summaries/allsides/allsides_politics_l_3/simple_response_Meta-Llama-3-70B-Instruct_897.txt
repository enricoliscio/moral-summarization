SUMMARY:

The article highlights President Trump's grandiose behavior, exemplified by his frequent use of the first-person singular pronoun, portraying himself as the central figure in the American story. He has also misused the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the United States or aiding its enemies. Trump has tweeted the word "treason" over two dozen times this year, targeting political opponents, including Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff. This misuse of the term is reminiscent of monarchs in centuries past, who used it to execute political opponents. Experts, such as Carlton Larson, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law, find Trump's understanding of treason "woefully inaccurate" and "disturbing." The article raises concerns about Trump's authoritarian tendencies and his willingness to undermine the rule of law.
