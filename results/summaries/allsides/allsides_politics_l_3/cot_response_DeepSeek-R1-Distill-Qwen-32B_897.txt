Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's use of the word "treason" and how it's a misuse of the term, which has serious implications.

The user has specified two main tasks. The first is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "grandiosity," "indispensable," "strongest," "extreme," "betrayal," "misuse," "weaponizing," "treasonous," "fraud," "execution," "disturbing," and "betrayal" come to mind. These words are used to convey moral judgments about Trump's actions.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should capture the essence of the article, highlighting Trump's misuse of "treason" and the implications of that misuse. I should make sure to mention how he equates disloyalty to himself with treason, the historical context of the term, and the expert opinion on the matter.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 listing the morally framed words and then the SUMMARY section. I have to remember to start the summary with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." and keep it within the word limit.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's grandiosity, moving to his misuse of "treason," the historical context, expert opinions, and the implications of his actions. This way, the moral framing is preserved, and the summary remains informative and concise.

**STEP 1:**

* indispensable  
* protagonist  
* strongest  
* extreme  
* betrayal  
* misuse  
* weaponizing  
* treasonous  
* fraud  
* execution  
* disturbing  
* betrayal  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article examines how President Trump's grandiosity is reflected in his frequent use of the term "treason," often misapplied to political opponents. Trump casts himself as the indispensable protagonist in the American story, equating disloyalty to himself with treason, a crime traditionally defined as betraying the country. His misuse of the term, which he has weaponized on Twitter, distorts its historical and legal meaning. For example, he labeled Democrats opposing his border policies as "treasonous" and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Adam Schiff of fraud and treason for their roles in the impeachment probe. Experts, like Carlton Larson, argue that Trump's casual use of the term echoes the outdated idea of treason as betrayal of a monarch, rather than the constitutional definition. His anachronistic approach risks conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, a dangerous misuse of a term meant to protect against genuine threats. END OF SUMMARY.
