SUMMARY:

Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual definition as a betrayal of one's country. He has used the word over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, weaponizing it to attack political opponents. Trump's understanding of treason is woefully inaccurate, confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past. He has accused Democrats who opposed his border measures of being "TREASONOUS", prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller of perpetrating a "Treasonous Hoax!", and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California of "Fraud & Treason" for characterizing his phone call with the Ukrainian president in a way that didn't match the rough transcript released by the White House. Trump's misuse of the term is disturbing, as it can be used to execute political opponents in many countries. His actions are a betrayal of the country, not the other way around.

END OF SUMMARY.
