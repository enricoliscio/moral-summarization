SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity is evident in his language and behavior, particularly in his use of the word "treason". Trump has used the term to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual constitutional definition of levying war against the US or aiding its enemies. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, targeting political opponents such as Democrats, prosecutors, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Experts argue that Trump's misuse of the term is disturbing and anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs used it in centuries past to execute political opponents. Trump's understanding of treason is "woefully inaccurate" and confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. The article suggests that Trump's use of the term is a manifestation of his inflated self-conception and a threat to the democratic process.
