Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Trump's misuse of the term "treason." First, I need to identify the key points. The article talks about Trump's grandiosity, his use of "I" a lot, and how he misapplies "treason" to political opponents.

I should note the morally charged words like "capturing," "misused," "treasonous," etc. The summary needs to include as many of these as possible. I also need to keep it under 200 words and structure it properly with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

I'll start by highlighting Trump's self-centered narrative, then move to his misuse of "treason," referencing the Constitution and experts' opinions. I'll mention specific examples like tweets against Democrats and Schiff. Finally, I'll conclude with the implications of his misuse, comparing it to historical contexts.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making it too verbose.

SUMMARY: The article examines how Donald Trump's grandiosity and self-centered narrative have led him to misuse the term "treason," framing it as a tool to attack political opponents rather than its constitutional definition. Trump frequently uses "treason" to label those who oppose him, such as Democrats and impeachment investigators, as disloyal. This contrasts with the constitutional definition of treason, which involves betraying the country, not just opposing a leader. Trump's misuse echoes historical practices where monarchs weaponized the term to execute political enemies. Experts, like Carlton Larson, criticize Trump for conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, a dangerous distortion of the term. His casual use of "treason" to describe political dissent, such as calling opponents "treasonous" or accusing them of "fraud and treason," reflects a disregard for the gravity of the word and its potential to delegitimize democratic processes. END OF SUMMARY.
