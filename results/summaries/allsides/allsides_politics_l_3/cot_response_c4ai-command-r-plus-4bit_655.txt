SUMMARY:
The article discusses US President Trump's misuse of the term "treason" to describe acts of disloyalty or opposition to his agenda. Trump's grandiosity and self-conception as the indispensable protagonist in the American story have led him to conflate loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country. He has used the term "treason," which is a crime of betraying one's country, to attack political opponents, such as Democratic Representative Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who are running the impeachment probe against him. Legal experts find Trump's usage of the term disturbing and inaccurate, echoing the way monarchs used it in the past to execute political opponents. Trump's casual misuse of the term, which has a limited modern definition to prevent partisan misuse, confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to the leader, a throwback to the old English idea of betrayal of the king.
