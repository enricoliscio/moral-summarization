Alright, I need to summarize this article about Trump's use of the word "treason." Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about how Trump often refers to himself as the central figure in American politics, using "I" a lot. He claims credit for various achievements, like capturing ISIS terrorists and having the strongest economy. But the main focus is on his misuse of the term "treason." 

Treason, as defined by the Constitution, is a serious crime involving betrayal against the country, like levying war or aiding enemies. However, Trump uses it differently, applying it to political opponents who oppose his policies. For example, he called Democrats opposing his border measures "treasonous" and accused the Mueller prosecutors of a "treasonous hoax." 

He also targeted Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi for their roles in the impeachment probe, even though their actions don't fit the legal definition of treason. The article mentions that this misuse is anachronistic, similar to how monarchs used the term in the past to target political enemies. An expert, Carlton Larson, points out that Trump is confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, which is a distortion of the term's meaning. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight Trump's grandiosity, his misuse of "treason," examples of who he's accused, and the expert's opinion on the issue. Also, mention that his usage is anachronistic and problematic because it conflates loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. 

Let me structure it: start with Trump's self-centered approach, mention his Cabinet comments, then discuss his misuse of treason, provide examples, explain the constitutional definition, and conclude with the expert's viewpoint and implications. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses President Trump's tendency to cast himself as the central figure in American politics, often using "I" to emphasize his role. His grandiosity is evident in his claims of achievements, such as capturing ISIS terrorists and boasting about the economy. However, the article focuses on his misuse of the term "treason," which he applies to political opponents, despite its constitutional definition as betrayal of the country. Trump has accused Democrats, prosecutors, and key figures like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi of treason, often over minor disputes. His use of the term, which equates disloyalty to him with treason, reflects an anachronistic view, similar to how monarchs used it to target political enemies. An expert, Carlton Larson, notes that Trump's understanding of treason is flawed, conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, a dangerous distortion of the term. END OF SUMMARY.
