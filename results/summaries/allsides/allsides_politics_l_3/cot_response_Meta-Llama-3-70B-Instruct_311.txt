SUMMARY:
President Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to him, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the United States or aiding its enemies. He has used the term two dozen times this year alone on Twitter, labeling Democrats who opposed his border measures as "TREASONOUS" and prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller as perpetrating a "Treasonous Hoax!" Trump's use of the word is anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past, and is "quite disturbing" according to Carlton Larson, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law. Trump's actions are a "betrayal" of the country, and his understanding of treason is "woefully inaccurate." His casual use of the term is unprecedented and has dangerous implications, as it can be used to execute political opponents in many countries. END OF SUMMARY.
