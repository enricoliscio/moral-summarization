SUMMARY:
President Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe his political opponents. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, accusing Democrats, prosecutors, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of "treason" for opposing his agenda or investigating his actions. However, his understanding of the term is "completely inaccurate" and "woefully" misguided, according to a law professor. Trump's use of the word is anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past to execute political opponents. His actions are "disturbing" and demonstrate a "betrayal" of the country's values. Trump's "anger" towards his opponents grows as he continues to "weaponize" the term, confusing "loyalty to the country" with "loyalty to Trump." END OF SUMMARY.
