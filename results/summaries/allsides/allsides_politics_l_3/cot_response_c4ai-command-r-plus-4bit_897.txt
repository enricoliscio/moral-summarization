SUMMARY:
President Trump's grandiose self-conception is on full display in his misuse of the term "treason." Treason, a grave act of betrayal against one's country, is defined in the Constitution as waging war against the US or aiding its enemies. Trump, however, confuses loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country, mirroring the old English notion of treason as a betrayal of the monarch. He casually throws around accusations of treason against political opponents, such as Representative Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who are leading the impeachment probe. Legal experts find Trump's misunderstanding of treason disturbing, as it echoes the misuse of the term by monarchs to execute their adversaries. Trump's false accusations of treason, such as calling Democrats' opposition to his border measures "treasonous," highlight his disregard for the term's true meaning and the potential consequences of his words. His behavior raises concerns about the casual use of treason accusations for partisan purposes, a practice that undermines the framers' intentions and threatens the foundations of American democracy.
