SUMMARY: Trump has a grandiose view of himself and his role in the American story, often referring to himself in the first-person singular pronoun. He has also misused the term "treason" to describe disloyalty or opposition to his agenda, equating it with betrayal of the country rather than the correct definition of levying war against the US or aiding its enemies. Trump's use of the word echoes monarchical usage and has been criticized by legal experts as inaccurate and disturbing. His casual use of the term, which has appeared two dozen times on his Twitter feed this year, reflects his anger towards political opponents and is seen as a way to execute them politically. Legal experts find Trump's misuse of the term disturbing and worry that it could be used to justify political persecution.

END OF SUMMARY.
