SUMMARY: Trump's grandiose self-conception is manifested in his misuse of the term "treason," confusing loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country. He has used the word to describe political opponents, such as Democrats who opposed his border measures and prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is in stark contrast to the Constitutional definition of treason, which involves levying war against the US or aiding its enemies. Trump's inaccurate and casual use of the term is disturbing and anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in the past to execute political opponents. Carlton Larson, an expert on treason, emphasizes the importance of a limited definition of treason to prevent its misuse for partisan purposes. Trump's characterization of treason as disloyalty to himself rather than the country is a dangerous conflation of loyalty that reflects an old English idea of betrayal of the king. His anger towards political opponents has led him to weaponize the term, with no regard for its true meaning or the serious consequences it entails.
END OF SUMMARY.
