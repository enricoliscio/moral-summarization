SUMMARY:

Trump's grandiose behavior is evident in his language, where he misuses serious terms like "treason" to describe disloyalty to him, rather than its actual meaning of betraying the country. He has used the word "treasonous" over two dozen times on Twitter this year, weaponizing it to attack political opponents. This is a disturbing trend, as treason is a serious crime that can lead to execution, and Trump's casual use of it echoes monarchs of centuries past who used it to execute political opponents. Experts like Carlton Larson, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law, condemn Trump's inaccurate understanding of treason, which confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to Trump. Trump's tweets have accused Democrats, prosecutors, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason, which is a serious misstep. His language is an attempt to deploy the term as a means to discredit and execute political opponents, rather than upholding the true definition of treason.

END OF SUMMARY.
