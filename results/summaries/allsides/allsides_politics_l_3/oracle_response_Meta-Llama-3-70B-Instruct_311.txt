SUMMARY:

Trump's grandiose behavior is evident in his language, where he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual meaning of betraying the country. He has used the term over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, weaponizing it to attack political opponents. Trump's understanding of treason is "woefully inaccurate" and "disturbing," according to expert Carlton Larson. The president's actions echo monarchs of centuries past, who used the term to execute political opponents. Trump's tweets have labeled Democrats who opposed his border measures as "TREASONOUS," and even called for Democratic Representative Adam Schiff to be questioned for "Fraud & Treason" over his characterization of Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president. This misuse of the term is an anachronism in the modern era, and its casual deployment is unprecedented among presidents.
