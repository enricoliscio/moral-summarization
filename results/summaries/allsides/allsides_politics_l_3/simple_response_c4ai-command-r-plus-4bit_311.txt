SUMMARY: President Trump has a history of grandiose behavior and self-aggrandizement, including the misuse of the term "treason" to describe actions of political opponents and critics. Trump's use of the term "treason" confuses loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country, echoing the old English idea of betrayal of the king. This is in contrast to the constitutional definition of treason as levying war against the United States or aiding its enemies. Trump's casual and inaccurate use of the term, which has historically been used to execute political opponents, is disturbing and unprecedented for a US president.

END OF SUMMARY.
