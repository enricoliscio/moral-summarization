SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the United States or aiding its enemies. He has used the word over two dozen times this year alone on Twitter, targeting political opponents such as Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe. Trump's understanding of treason is "completely inaccurate, woefully so," according to legal expert Carlton Larson, and is reminiscent of monarchs from centuries past who used the term to execute political opponents. This "disturbing" misuse of the term has no precedent in modern American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
