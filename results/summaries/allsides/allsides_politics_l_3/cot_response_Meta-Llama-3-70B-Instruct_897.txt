SUMMARY:
Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than the actual crime of betraying one's country. He has used the term over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, labeling political opponents such as Democrats and prosecutors as "treasonous". This is a disturbing and inaccurate understanding of the term, which is a serious crime that can lead to lethal injection. Trump's use of the term is anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past, where treason was seen as a betrayal of the king. Experts say Trump's misuse of the term confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, which is a woefully inaccurate understanding. This is a dangerous and disturbing trend that has no precedent in modern American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
