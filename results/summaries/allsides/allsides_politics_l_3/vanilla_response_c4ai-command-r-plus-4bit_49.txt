SUMMARY: President Trump has a history of grandiose behavior, including referring to himself in the first person and taking credit for accomplishments. Recently, Trump has been using the word "treason" to describe his political opponents, which legal experts argue is a misuse of the term. Treason is a legal term defined in the US Constitution as levying war against the US or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. Trump's use of the word reflects an outdated understanding of treason, where loyalty to a leader is equivalent to loyalty to a country. Legal scholars find this disturbing and argue that treason has historically been used to execute political opponents, which is why its definition is limited in modern times. Trump's casual use of the term, especially on Twitter, is seen as a reflection of his anger towards those who oppose him and his policies. This includes figures such as Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, who are leading the impeachment probe against Trump.
