SUMMARY: President Trump has repeatedly misused the term treason to describe actions of political opponents and critics, equating disloyalty to himself with betrayal of the country. Trump's use of the term is inconsistent with its legal definition, which is narrowly defined in the US Constitution as levying war against the US or providing aid and comfort to its enemies. Trump's misuse of the term reflects an outdated understanding of treason as primarily involving betrayal of a monarch, rather than the country as a whole. Legal experts find his usage disturbing and worry that it could undermine the seriousness of the crime. Trump's rhetoric also reflects a broader pattern of grandiose behavior, where he casts himself as the central protagonist in the American story and the only person capable of ensuring its success.

END OF SUMMARY.
