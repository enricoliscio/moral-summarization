SUMMARY: President Trump has a grandiose view of himself and his role in the American story, and this is reflected in his use of language, particularly the first-person singular pronoun. He has repeatedly accused his political opponents of treason, a crime that carries a serious penalty and is defined in the Constitution as levying war against the United States or aiding its enemies. Trump's use of the term is inaccurate and disturbing, reflecting an old English idea of betrayal of a monarch rather than loyalty to a country. His misuse of the term confuses loyalty to himself with loyalty to the nation and echoes the way monarchs used treason to execute political opponents. Trump's casual and inaccurate use of "treason" is unprecedented for a US president and undermines the careful definition established by the framers of the Constitution to prevent its partisan misuse.

END OF SUMMARY.
