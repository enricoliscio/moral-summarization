Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this article about Trump's use of the word "treason." Hmm, let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points. 

First, the article talks about Trump's grandiosity and how he uses "I" a lot, positioning himself as the main character. Then it goes into how he misuses the term "treason." I remember he used it a lot on Twitter, especially against political opponents. 

Wait, the article mentions that treason is a serious crime defined in the Constitution, but Trump is using it differently. He equates disloyalty to him with treason, which is more like the old English concept where betraying the king was treason. That's a good point to include.

Also, the professor from UC Davis, Carlton Larson, is quoted saying Trump's misuse is confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to him, which is disturbing. And he's the first president to use the term so casually. That's an important detail.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's grandiosity, then his misuse of "treason," give examples like tweets against Schiff and Pelosi, and finally include the expert opinion on how this is problematic. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me make sure I include all these points without going over the word limit. Maybe start with Trump's self-centeredness, then his misuse, examples, and the expert's take. That should cover the main ideas effectively.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses President Trump's tendency to misuse the term "treason," reflecting his grandiose self-image. Trump frequently uses "treason" to label political opponents, such as Democrats opposing his border policies or those involved in the impeachment probe, including Representative Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Historically, treason in the U.S. Constitution refers to acts like levying war against the country or aiding enemies, but Trump redefines it to mean disloyalty to him. This misuse echoes the old English concept of treason as betrayal of a monarch, not the modern legal definition. Professor Carlton Larson criticizes Trump's casual use of the term, noting it confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to the president, a dangerous conflation reminiscent of authoritarian regimes. Trump's anachronistic approach risks weaponizing the term for political gain, with little regard for its constitutional meaning.  
END OF SUMMARY.
