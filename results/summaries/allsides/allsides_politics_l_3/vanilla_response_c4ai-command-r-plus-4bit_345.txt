SUMMARY: Trump's grandiose behavior is reflected in his frequent use of the first-person pronoun, positioning himself as the central figure in the American narrative. He has also repeatedly misused the term "treason," equating disloyalty to himself with betrayal of the country. This conflation of loyalty to the country with loyalty to the leader harkens back to the English idea of treason as betrayal of the king. Trump's inaccurate understanding of treason is disturbing, as it blurs the lines between loyalty to the nation and loyalty to himself. His casual use of the term, with no regard for its true meaning, reflects a dangerous disregard for the rule of law and the checks and balances put in place by the Constitution. Trump's behavior echoes that of monarchs in centuries past, and experts warn that his misuse of the term could have dangerous implications for political opposition in the modern era.

END OF SUMMARY.
