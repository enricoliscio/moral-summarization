Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's use of the word "treason." The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Trump's grandiosity, using "I" a lot, and how he sees himself as the main character in America's story. Examples include him taking credit for capturing ISIS terrorists and claiming the strongest economy. But the main focus is on his misuse of "treason."

The author explains that treason is a serious crime with a specific legal definition, but Trump uses it loosely against political opponents. He's used it on Twitter over 20 times this year, targeting Democrats, Mueller's prosecutors, Schiff, and Pelosi. The article also mentions experts like Carlton Larson, who points out that Trump is conflating disloyalty to himself with treason, which is a betrayal of the country.

The moral issue here is that Trump is misusing a term meant for serious crimes to attack political enemies, which could set a dangerous precedent. The author is concerned about the implications for democracy and the rule of law.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, within 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's grandiosity, then his misuse of "treason," examples, the legal definition, expert opinion, and the moral concern about undermining democratic norms.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me put it all together, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity is reflected in his frequent use of the word "treason," which he misapplies to political opponents. Treason, as defined by the Constitution, involves betraying the country through acts like levying war or aiding enemies. Trump, however, uses the term to describe disloyalty to himself or opposition to his policies. For example, he labeled Democrats opposing his border measures as "TREASONOUS" and accused Rep. Adam Schiff of "Fraud & Treason" for his role in the impeachment probe. Trump's casual use of the term echoes historical monarchs' tactics, conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. Legal experts, like Carlton Larson, criticize this misuse, noting it distorts the legal definition and risks undermining democratic norms. Trump's anachronistic approach to "treason" raises concerns about its potential to weaponize a serious crime for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
