SUMMARY: Trump's grandiosity and misuse of the term "treason" reflect a dangerous confusion between loyalty to the country and loyalty to himself, harking back to the old English idea of betrayal of the king. Trump has used the word "treason" two dozen times this year on Twitter to attack political opponents, such as Democrats who opposed his border measures and prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His use of the word is inaccurate and disturbing, echoing the way monarchs in centuries past used treason to execute political opponents. Legal experts warn that Trump's casual and incorrect use of the term is quite disturbing and has no parallel in modern presidential discourse.

END OF SUMMARY.
