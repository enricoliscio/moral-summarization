SUMMARY:

The article highlights President Trump's grandiose behavior, particularly his misuse of the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself rather than the country. Trump has used the term over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, applying it to political opponents, including Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe. This usage is anachronistic and echoes the way monarchs used the term in centuries past to punish those who betrayed them. Trump's understanding of treason is "completely inaccurate" and "woefully" misguided, according to a law professor. The article raises concerns about Trump's behavior, suggesting that his misuse of the term treason is a form of authoritarianism, where loyalty to the leader is conflated with loyalty to the country.

END OF SUMMARY.
