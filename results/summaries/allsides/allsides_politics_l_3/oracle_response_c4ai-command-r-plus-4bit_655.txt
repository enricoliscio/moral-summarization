SUMMARY: President Trump's grandiose self-conception is on full display in his frequent misuse of the term "treason," a crime that the framers of the Constitution took steps to define and protect from partisan misuse. Trump's use of the word echoes the old English idea of betrayal of a monarch, confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. He has used the word to describe actions of political opponents that do not meet the constitutional definition of treason, which is levying war against the United States or "adhering to" enemies and giving them "aid and comfort." Trump's inaccurate and casual use of the term is disturbing and anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in the past to execute political opponents. His tweets have labeled as "treasonous" Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Representative Adam Schiff, who is running the impeachment probe. Trump's anger and willingness to weaponize the term "treason" against his political enemies is a dangerous departure from modern democratic norms.
END OF SUMMARY.
