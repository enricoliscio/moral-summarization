SUMMARY:

The article highlights President Trump's grandiose behavior, exemplified by his self-aggrandizing language and misuse of the term "treason". Trump has used the term to describe political opponents, including Democrats and prosecutors, as disloyal to him personally, rather than to the country. This distortion of the concept of treason is reminiscent of monarchs from centuries past, where loyalty to the king was paramount. Experts, such as law professor Carlton Larson, condemn Trump's inaccurate and disturbing use of the term, which has been used in other countries to execute political opponents. Trump's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution and the principles of democracy, prioritizing his own ego and interests over the well-being of the nation.

END OF SUMMARY.
