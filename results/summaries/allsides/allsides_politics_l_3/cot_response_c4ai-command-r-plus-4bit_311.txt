SUMMARY: President Trump's grandiosity and self-indispensability are reflected in his misuse of the term "treason," which he weaponizes against political opponents. He confuses loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country, mirroring the old English idea of betrayal of the king. Trump's inaccurate and casual use of the term, referring to acts of opposition or resistance as treason, is disturbing and reminiscent of monarchs executing political opponents for treason. His anger and focus on opponents, such as Democrats and those involved in the impeachment probe, further showcase his misuse of the term. This framing of treason as partisan betrayal is a dangerous confusion of loyalty and a distortion of the term's limited, modern definition, which is meant to protect against misuse for political purposes. Trump's rhetoric echoes a time when monarchs misused treason to execute their political opponents, and experts find his casual usage woefully inaccurate and disturbing.
