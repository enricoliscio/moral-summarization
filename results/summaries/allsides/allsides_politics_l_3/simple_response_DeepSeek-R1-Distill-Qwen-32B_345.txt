Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's use of the word "treason." The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Trump's grandiosity, using "I" a lot, and how he positions himself as the main character in America's story. Examples include him claiming credit for capturing ISIS terrorists and boasting about the economy. The main focus is on his misuse of the term "treason." The author explains that treason, under the Constitution, is a serious crime involving betrayal of the country, like espionage. But Trump uses it to label political opponents who oppose his policies, like Democrats and those involved in the Mueller probe or impeachment.

The article mentions that Trump's usage is anachronistic, similar to how monarchs used it, implying he's conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. An expert, Carlton Larson, points out that Trump's understanding is flawed and dangerous, as it's a term meant for serious betrayal, not political opposition.

I need to capture that Trump is misusing the term, the moral issue of trivializing a serious crime, and the comparison to historical misuse by monarchs. Also, the expert's opinion is crucial to highlight the inaccuracy and danger of his approach.

So, the summary should mention Trump's grandiosity, his misuse of "treason," the constitutional definition, his application to political opponents, the expert's criticism, and the moral implication of conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to him. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral framing.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's grandiosity, mention specific examples, then discuss the misuse of "treason," contrast with the constitutional definition, give examples of who he labels, mention the expert's viewpoint, and conclude with the moral issue of trivializing treason.

I should avoid jargon, keep it clear, and ensure it flows well. Make sure to highlight that Trump's use is incorrect and dangerous, as it misrepresents the actual crime and risks political persecution under the guise of treason.

Alright, putting it all together, making sure each key point is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity is reflected in his frequent use of the word "treason," which he misapplies to political opponents. Treason, as defined by the Constitution, involves betraying the country, such as espionage or aiding enemies. However, Trump has weaponized the term to label political adversaries, such as Democrats opposing his policies or those involved in the Mueller probe and impeachment inquiry. His misuse conflates loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, echoing the historical practice of monarchs. Legal expert Carlton Larson criticizes Trump for distorting the term, noting it is "completely inaccurate" and dangerous, as it trivializes a serious crime and risks political persecution. Trump's casual use of "treason" reflects a troubling conflation of personal loyalty with national betrayal, raising moral concerns about the manipulation of legal terminology for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
