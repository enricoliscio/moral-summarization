SUMMARY:

The article highlights President Trump's grandiose behavior, exemplified by his self-aggrandizing language and misuse of the term "treason". Trump has used the word to describe political opponents, including Democrats who opposed his border measures, prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment probe. This is a disturbing and inaccurate use of the term, which is defined in the Constitution as levying war against the United States or giving aid and comfort to enemies. Trump's behavior echoes the way monarchs used the term in centuries past, conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. Experts, such as Professor Carlton Larson, condemn Trump's misuse of the term, which has the potential to be used to execute political opponents in other countries. Trump's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the gravity and seriousness of the term "treason".
