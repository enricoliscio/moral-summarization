SUMMARY: Trump has a grandiose sense of self-importance, casting himself as the protagonist in the American story and misusing the term "treason" to attack his political opponents. He has used the word two dozen times this year on Twitter, including accusing Democrats who opposed his border measures and prosecutors under Special Counsel Robert Mueller of treason. Trump's use of the word is inaccurate and disturbing, confusing loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country. This is reminiscent of the old English idea of treason as betrayal of the king. Trump's anger towards political opponents, such as Representative Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has led to his casual and anachronistic use of the term, which echoes the way monarchs deployed it in the past to execute political opponents. Experts find his usage quite troubling and inaccurate.
END OF SUMMARY.
