SUMMARY: President Trump has a grandiose sense of self, casting himself as the protagonist in the American story and using the word "treason" to describe disloyalty or opposition to his agenda. He has misused the term, which is legally defined in Article III of the Constitution as levying war against the US or "adhering to" enemies and giving them "aid and comfort." Trump's use of the word echoes the old English idea of betrayal of the king, and experts find it disturbing and inaccurate. He has casually weaponized the term on Twitter, calling Democrats who opposed his border measures and prosecutors under Special Counsel Robert Mueller "treasonous." Recently, he has also accused Rep. Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of treason for their roles in the impeachment probe. Trump's misuse of "treason" is anachronistic and echoes the way monarchs deployed it in the past to execute political opponents. Experts warn that the term should not be used casually and that treason is defined more narrowly to prevent its misuse for partisan purposes.
END OF SUMMARY.
