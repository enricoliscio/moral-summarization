Okay, I need to summarize this article about Trump's use of the word "treason." The user provided a detailed news article, and I have to condense it into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's grandiosity and his frequent use of the word "treason." He often refers to his achievements and uses "treason" to attack political opponents. 

I notice that the article mentions specific examples, like his tweets accusing Democrats and Nancy Pelosi of treason. It also explains how the Constitution defines treason, which is different from how Trump uses it. The author points out that Trump conflates disloyalty to him with betrayal of the country, which is a misuse of the term.

I should highlight Trump's misuse of the word, the examples given, and the expert opinion from Professor Larson. Also, it's important to note that the Constitution has a strict definition of treason, which Trump ignores.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, sticking to the main points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's grandiosity, then his misuse of "treason," provide examples, and conclude with the expert's opinion on the issue.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all key elements. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: The article discusses President Trump's frequent and controversial use of the word "treason," highlighting his grandiose self-image and tendency to equate disloyalty to himself with betrayal of the country. Trump has weaponized the term, labeling political opponents, such as Democrats opposing his border policies and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as "treasonous." His misuse contrasts with the constitutional definition of treason, which involves acts of war or aiding enemies, not political dissent. Trump's casual deployment of the term reflects a misunderstanding, conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, akin to the old English concept of betraying the monarch. Professor Carlton Larson of UC Davis School of Law notes Trump's anachronistic and inaccurate use of the term, emphasizing its potential misuse to silence political opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
