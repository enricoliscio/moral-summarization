SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity is evident in his language and behavior, particularly in his use of the word "treason". Trump has used the term to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual meaning of betraying one's country. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, accusing political opponents, including Democrats and prosecutors, of treason. Experts argue that Trump's misuse of the term is disturbing and anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs used it in centuries past. Trump's understanding of treason is inaccurate, and his casual use of the term is unprecedented among presidents. The article suggests that Trump's language is not only divisive but also dangerous, as it can be used to justify the execution of political opponents in other countries.
