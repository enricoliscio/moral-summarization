SUMMARY: President Trump has been criticized for his misuse of the term "treason" to describe acts of disloyalty or opposition to his agenda by political opponents. Treason is a serious crime defined in the US Constitution as levying war against the country or aiding its enemies, but Trump has used it casually and inaccurately to attack those who disagree with him. This includes calling for the investigation of Representative Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for "treason" during the impeachment probe. Trump's use of the term echoes the way monarchs used it in the past to execute political opponents, and experts find it disturbing and inappropriate for a modern leader to toss the term around so casually.

END OF SUMMARY.
