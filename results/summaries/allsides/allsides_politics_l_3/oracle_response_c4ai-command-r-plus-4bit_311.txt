SUMMARY: Trump has repeatedly misused the term "treason," a crime with a specific and limited definition in the US Constitution, to attack his political opponents and characterize their actions as betrayal against himself rather than the country. He has used the word to describe a range of actions, from opposing his border measures to characterizing his phone call with the Ukrainian president inaccurately. Trump's use of "treason" echoes the old English idea of betrayal against the king, and experts find it disturbing and inaccurate. His casual tossing around of the term, which is often used to execute political opponents in other countries, undermines the careful definition intended by the framers of the Constitution. This misuse of "treason" is just one example of Trump's grandiosity and his tendency to cast himself as the indispensable protagonist in the American story.
