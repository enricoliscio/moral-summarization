Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's use of the word "treason." The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article starts by talking about Trump's grandiosity, using "I" a lot, positioning himself as the main character in the American story. Examples given include his claims about capturing ISIS and having the strongest economy. Then it moves on to his misuse of the term "treason." The Constitution defines treason as specific acts against the country, but Trump uses it for political opponents, like Democrats opposing his policies or the impeachment probe. He's used the word 24 times this year on Twitter, calling people like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi "treasonous." 

The article also mentions that Trump once knew the correct definition, referencing the Rosenbergs. However, he's now using it in a way that equates disloyalty to him as treason, which is similar to how monarchs used it in the past. An expert, Carlton Larson, points out that Trump is confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, which is a misuse of the term. This is disturbing because it blurs the line between political opposition and actual betrayal, which in some countries is used to eliminate political enemies.

So, the moral framing here is about the misuse of a serious legal term for political gain, which undermines the rule of law and democratic principles. The summary needs to highlight Trump's grandiosity, his incorrect use of "treason," the implications of this misuse, and the expert's opinion on its dangers.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these elements. Let me structure it: start with Trump's grandiosity, mention his use of "treason," explain the correct definition vs. his misuse, give examples, and conclude with the expert's concern about the implications.

SUMMARY: The article discusses President Trump's grandiosity and his misuse of the term "treason," which he has weaponized against political opponents. While the Constitution defines treason as specific acts of betrayal against the country, Trump has redefined it to target those who oppose his agenda, such as Democrats and impeachment investigators. He has used the term 24 times this year, labeling critics like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi as "treasonous." Though Trump once understood the legal definition, he now conflates disloyalty to himself with treason, echoing historical monarchs who used the term to eliminate political enemies. Legal expert Carlton Larson criticizes Trump's misuse, stating it confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to the president, a dangerous departure from the constitutional framework. This casual use of such a serious term undermines the rule of law and democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
