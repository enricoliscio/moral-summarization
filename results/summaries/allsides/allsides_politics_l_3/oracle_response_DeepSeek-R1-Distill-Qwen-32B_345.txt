Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's use of the word "treason" and how he's misusing it for political purposes. The article mentions his grandiosity, his Cabinet meetings where he talks about capturing ISIS, and his claims about the economy. 

I notice the author uses words like "capturing," "misused," "treason," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by highlighting Trump's grandiosity and his misuse of "treason." Then, I'll mention how he equates disloyalty to himself with treason, which is historically incorrect. I should include examples like tweeting about Democrats and Schiff. Also, note the professor's comment about confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to Trump.

I'll make sure to include the key points: his Cabinet comments, misuse of treason, historical context, examples of tweets, and the expert's opinion. Keeping it within the word limit is crucial, so I'll be concise but thorough.

Finally, I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with his grandiosity, then his misuse, examples, and the expert's perspective. I'll ensure all the moral words are incorporated without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Trump’s grandiosity is evident in his frequent use of the first-person pronoun and his self-portrayal as the indispensable protagonist in American history. He has misused the term "treason," conflating it with disloyalty to himself rather than the constitutional definition of betraying the country. For instance, he has labeled political opponents, including Democrats and Representative Adam Schiff, as "treasonous" for actions like opposing his border policies or characterizing his phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump’s weaponization of the term echoes historical monarchies, where treason was used to execute political opponents. Professor Carlton Larson notes that Trump’s understanding of treason is "completely inaccurate," equating it with loyalty to himself rather than the nation. This misuse distorts the legal and moral definition of treason, which is reserved for acts like levying war or aiding enemies, not political dissent. Trump’s casual deployment of the term reflects a dangerous conflation of personal loyalty with national duty. END OF SUMMARY.
