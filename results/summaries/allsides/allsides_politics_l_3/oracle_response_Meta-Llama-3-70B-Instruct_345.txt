SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's grandiosity is evident in his language, where he casts himself as the central figure in the American story. He misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to him, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the US or aiding enemies. Trump's tweets have weaponized the term, accusing Democrats, prosecutors, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of "treason" for opposing his agenda or investigating his actions. This anachronistic use of the term echoes monarchs of centuries past, confusing loyalty to the country with loyalty to Trump. Experts like Carlton Larson find Trump's understanding of treason "woefully inaccurate" and "disturbing". By tossing around the term so casually, Trump risks executing political opponents, a tactic used in many countries. His language is a betrayal of the country's values, and his actions are a fraud on the Constitution.

END OF SUMMARY.
