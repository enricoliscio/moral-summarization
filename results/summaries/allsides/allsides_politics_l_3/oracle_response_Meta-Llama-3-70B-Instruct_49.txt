SUMMARY:

Trump's grandiosity is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual meaning of betraying one's country. He has used the word over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, weaponizing it to attack political opponents. Democrats who opposed his border measures are "TREASONOUS", prosecutors working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller are perpetrating a "Treasonous Hoax!", and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff is committing "Fraud & Treason" for characterizing Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president in a way that didn't match the rough transcript. Trump's use of the word is anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs deployed it in centuries past to execute political opponents. Experts like Carlton Larson, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law, find Trump's understanding of treason to be "completely inaccurate, woefully so, and quite disturbing". Trump's actions are a betrayal of the country's values, and his misuse of the term "treason" is a dangerous and disturbing trend.

END OF SUMMARY.
