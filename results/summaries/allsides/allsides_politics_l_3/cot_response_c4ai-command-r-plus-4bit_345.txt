SUMMARY:
Trump's grandiosity is evident in his self-portrayal as the indispensable protagonist in the American story. He casually uses the term treason to describe acts of disloyalty and betrayal, confusing loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country. This disturbing trend echoes the old English idea of betrayal of the king, and experts warn that in many countries, treason is used to execute political opponents. Trump has inaccurately and casually tossed around the term, targeting political opponents such as Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, whom he accuses of fraud and treason for their roles in the impeachment probe. His misuse of the term is woefully inaccurate and anachronistic, reflecting a monarchical mindset that is out of place in modern democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
