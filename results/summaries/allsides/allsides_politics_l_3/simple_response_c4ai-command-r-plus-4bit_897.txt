SUMMARY: Trump's grandiosity and misuse of the term "treason" reflects a disturbing confusion between loyalty to the country and loyalty to himself, echoing the old English idea of betrayal of the king. Trump's inaccurate and casual use of the term, which carries a serious punishment of lethal injection, is anachronistic and reminiscent of how monarchs used it to execute political opponents. His self-aggrandizing statements, such as claiming credit for capturing Islamic State terrorists and having the strongest economy, demonstrate a self-conception that positions him as the indispensable protagonist in the American story. Trump's tweets labeling political opponents as treasonous, including Democrats who opposed his border measures and prosecutors working under Mueller, show a disregard for the true meaning of treason as defined in the Constitution. Experts find Trump's use of the term highly disturbing and a potential threat to political opponents.

END OF SUMMARY.
