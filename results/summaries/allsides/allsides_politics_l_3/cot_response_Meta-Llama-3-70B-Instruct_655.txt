SUMMARY:
Trump's grandiose behavior is on full display as he misuses the term "treason" to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its actual meaning of betraying one's country. He has used the word over two dozen times on Twitter this year alone, labeling political opponents, including Democrats and prosecutors, as "TREASONOUS". This is a disturbing and inaccurate understanding of the term, which is a serious crime punishable by death. Trump's use of the word echoes the way monarchs used it in the past to execute political opponents. Experts, such as Carlton Larson, find Trump's understanding of treason to be "woefully" inaccurate and "quite disturbing". Trump's actions are a betrayal of the country's values and a disloyalty to the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
