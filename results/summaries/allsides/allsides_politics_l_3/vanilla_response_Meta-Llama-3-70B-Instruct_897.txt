SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity and self-conception are manifested in his language, particularly in his use of the word "treason". Trump has used the term to describe disloyalty to himself, rather than its constitutional definition of betraying the country. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, targeting political opponents such as Democrats, prosecutors, and lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump's use of the term is anachronistic and echoes the way monarchs used it in the past to punish those who betrayed them. Experts argue that Trump's understanding of treason is inaccurate and disturbing, and that his casual use of the term is unprecedented among presidents. The article suggests that Trump's language is a form of political weaponization, blurring the line between loyalty to the country and loyalty to himself.
