Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points about Trump's misuse of the term 'treason' and its implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main arguments. The article discusses how Trump frequently uses the word 'treason' in a way that's inconsistent with its legal definition. He's applying it to political opponents, which is problematic because the framers of the Constitution were careful to define treason narrowly to prevent misuse.

I need to highlight Trump's grandiosity and how he's redefining treason to target political enemies. The article mentions specific instances, like tweets against Democrats and Nancy Pelosi, so including those examples would strengthen the summary.

Also, the moral angle is important. The author points out that Trump is conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself, which is reminiscent of monarchical times. This misuse could have dangerous implications, as it blurs the lines between political dissent and actual treason.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence of Trump's misuse, the historical context of treason, and the expert opinion from Carlton Larson. Ending with the consequences of such casual use will tie it all together.

Let me structure it step by step: start with Trump's grandiosity, mention his use of 'treason,' provide examples, explain the legal definition, contrast with his usage, include the expert's opinion, and conclude with the implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear to convey the moral issue effectively.

SUMMARY: The article examines how President Trump frequently uses the term "treason" to describe political opposition, redefining it as disloyalty to himself rather than the traditional legal definition outlined in the Constitution. Treason, as defined in Article III, involves betraying the country through acts like levying war or aiding enemies. Trump, however, has weaponized the term to target political opponents, such as Democrats opposing his policies or those involved in the impeachment probe, labeling them "treasonous" without justification. His misuse echoes historical contexts where monarchs used treason accusations to silence dissent, conflating loyalty to the country with loyalty to the leader. Legal expert Carlton Larson criticizes Trump's casual use of the term, noting it distorts the concept and risks equating political opposition with betrayal, a practice common in authoritarian regimes. Trump's anachronistic approach blurs the line between legitimate criticism and treason, raising concerns about its implications for democracy and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
