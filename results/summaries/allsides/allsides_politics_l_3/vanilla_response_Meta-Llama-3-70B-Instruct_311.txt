SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Trump's grandiosity is manifested in his language, particularly in his use of the word "treason". Trump has used the term to describe disloyalty to him personally, rather than its constitutional definition of levying war against the US or aiding its enemies. He has tweeted the word over two dozen times this year, targeting political opponents such as Democrats, prosecutors, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Experts argue that Trump's misuse of the term is disturbing and anachronistic, echoing the way monarchs used it in the past to execute political opponents. Trump's understanding of treason is inaccurate and confuses loyalty to the country with loyalty to himself. This is particularly concerning, as treason is a serious crime that can lead to execution in many countries.
