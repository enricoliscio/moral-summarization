SUMMARY:
Trump's grandiose language, particularly his use of the first-person singular pronoun, positions himself as the hero of the American story. His misuse of the term "treason," which refers to betrayal of one's country, is disturbing. He confuses loyalty to himself with loyalty to the country, a notion akin to the old English idea of betrayal of the king. Trump casually throws around the term, inaccurately labeling political opponents as traitors and villains. He accuses those who resist his agenda, such as Representative Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of treason and fraudulent behavior. Trump's inappropriate use of treason echoes monarchical rule, where it was often used to execute political opponents. Experts find his misunderstanding of the term woefully inaccurate and disturbing, as it blurs the line between loyalty to a leader and loyalty to a nation.
