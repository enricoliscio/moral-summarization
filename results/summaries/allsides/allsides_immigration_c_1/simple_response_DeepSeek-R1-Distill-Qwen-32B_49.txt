Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the article. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are:

1. New visa rules to restrict birth tourism.
2. Women traveling to the U.S. to give birth for citizenship.
3. Denial of tourist visas if primary purpose is giving birth.
4. Requirement to prove medical necessity and ability to pay.
5. White House statement on protecting citizenship integrity and taxpayer dollars.
6. The practice is legal but some agencies have faced issues.
7. The rules take effect Friday, affecting pregnant women at the border too.
8. Criticism about potential risks to women and enforcement challenges.
9. The lucrative birth tourism industry, especially from Russia and China.
10. No exact numbers but estimates from 2012.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. The article presents birth tourism as an abuse that needs stopping for national security and taxpayer protection. It also mentions critics' concerns about risks and enforcement.

I'll structure the summary to include the new rules, their purpose, the administration's stance, the industry's context, and the criticisms. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing, like protecting citizenship integrity and taxpayer money, while also noting the concerns about enforcement and risks to women.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all key points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, ensuring their children gain U.S. citizenship. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose of the visit is childbirth. Applicants must prove a legitimate medical need and financial ability to cover expenses. The administration claims this will protect American citizenship's integrity, safeguard national security, and prevent taxpayer dollars from funding birth tourism. Critics argue the policy could risk pregnant women's safety and raise enforcement challenges, as officers cannot directly inquire about pregnancy during visa interviews. Birth tourism, a lucrative industry, involves companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, primarily attracting women from Russia and China. The U.S. has been cracking down on this practice, though no exact figures exist on its prevalence. The new rules aim to eliminate criminal activity linked to birth tourism, including visa fraud and misrepresentation of travel purposes. END OF SUMMARY.
