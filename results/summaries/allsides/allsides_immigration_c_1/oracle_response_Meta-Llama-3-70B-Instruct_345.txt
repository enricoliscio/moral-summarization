SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules aim to protect the US from national security risks and defend American taxpayers from shouldering the costs associated with this practice. The new rules require applicants to prove they are traveling to the US for medical needs, not just to give birth, and must demonstrate they have the financial means to pay for their treatment. The administration claims this will help eliminate the criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry, which has been plagued by fraud and evasion. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, with the administration seeking to restrict all forms of immigration. Critics argue that the rules could put pregnant women at risk, but the administration insists it will help protect the integrity of American citizenship. END OF SUMMARY.
