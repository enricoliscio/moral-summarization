Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. My task is twofold: first, identify all the single words with moral framing, and second, summarize the article while preserving those moral terms.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "restrict," "abuses," "protect," "endemic," "siphoned," "loophole," "integrity," "crackdown," "vulnerable," "plagued," "scholars," "critics," "risk," "lucrative," "criminal," and "schemes" stand out. These terms convey judgment or evaluation, fitting the moral framing.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words while including as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the key points: the new visa rules, the administration's justification, the opposition, and the implications. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral aspects like protecting national security, taxpayer dollars, and the integrity of citizenship, while also noting criticisms about risks to pregnant women and the lucrative industry behind birth tourism.

I should also be concise, making sure each sentence adds value without exceeding the word limit. I'll structure the summary to first introduce the policy, then the administration's stance, followed by the criticisms, and conclude with the broader context of birth tourism as a business.

Finally, I'll review to ensure all identified moral words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining a clear and coherent structure.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and the financial means to cover expenses. The administration claims this will protect national security, taxpayer dollars, and the integrity of U.S. citizenship. Critics argue the policy could put pregnant women at risk, as consular officers cannot explicitly ask about pregnancy but must still assess intentions. Birth tourism is a lucrative industry, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, primarily serving women from Russia and China. While the practice is legal, authorities occasionally arrest operators for visa fraud or tax evasion. The rules aim to eliminate criminal activity linked to birth tourism but raise concerns about enforcement and potential risks to women.
