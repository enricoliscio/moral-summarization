Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user is asking for a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points. The article is about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. 

First, I'll identify the main elements: the purpose of the rules, who they affect, and the implications. The rules aim to prevent women from coming to the U.S. to give birth for citizenship. They're denying tourist visas if the primary purpose is childbirth. 

Next, the article mentions that applicants must prove they have a medical need and can afford the expenses. It also quotes the White House press secretary, emphasizing national security and taxpayer protection. 

I should note that while birth tourism is legal, there have been cases of agencies being arrested for fraud. The new rules take effect Friday and affect not just visa applicants but also women at the U.S.-Mexico border. 

Additionally, the article discusses the broader context, like the administration's stance on birthright citizenship and the challenges in regulating this. Critics are concerned about risks to pregnant women and the practicality of enforcing these rules. 

Finally, the economic aspect is important: birth tourism is a big business, with companies charging up to $80,000. I'll include that as well. 

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and covers all these points succinctly. I'll structure it to first state the new rules, their purpose, how they're enforced, the administration's stance, the legal context, the impact on border crossings, and the economic and critical perspectives. 

Let me piece it together, ensuring clarity and brevity. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward so the summary is easily understandable.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is childbirth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and can afford related expenses. The administration aims to close a "glaring loophole" and protect national security and taxpayers. Birth tourism is legal but has faced scrutiny due to visa fraud and tax evasion cases. The rules, effective Friday, classify birth tourism as illegitimate for pleasure or recreation. The U.S. has long targeted this practice, with critics warning it could endanger pregnant women. The industry, which charges up to $80,000, attracts women from countries like Russia and China. The administration also restricts pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of broader immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
