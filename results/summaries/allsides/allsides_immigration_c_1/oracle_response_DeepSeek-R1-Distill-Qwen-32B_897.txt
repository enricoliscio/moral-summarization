Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should use the morally framed words they listed. I should first read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to restrict birth tourism, where women come to the U.S. to give birth for citizenship. The rules aim to prevent this by denying visas if the primary purpose is giving birth, requiring proof of medical need and financial means. The author uses words like "closing," "combat," "abuses," etc., which I need to incorporate into the summary. I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral terms as possible. I'll structure it by first stating the action, the purpose, the requirements, and the criticisms, using the specified words to maintain the moral tone. Also, I need to end with the "END OF SUMMARY." token as instructed.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to "close" a loophole in U.S. immigration policy, targeting "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, consular officers will deny tourist visas to those primarily coming to the U.S. to give birth, requiring proof of a "legitimate" medical need and financial means to cover all expenses. The administration aims to "combat" abuses and "protect" national security and taxpayers from "siphoned" funds. The rules label birth tourism as an "illegitimate" activity, though it remains legal. Critics argue the policy could put pregnant women at "risk" and question how officers will determine pregnancy intent. The U.S. has long targeted birth tourism, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, particularly attracting women from Russia and China. The rules also aim to "eliminate" criminal activity linked to visa "fraud" and "evasion," as seen in recent federal indictments. END OF SUMMARY.
