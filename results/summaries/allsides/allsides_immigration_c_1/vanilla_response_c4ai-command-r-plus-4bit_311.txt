SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth to gain citizenship for their children. Consular officers will deny tourist visas if they believe applicants are primarily coming to the US to give birth, and those with medical needs must prove they can pay for treatment and living expenses. The White House press secretary defended the move, citing national security and taxpayer costs. While birth tourism is fundamentally legal, authorities have arrested operators of birth tourism agencies for fraud and evasion. The State Department does not view birth tourism as a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules raise concerns about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and the potential risks for pregnant women. Critics argue that the policy could endanger pregnant women. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services, and the US has been cracking down on the practice for some time. The State Department estimates that in 2012, about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the US and then left. The new rule aims to eliminate the criminal activity associated with birth tourism.
