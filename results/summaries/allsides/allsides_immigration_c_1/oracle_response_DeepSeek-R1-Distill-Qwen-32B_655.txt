Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism." They're targeting women who come to the U.S. to give birth so their children can get citizenship. The rules state that if a consular officer determines the primary purpose is giving birth, the visa will be denied. They have to prove they're coming for medical needs, not just to have a child here. The administration's reasoning is about protecting national security, taxpayers, and the integrity of citizenship. They mention it's a loophole and a form of abuse. 

I notice the author uses words like "closing," "combat," "abuses," "protect," "defend," "siphoned," "protected," "fraud," "evasion," "obtaining," "risk," "eliminate," "activity," "lied." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the administration's action, then the rules, the reasoning, and the criticisms. I'll make sure to include the moral terms where appropriate.

I need to structure it so that each sentence incorporates the moral framing. For example, the administration is "closing a loophole" to "combat abuses" and "protect national security." They're also "defending taxpayers" from "siphoned" money. The critics argue it might "put women at risk" and question how officers will determine pregnancy, which ties into "fraud" and "lied."

I'll also mention that birth tourism is legal but has some illegal aspects, like visa fraud. The State Department sees it as an illegitimate activity, and the rule aims to "eliminate criminal activity." I'll note that the U.S. has been cracking down on this before Trump, and the rule's effectiveness and risks are debated.

Now, putting it all together, making sure to hit all the key points with the moral language intact. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence flows and includes the necessary terms without being redundant.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to "close" a loophole in U.S. immigration policy, targeting "birth tourism" where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, applicants deemed to be coming primarily to give birth will be denied tourist visas, unless they can prove a "legitimate medical need." This move aims to "combat" the "abuses" associated with birth tourism, "protect" national security, and "defend" American taxpayers from "siphoned" funds. The administration emphasizes the need to "protect" the "integrity" of U.S. citizenship, calling the practice an "endemic" issue. Critics argue the rules may "put pregnant women at risk" and question how consular officers will determine intent. The State Department deems birth tourism an "illegitimate activity," and the rule seeks to "eliminate" the "criminal activity" linked to it. While the practice is legal, authorities have arrested some operators for "fraud" and "evasion." The U.S. has long targeted birth tourism, with critics debating the policy's effectiveness and ethical implications. END OF SUMMARY.
