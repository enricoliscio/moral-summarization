SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "endemic abuses" of "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules aim to protect the "integrity of American citizenship" and prevent "hard-earned dollars" from being "siphoned away" to finance the practice. The administration claims that "birth tourism" is not a "legitimate activity" and has been cracking down on the practice, which is often facilitated by a "lucrative" industry. Critics argue that the rules could put pregnant women at risk, but the administration believes they will help eliminate the "criminal activity" associated with the industry. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, with the administration seeking to restrict all forms of immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
