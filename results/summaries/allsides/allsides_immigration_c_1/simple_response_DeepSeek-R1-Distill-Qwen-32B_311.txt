Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. They also want me to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the key points without losing the essence of the article's tone.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the new visa rules aimed at preventing women from coming to the U.S. to give birth for citizenship. The rules state that if a woman's primary reason is giving birth, they'll be denied a tourist visa. They also mention that those with medical needs can still apply but need to prove they can cover all expenses. The White House is framing this as protecting national security and taxpayer money.

I need to highlight the administration's stance on protecting citizenship integrity. Also, the article notes that birth tourism is legal but sometimes involves fraud. The new rules take effect Friday and target visa applicants, not just those at the border. There's criticism about how officers will determine pregnancy and potential risks to women.

I should structure the summary to include the new rules, the administration's reasoning, the legality of birth tourism, the impact on visa applicants, and the criticisms. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but thorough.

I also need to maintain the moral framing, so I should mention the administration's arguments about national security and taxpayer protection, as well as the counterarguments about potential risks and the lucrative nature of the birth tourism industry.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure each key point is included without getting bogged down in details. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral aspects are clearly presented.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, ensuring their children gain U.S. citizenship. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is childbirth. Applicants must prove they are traveling for medical necessity, not just to give birth, and must demonstrate financial ability to cover all expenses. The administration claims this will protect national security, taxpayer dollars, and the integrity of U.S. citizenship. While birth tourism is legal, it often involves fraud or tax evasion. Critics argue the rules could risk pregnant women's safety, as consular officers cannot directly ask about pregnancy but must assess intent. The U.S. has long targeted birth tourism, with companies offering services for up to $80,000, attracting women from countries like Russia and China. The rules aim to eliminate criminal activity tied to the industry, though no data exists on the scale of the practice. END OF SUMMARY.
