SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism", where women travel to the United States to give birth, thus granting their children US citizenship. Consular officers will deny tourist visas if they believe the primary purpose of the trip is to give birth in the US. This move aims to combat endemic abuses and protect the integrity of American citizenship. It will also defend American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The State Department does not consider birth tourism a legitimate activity and believes it poses national security risks. While the practice of traveling to the US to give birth is legal, the administration has also turned away pregnant women at the border as part of its broader immigration crackdown. The new rules raise concerns about how officers will determine pregnancy status and the potential risks to pregnant women. Critics argue that the policy could endanger pregnant women and that consular officers do not have the right to inquire about pregnancy or intentions to become pregnant. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services. The US has been cracking down on this industry, with recent federal indictments highlighting birth tourism schemes involving visa fraud and lies to consular officers. These new rules are expected to help eliminate criminal activity and protect US national interests.
