Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism." The main moral terms used are "closing," "combat," "abuses," "protect," "defend," "siphoned," "protected," "fraud," "evasion," "obtaining," "risk," "eliminate," "activity," and "lied." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating the action taken by the Trump administration. Then, I'll mention the new visa rules, emphasizing how they aim to combat birth tourism by denying visas to those primarily coming to give birth. I should highlight the financial burden on taxpayers and the national security risks mentioned.

I also need to note that the rules require proof of medical necessity and financial means, which ties into the moral framing of protecting the integrity of citizenship and preventing fraud. It's important to mention that the practice is legal but has led to abuses, and the administration's broader immigration crackdown, including turning away pregnant women at the border.

I should also touch on the criticism, such as potential risks to pregnant women and the challenges in determining pregnancy during visa interviews. Including the lucrative nature of the birth tourism industry adds context about why these rules are necessary.

Finally, I'll wrap up by mentioning the lack of exact numbers but referencing estimates from the Center for Immigration Studies to show the scale. I need to ensure all the moral terms are naturally integrated without making the summary too verbose.

Let me structure this step by step to make sure all points are covered succinctly while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to "close" a loophole in U.S. immigration policy, targeting "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. The rules aim to "combat" abuses by denying tourist visas to those primarily coming to give birth, requiring proof of medical necessity and financial means to cover expenses. The administration claims this will "protect" national security, "defend" taxpayers from "siphoned" funds, and "preserve" the integrity of U.S. citizenship. Critics argue the policy could put pregnant women at "risk" and question how consular officers will determine intent. Birth tourism is a "lucrative" industry, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, often involving "fraud" or "evasion." The rules also address "criminal activity" linked to birth tourism, such as "lied" visa applications. While the practice is legal, the administration seeks to "eliminate" its associated risks and "abuses." END OF SUMMARY.
