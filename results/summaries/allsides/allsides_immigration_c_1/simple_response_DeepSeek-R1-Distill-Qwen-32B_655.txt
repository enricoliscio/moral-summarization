Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about how the U.S. is restricting tourist visas for women coming to give birth to secure citizenship for their children. The new rules state that if a consular officer determines that the primary purpose is giving birth, the visa will be denied. Applicants must show they have a medical need and the funds to cover expenses. The White House claims this protects national security and taxpayer money. The article also mentions that birth tourism is technically legal but has some illegal cases, like visa fraud. The State Department sees it as not a legitimate recreational activity. The administration has also turned away pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border. Critics worry this could put women at risk, and determining pregnancy during visa interviews is tricky. The birth tourism industry is profitable, with companies charging up to $80,000. There are no exact numbers on how many women do this, but an estimate from 2012 is around 36,000. The rule aims to eliminate criminal activity linked to birth tourism.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, preserving the moral framing. I'll start by stating the new visa rules and their purpose. Mention the criteria for denial and the need for medical justification and funding. Highlight the White House's stance on protecting citizenship and taxpayers. Note that birth tourism is legal but sometimes involves fraud. The State Department's view on it not being a legitimate activity. Also, mention the broader immigration crackdown, the critics' concerns, and the industry's profitability. End with the estimate from 2012 and the aim to combat criminal activity.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the key points without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects, like protecting citizenship integrity and taxpayer money, as well as the concerns about putting women at risk. Keeping it concise is crucial, so I'll avoid unnecessary details and focus on the essentials.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, granting their children U.S. citizenship. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is childbirth. Applicants must demonstrate a medical need and the financial means to cover all expenses, aligning with other medical travelers. The administration argues this protects U.S. citizenship integrity, national security, and taxpayer funds. While birth tourism is legal, it sometimes involves fraud or tax evasion. The State Department deems it an illegitimate recreational activity. The policy also targets pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border. Critics warn it could endanger women, as officers cannot directly ask about pregnancy but must assess intent. The lucrative industry charges up to $80,000, with many women from Russia and China. No exact figures exist, but an estimate suggests 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S. in 2012. The rule aims to eliminate criminal activity tied to birth tourism. END OF SUMMARY.
