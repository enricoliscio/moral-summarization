SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," a practice deemed "illegitimate" and "abusive" by the White House. The rules aim to restrict women from traveling to the US solely to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are suspected of doing so, and must prove they have a medical need to travel to the US. The administration claims this will "protect" American taxpayers from shouldering the costs associated with birth tourism and "defend" the "integrity" of American citizenship. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raises questions about how officers will determine a woman's intentions. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, with the administration seeking to restrict all forms of immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
