SUMMARY: The Trump administration published new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth to gain citizenship for their children. Consular officers will deny tourist visas if they believe the primary purpose of the visit is to give birth in the US. This new rule combats the abuse of birthright citizenship and defends American taxpayers from financing birth tourism. It also raises ethical questions about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and the potential risks for pregnant women who may be turned away. The State Department believes that birth tourism is not a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The practice has been criticized for being a lucrative business with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services. While there are no exact numbers, it is estimated that around 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the US and then left in 2012. This new rule aims to eliminate the criminal activity and fraud associated with birth tourism by closing a loophole that has been exploited.
