SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules require applicants to prove they are traveling to the US for medical needs, not just to give birth, and must demonstrate they have the financial means to pay for their trip. The administration claims this move will combat "endemic abuses" and protect American taxpayers from shouldering the costs associated with birth tourism. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raises questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant or intends to become so. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, with the Trump administration seeking to restrict all forms of immigration. The practice of birthright citizenship, where anyone born in the US is considered a citizen, remains a contentious issue.
