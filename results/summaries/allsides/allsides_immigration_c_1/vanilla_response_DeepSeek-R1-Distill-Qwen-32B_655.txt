Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about new visa rules targeting birth tourism. Let me read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the Trump administration has published new visa rules to restrict birth tourism. Birth tourism is when women come to the US to give birth so their kids get citizenship. The key points are that tourist visas will be denied if the primary reason is to give birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need, not just to have a child here. They also need to show they can afford all expenses, including medical and living costs.

The article quotes the White House press secretary, emphasizing protection of national security and taxpayer money. It also notes that while birth tourism is legal, there have been cases of agencies being arrested for fraud. The new rules state that using the US for citizenship via birth isn't a legitimate recreational activity.

Additionally, the administration is turning away pregnant women at the US-Mexico border as part of broader immigration efforts. The issue of birthright citizenship is a big concern for Trump, though it's constitutionally protected. Critics worry the new policy might put women at risk, and there are questions about how officers will determine pregnancy during visa interviews.

The business side is mentioned tooâ€”birth tourism is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80k. Many women come from Russia and China. The article also states there's no data on how many women come for this purpose, but an estimate from 2012 suggests around 36,000.

So, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the new visa rules, their purpose, the requirements, the administration's stance, the legal context, and the criticism. I'll also include the business aspect and the lack of data. Need to keep it concise and cover all main points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose of the visit is childbirth. Applicants must prove they have a legitimate medical need and the financial means to cover all expenses, including medical care and living costs. The administration claims this will protect national security and taxpayer funds, as birth tourism is seen as an "endemic abuse." While the practice is legal, critics argue the new policy could put pregnant women at risk, as consular officers cannot directly inquire about pregnancy during visa interviews. The U.S. has long targeted birth tourism, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, primarily attracting women from Russia and China. The administration also restricts pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of broader immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
