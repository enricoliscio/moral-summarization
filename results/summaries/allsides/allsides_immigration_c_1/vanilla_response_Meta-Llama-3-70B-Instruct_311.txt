SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Under the new rules, applicants will be denied tourist visas if consular officers determine they are coming to the US primarily to give birth. Those with medical needs will be treated like other foreigners coming to the US for medical treatment and must prove they have the means to pay for it. The administration claims this will combat abuses and protect American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The practice is legal, but the administration has been cracking down on it as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Critics argue the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant.

END OF SUMMARY.
