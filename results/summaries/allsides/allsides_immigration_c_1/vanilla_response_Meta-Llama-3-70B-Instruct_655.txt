SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Under the new rules, applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are deemed to be coming to the US primarily to give birth. Consular officers will determine whether a woman is traveling to the US for medical needs or solely to give birth. Women with medical needs will be treated like other foreigners coming to the US for medical treatment and must prove they have the means to pay for it. The move aims to combat national security risks and protect American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The practice of traveling to the US to give birth is legal, but authorities have arrested operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud or tax evasion.
