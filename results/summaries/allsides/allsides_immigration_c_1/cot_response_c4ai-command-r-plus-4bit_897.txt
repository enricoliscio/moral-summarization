SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has published new visa rules targeting "birth tourism," aiming to restrict women from traveling to the United States to give birth and obtain U.S. citizenship for their children. Consular officers will deny tourist visas if they determine that the primary purpose of the visit is to give birth in the U.S. This move is intended to combat the "endemic abuses" and protect the "integrity of American citizenship." The administration considers birth tourism a form of fraud and evasion, with some operators arrested for visa fraud and tax evasion. While the practice is fundamentally legal, the State Department does not view it as a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules will make it harder for pregnant women to obtain visas, requiring them to prove their medical need and financial capacity. Critics argue that this policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers would determine pregnancy. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services. The administration justifies its actions by citing national security risks and the financial burden on taxpayers, protecting the integrity of U.S. citizenship from what it considers to be illegitimate entitlement.
