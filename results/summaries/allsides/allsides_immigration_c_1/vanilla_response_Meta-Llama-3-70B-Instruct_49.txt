SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Under the new rules, applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are deemed to be coming to the US primarily to give birth. Consular officers will have to determine whether a woman's primary purpose is to give birth, and those with medical needs will have to prove they have the funds to pay for treatment. The administration claims this will combat "endemic abuses" and protect American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The practice is fundamentally legal, but the administration has been cracking down on it as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Critics argue that the new policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant.
