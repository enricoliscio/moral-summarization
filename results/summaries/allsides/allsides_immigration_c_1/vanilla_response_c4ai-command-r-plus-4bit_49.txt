SUMMARY: The Trump administration published new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," denying tourist visas to applicants deemed to be coming to the U.S. primarily to give birth. The new rules require pregnant women to prove they have the financial means to pay for medical treatment and other expenses. The White House stated that the measure protects the integrity of American citizenship and defends taxpayers from financing birth tourism. While the practice of traveling to the U.S. to give birth is legal, the State Department considers it an abuse of the visa system. The new rules raise concerns about how officers will determine pregnancy status and the potential risks for pregnant women. Critics argue that the policy could result in discrimination and put pregnant women in danger. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies facilitating the process and charging up to $80,000. The U.S. has been cracking down on this practice for some time, and the new rules are part of the administration's broader efforts to restrict immigration.
