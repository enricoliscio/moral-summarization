SUMMARY: The Trump administration published new visa rules aimed at restricting “birth tourism,” an industry that has been deemed abusive and fraudulent. By denying tourist visas to applicants who are determined to be coming to the U.S. primarily to give birth, the administration aims to protect the integrity of American citizenship and defend American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The State Department does not believe that visiting the U.S. for the primary purpose of obtaining citizenship for a child through birth is a legitimate activity and has deemed it a national security risk. The new rules, which take effect immediately, will help combat the criminal activity and lies associated with birth tourism, protecting taxpayers' hard-earned dollars from being siphoned away. While the practice of traveling to the U.S. to give birth is fundamentally legal, the administration argues that regulating it is necessary to eliminate the endemic abuses and risks associated with this activity.
