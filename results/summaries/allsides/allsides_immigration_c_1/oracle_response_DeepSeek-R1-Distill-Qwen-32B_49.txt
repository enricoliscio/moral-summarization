Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration introduced new visa rules to restrict birth tourism. Birth tourism is when women come to the US to give birth so their kids get citizenship. The new rules make it harder for these women to get tourist visas unless they have a medical need. They also have to prove they can pay for everything, including living expenses.

The article mentions that the administration is trying to "close" a loophole, "combat" abuses, and "protect" national security and taxpayers. They're also talking about "fraud" and "evasion" in the process. The opponents argue that this might put women at "risk" and question how officers will determine pregnancy during visa interviews.

I need to include words like "closing," "combat," "abuses," "protect," "defend," "siphoned," "protected," "fraud," "evasion," "obtaining," "risk," "eliminate," "activity," "lied." 

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's actions using these terms. I'll start by stating the new rules aim to restrict birth tourism, using "close" and "combat." Then mention the requirement for medical needs and payment proof. Include the quotes about protecting citizenship and taxpayers. Note that the practice is legal but involves some fraud. Also, mention the criticism about potential risks to women and the challenges in enforcement.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all the key moral terms without making it too wordy.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, ensuring their children gain U.S. citizenship. Under these rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose of the visit is childbirth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and the financial means to cover all expenses, including transportation and living costs. The administration aims to "close" a loophole, "combat" abuses, and "protect" national security and taxpayers from being "siphoned" by birth tourism's costs. The State Department deems birth tourism an illegitimate activity, though it remains fundamentally legal. Critics argue the policy could "risk" pregnant women's safety and question how officers will determine pregnancy intentions. The administration also targets pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of broader immigration restrictions. The move raises concerns about enforcement and potential "fraud" or "evasion" in the birth tourism industry, which has been linked to "lied" visa applications and "criminal activity." The rules aim to "eliminate" such practices while "protecting" the integrity of U.S. citizenship.  
END OF SUMMARY.
