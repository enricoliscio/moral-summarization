SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the United States to give birth, entitling their children to US citizenship. The practice is fundamentally legal, but the State Department does not believe it is a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules will deny tourist visas to applicants who are determined to be coming to the US primarily to give birth, creating a hurdle for pregnant women seeking to enter the country. This change in policy raises concerns about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and if this could lead to pregnant women being turned away at the border.

The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, and it is believed that thousands of women travel to the US specifically to give birth. The Trump administration has justified the new rules as a way to protect the integrity of American citizenship and prevent national security risks and financial costs associated with birth tourism. While the practice is legal, there have been cases of authorities arresting operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud and tax evasion. The new policy has been criticized for potentially putting pregnant women at risk and for raising ethical questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant.
