SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules aim to protect the US from national security risks and defend American taxpayers from shouldering the costs associated with this practice. Consular officers will deny tourist visas to applicants suspected of coming to the US primarily to give birth, unless they can prove a medical need. The administration claims that closing this "glaring immigration loophole" will eliminate endemic abuses and protect the integrity of American citizenship. Critics argue that the rules may put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant. The practice of birth tourism is considered a lucrative business, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the process. The new rules aim to combat fraud and evasion associated with this industry.
