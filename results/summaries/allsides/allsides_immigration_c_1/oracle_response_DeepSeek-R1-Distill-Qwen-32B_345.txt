Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to tackle "birth tourism." They're targeting women who come to the U.S. to give birth for citizenship. The rules state that tourist visas will be denied if the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and the funds to cover expenses. The administration uses strong moral terms like "closing," "combat," "abuses," "protect," "defend," etc.

I should highlight the administration's actions using these terms. Also, mention the potential risks and criticisms, like how the rules might not be easy to enforce and could endanger some women. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the specified moral words as possible.

Let me structure the summary: start with the new rules, mention the denial of visas, the need to prove medical necessity, the administration's stance on protecting citizenship and taxpayers, then touch on the criticisms and risks. Make sure to use the moral framing words throughout.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too technical. Let me draft it step by step, checking each moral term and ensuring they fit naturally into the summary.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to "close" a loophole in U.S. immigration policy, targeting "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a "medical need" and the financial means to cover all expenses, including transportation and living costs. The administration aims to "combat" abuses and "protect" national security and American taxpayers from "siphoned" funds. They argue the practice undermines the "integrity" of U.S. citizenship. Critics warn the rules may "risk" pregnant women's safety and raise concerns about enforcement, as officers cannot directly inquire about pregnancy. The "fraud" and "evasion" associated with birth tourism have led to federal indictments, with the administration seeking to "eliminate" such criminal activity. The practice remains "lucrative," with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the process, though no official figures exist on the number of foreign women involved. END OF SUMMARY.
