SUMMARY: 
The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," a practice where women travel to the United States to give birth, entitling their children to U.S. citizenship. The rules, which take effect Friday, will deny tourist visas to applicants if consular officers determine that giving birth in the U.S. is their primary purpose of travel. This move is intended to defend the integrity of American citizenship and protect national security, according to the White House. While the practice is fundamentally legal, it has been associated with scattered cases of visa fraud and tax evasion, and the administration considers it illegitimate. The new policy has been criticized for putting pregnant women at risk, and it raises questions about how officers will determine pregnancy status. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services, and it has been a target of U.S. crackdowns even before Trump's presidency.
