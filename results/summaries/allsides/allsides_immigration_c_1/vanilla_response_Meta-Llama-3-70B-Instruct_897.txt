SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Under the new rules, applicants will be denied tourist visas if consular officers determine they are coming to the US primarily to give birth. To overcome this hurdle, applicants must prove they have a medical need and can afford the associated costs, including transportation and living expenses. The practice of birth tourism is legal, but authorities have arrested operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud and tax evasion. The new rules aim to combat the "endemic abuses" and protect American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. The rules take effect on Friday and are part of the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown.

END OF SUMMARY.
