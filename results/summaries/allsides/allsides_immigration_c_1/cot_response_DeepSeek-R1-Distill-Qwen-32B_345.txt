Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand what the article is about. It's about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to prevent "birth tourism." Birth tourism is when women come to the U.S. to give birth so their kids can get U.S. citizenship. The rules say that if a consular officer thinks someone is coming mainly to give birth, they'll deny the tourist visa. The applicants have to prove they have a medical need, not just wanting to give birth here. They also need to show they can pay for all expenses, including transportation and living costs.

The article mentions that the White House sees this as closing an immigration loophole, protecting national security, and saving taxpayer money. They argue that birth tourism is not a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The State Department doesn't consider it a legitimate reason for a tourist visa. The administration is also turning away pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a broader crackdown on immigration.

The issue of birthright citizenship is a big one for Trump, who has criticized it and even threatened to end it. However, scholars and his own administration say it's not easy to change. The article also notes that birth tourism is a lucrative business, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate this. Many women come from Russia and China. There are no exact numbers on how many do this, but an estimate from 2012 suggests around 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S. and then left.

Critics worry that the new rules could put pregnant women at risk, and consular officers can't directly ask about pregnancy but have to infer intent. The article also mentions that birth tourism involves criminal activity like visa fraud and tax evasion.

So, for the summary, I need to include the key points: new visa rules, targeting birth tourism, denying visas if the main purpose is giving birth, requiring proof of medical need and financial means, the administration's stance on protecting national security and taxpayer money, the lucrative nature of birth tourism, and the criticism about potential risks to women.

I should make sure to use the morally framed words like "restrict," "abuses," "protect," "siphoned away," "integrity," "endemic," "loophole," "crackdown," "vulnerable," "lucrative," "criminal activity," and "scheme."

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these elements. Let me structure it: start with the administration's action, the purpose, the requirements, the administration's reasoning, the industry's nature, and the criticisms.

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," targeting women traveling to the U.S. primarily to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under these rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the main purpose is childbirth. Applicants must prove a medical need and financial capacity to cover all expenses. The administration aims to protect national security and taxpayer funds, deeming birth tourism non-legitimate. This lucrative industry, often involving fraud, sees women from countries like Russia and China paying up to $80,000 for services. Critics argue the rules may risk pregnant women, as officers can't inquire about pregnancy directly but must assess intent. The move reflects broader immigration crackdowns and Trump's opposition to birthright citizenship, though legal changes are complex.
