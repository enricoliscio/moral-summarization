Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. They provided the article, so I need to read through it carefully to extract the key points.

First, the main topic is the new visa rules. The article mentions that the rules are aimed at preventing women from coming to the US to give birth for citizenship. So I should note that the Trump administration published these rules in the Federal Register.

Next, the rules state that tourist visas will be denied if the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need, not just wanting citizenship. They also need to show they can pay for all expenses, including medical, transportation, and living costs.

The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, is quoted, emphasizing the protection of national security and taxpayer money. She mentions that birth tourism is not a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation.

The article also mentions that birth tourism is legal but sometimes involves illegal activities like visa fraud. The new rules take effect Friday and target specifically this practice, while also noting that the administration has been turning away pregnant women at the US-Mexico border as part of broader immigration policies.

President Trump has been against birthright citizenship, but scholars say it's hard to change. The US has been cracking down on this since before Trump, and the new rules are another step. However, critics worry about how officers will determine pregnancy and the risk to women.

Birth tourism is a big business, with companies charging up to $80,000, especially from Russia and China. There are no exact numbers on how many women come for this purpose, but an estimate from 2012 is around 36,000.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include the main points: the new visa rules, the requirement for medical necessity, the denial of visas for primary purpose of giving birth, the administration's stance, the legal vs. illegal aspects, the impact on national security and taxpayers, the broader immigration crackdown, and the criticism about enforcement and risks to women.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the announcement, the specifics of the rules, the reasoning behind them, and the criticisms. Keeping it concise but informative is key.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, ensuring their children gain U.S. citizenship. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they are traveling for medical needs and can cover all associated costs, including medical care, transportation, and living expenses. The administration claims this will protect national security and taxpayers from costs linked to birth tourism. While the practice is legal, it often involves fraud or tax evasion. Critics argue the rules may put pregnant women at risk, as officers cannot ask about pregnancy during visa interviews but must still assess intent. Birth tourism is a lucrative industry, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the process, particularly attracting women from Russia and China. The U.S. has been cracking down on this practice for years, though changing birthright citizenship remains challenging. END OF SUMMARY.
