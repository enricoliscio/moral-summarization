Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article explains that the Trump administration has published new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women come to the U.S. to give birth so their children can get U.S. citizenship. The rules state that tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is to give birth. Applicants must prove they're coming for medical reasons, not just to have a child here. They also need to show they can cover all expenses, including transportation and living costs.

The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, supports this, saying it protects national security and taxpayer money. The article mentions that birth tourism is technically legal, but there are occasional arrests for visa fraud or tax evasion. The new rules take effect Friday and classify birth tourism as not a legitimate recreational activity.

Additionally, the Trump administration has been turning away pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of broader immigration enforcement. President Trump has been critical of birthright citizenship, but changing it is complicated. The U.S. has been cracking down on this practice even before Trump, and regulating tourist visas is one approach. Critics worry it might put pregnant women at risk since consular officers can't directly ask about pregnancy but still have to assess intent.

Birth tourism is a profitable industry, with companies charging up to $80,000, especially attracting women from Russia and China. There are no exact numbers on how many foreign women come to the U.S. for this, but an estimate from 2012 suggests around 36,000. The rules aim to eliminate criminal activities linked to birth tourism, referencing federal indictments where visa applicants lied about their trips.

So, to summarize, I need to capture the key points: new visa rules targeting birth tourism, the requirement for medical necessity, financial proof, the administration's stance on protecting citizenship integrity, the industry's profitability, and the concerns raised. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
