SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth so their children have US citizenship. Consular officers will deny tourist visas if they believe applicants are primarily coming to the US to give birth. This change makes it harder for pregnant women to obtain visas and requires them to prove they have the financial means to cover medical and living expenses. The White House press secretary defended the decision, stating it will protect national security and American taxpayers. While birth tourism is fundamentally legal, the State Department does not view it as a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules will take effect on Friday. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers would determine if a woman is pregnant. The US has been cracking down on birth tourism for some time, with companies facilitating the practice charging up to $80,000 for their services. The State Department estimates that in 2012, about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the US and then left. The new rules aim to eliminate the criminal activity associated with birth tourism and protect the integrity of American citizenship.
END OF SUMMARY.
