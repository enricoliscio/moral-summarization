SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the U.S. to give birth, entitling their children to U.S. citizenship. Consular officers can now deny tourist visas if they believe the primary purpose of the visit is to give birth in the U.S. Foreigners coming to the U.S. for medical treatment, including childbirth, must prove they have the financial means to cover expenses. The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, stated that closing this loophole protects national security and taxpayers' money. While the practice of birth tourism is legal, there have been cases of fraud and tax evasion. The State Department does not view birth tourism as a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules raise concerns about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and the potential risks for pregnant women. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services. Critics argue that the policy could endanger pregnant women, and officers do not have the right to inquire about pregnancy during visa interviews. The U.S. has been addressing birth tourism for years, and the issue of birthright citizenship has been a particular focus for President Trump.
