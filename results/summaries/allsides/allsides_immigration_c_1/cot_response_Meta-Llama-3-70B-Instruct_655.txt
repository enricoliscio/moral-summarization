SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," a practice deemed "endemic" and "abusive." The rules aim to restrict women from traveling to the US solely to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are found to be coming to the US primarily to give birth. The administration claims this will protect the "integrity" of American citizenship and prevent "hard-earned dollars" from being "siphoned away" to finance the "direct and downstream costs" associated with birth tourism. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant. The "birth tourism" industry, which is deemed "lucrative" and "criminal," has evolved to facilitate this practice, and the new rules aim to eliminate it. END OF SUMMARY.
