Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. They want a summary that includes the morally charged words from the article.

First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "restricting," "abuses," "national security risks," "defend," "siphoned," "integrity," "loophole," "endemic," "plague," "vulnerable," "crackdown," "lucrative," "criminal activity," "scheme," and "lied." These words are used to frame the issue in a negative light, emphasizing problems and the need for action.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and highlight the administration's actions, the moral justifications, and the criticisms. I'll start by mentioning the new visa rules, the purpose behind them, the moral arguments like protecting citizenship integrity and preventing financial exploitation. I'll also note the criticism about potential risks to pregnant women and the industry's profitability.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the policy, its rationale, the administration's stance, and then the counterarguments. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original framing. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure U.S. citizenship for their children. Under the rules, applicants seeking tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine their primary purpose is giving birth. Those with medical needs must prove they can cover all expenses, including transportation and living costs. The administration frames the policy as closing a "glaring immigration loophole" to combat "endemic abuses," protect "national security risks," and prevent "American taxpayers" from being "siphoned" to fund the practice. Critics argue the rules could put pregnant women at risk, as consular officers cannot explicitly ask about pregnancy but must still assess intent. The "birth tourism" industry, which charges up to $80,000, has been targeted by the U.S. for its "criminal activity" and "schemes" involving visa fraud. The policy aims to uphold the "integrity" of U.S. citizenship, though legal challenges remain.
