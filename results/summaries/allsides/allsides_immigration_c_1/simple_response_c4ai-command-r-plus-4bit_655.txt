SUMMARY: The Trump administration has taken a stand against "birth tourism," a practice where women travel to the United States to give birth, ensuring their children gain citizenship. The new visa rules, published in the Federal Register, aim to restrict this practice by denying tourist visas to applicants who are deemed to be primarily coming to the US to give birth. This change comes as the administration continues to crack down on all forms of immigration, with a particular focus on birthright citizenship.

The State Department believes that birth tourism is not a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation and that it undermines the integrity of American citizenship. The new rules will make it harder for pregnant women to obtain tourist visas, requiring them to prove they have the financial means to cover medical, transportation, and living expenses. This policy shift raises concerns about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and the potential risks it may pose to pregnant women.

Critics argue that this policy could endanger pregnant women, and it is challenging to determine pregnancy during a visa interview. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the process, often attracting women from Russia and China. While the exact numbers are unknown, it is believed that thousands of women engage in birth tourism annually. The administration justifies its actions by citing criminal activity and national security risks associated with this practice.
