SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "endemic abuses" of "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules aim to protect the "integrity of American citizenship" and prevent "hard-earned dollars" from being "siphoned away" to finance the costs associated with birth tourism. The practice is considered "illegitimate" and a "glaring immigration loophole." The administration has been cracking down on all forms of immigration, and this move is part of a broader effort to restrict immigration. Critics argue that the new policy could put pregnant women at risk, but the administration claims it will "eliminate the criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry." The rules take effect Friday, and applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are deemed to be coming to the US primarily to give birth. END OF SUMMARY.
