SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are suspected of coming to the US primarily to give birth. The rules require proof of a medical need and the ability to pay for treatment, including transportation and living expenses. The administration claims this will combat "endemic abuses" and protect American taxpayers from financing the costs associated with birth tourism. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine whether a woman is pregnant. The practice of birth tourism is considered a lucrative business, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the process. The administration's move is part of a broader crackdown on immigration, with President Trump having previously railed against birthright citizenship.
