SUMMARY: The Trump administration published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the United States to give birth so their children can have U.S. citizenship. Consular officers will deny tourist visas to applicants determined to be coming to the U.S. primarily to give birth. This creates a bigger hurdle for pregnant women, who now have to prove they have the money to pay for medical treatment, transportation, and living expenses. The White House press secretary defended the move, stating that it would protect the integrity of American citizenship and defend taxpayers from financing birth tourism. While the practice is fundamentally legal, there have been scattered cases of authorities arresting operators of birth tourism agencies for fraud and evasion. The State Department does not believe birth tourism is a legitimate activity for pleasure or recreation. The new rules specifically target birth tourism, but the administration has also turned away pregnant women seeking asylum at the border. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questionable determinations by border officers. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice. The U.S. has been cracking down on this industry, which involves foreign nationals lying about their trip duration and purpose to obtain U.S. citizenship for their children. END OF SUMMARY.
