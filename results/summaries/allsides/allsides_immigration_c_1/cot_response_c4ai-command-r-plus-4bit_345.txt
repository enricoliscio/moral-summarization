SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has taken steps to restrict "birth tourism," a practice where women travel to the U.S. specifically to give birth, ensuring their children gain U.S. citizenship. The new visa rules, published in the Federal Register, aim to curb this practice by denying tourist visas to applicants deemed to be primarily seeking birth tourism. This shift places a greater burden of proof on pregnant applicants, requiring them to demonstrate a legitimate medical need and sufficient financial resources for their trip. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham defended the move, stating that it protects American taxpayers and the integrity of U.S. citizenship from endemic abuses associated with birth tourism. While the practice is fundamentally legal, authorities have occasionally arrested operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud and tax evasion. The State Department considers birth tourism an illegitimated activity for pleasure or recreation, and the administration's move aligns with broader efforts to restrict immigration and birthright citizenship. Critics argue that the policy could endanger pregnant women, and there are concerns about how officers would determine pregnancy status. The lucrative birth tourism industry facilitates this practice through advertisements and charging exorbitant fees. The U.S. has been cracking down on this industry, with the State Department acknowledging the criminal activity and schemes associated with it.
