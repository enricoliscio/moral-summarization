Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Trump administration introducing new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism." Birth tourism is when women come to the U.S. to give birth so their children can get U.S. citizenship. 

The new rules state that tourist visas will be denied if the primary purpose is to give birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and the funds to cover all expenses, including living and transportation. The White House press secretary mentions protecting national security and taxpayers, emphasizing the importance of citizenship integrity.

The article also mentions that birth tourism is technically legal, but there are cases of visa fraud. The State Department views birth tourism as not a legitimate recreational activity. The administration is targeting not just visa applicants but also pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border. Critics argue this could risk pregnant women's safety and question how officers will determine pregnancy intentions.

Additionally, the article notes that birth tourism is a profitable industry, especially for women from Russia and China. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates around 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S. in 2012. The rules aim to eliminate criminal activities linked to birth tourism, referencing federal indictments where visa applicants lied about their travel purposes.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects intact. I should highlight the new visa restrictions, the administration's reasoning (protecting citizenship integrity, national security, taxpayers), the criticism, and the industry's profitability. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the rule, the reasoning, the criticism, and the industry context.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all key points without being too detailed. I'll make sure to mention the opposition and the ethical concerns, as well as the legal and practical challenges the rules pose.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if consular officers determine the primary purpose is childbirth. Applicants must prove a medical need and financial ability to cover all expenses. The administration claims this will protect national security, taxpayer funds, and citizenship integrity. Critics argue the policy risks pregnant women's safety and raises concerns about how officers will assess pregnancy intentions. Birth tourism, while legal, is a lucrative industry, with some estimating 36,000 foreign-born women giving birth in the U.S. annually. The rules aim to eliminate fraud and lies in visa applications but face ethical and practical challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
