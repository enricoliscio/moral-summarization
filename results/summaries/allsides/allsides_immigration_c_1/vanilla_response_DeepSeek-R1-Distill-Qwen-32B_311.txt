Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Trump administration's new visa rules targeting birth tourism. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the Trump administration published new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women come to the U.S. to give birth so their children can get citizenship. The rules state that tourist visas will be denied if the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need, not just a desire for citizenship. They also need to show they can cover all expenses, including medical, transportation, and living costs.

The summary should include the main elements: who is affected, what the new rules are, the reasoning behind them, and any criticisms or context. I should mention the White House's stance on protecting citizenship integrity and taxpayer money. Also, note that birth tourism is technically legal but has some illegal cases. The rules take effect Friday and target those whose main purpose is to obtain citizenship through birth.

I should also touch on the broader immigration policies, like turning away pregnant women at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the challenges in determining pregnancy during visa interviews. Critics worry about risks to pregnant women and the lucrative nature of the birth tourism industry, especially from Russia and China.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure the summary to cover these points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to curb "birth tourism," where foreign women travel to the U.S. to give birth, granting their children U.S. citizenship. Under the rules, tourist visas will be denied if the primary purpose is giving birth. Applicants must prove they have a medical need and can cover all related expenses. The administration aims to protect U.S. citizenship integrity and taxpayer funds, as birth tourism is seen as an abuse. While the practice is legal, it has faced scrutiny due to cases of visa fraud and tax evasion. The new policy, effective Friday, treats birth tourism as non-legitimate for tourist visas. Critics argue the rules may put pregnant women at risk, as consular officers cannot inquire about pregnancy but must assess intent. Birth tourism is a lucrative industry, with companies charging up to $80,000. The U.S. has been cracking down on the practice, though it remains unclear how many foreign women come to the U.S. for this purpose. END OF SUMMARY.
