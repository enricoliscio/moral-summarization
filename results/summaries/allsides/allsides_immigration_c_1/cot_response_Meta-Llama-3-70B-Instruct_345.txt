SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," a practice deemed "illegitimate" and "abusive" by the White House. The rules aim to restrict women from traveling to the US primarily to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. Applicants will be denied tourist visas if consular officers determine they are coming to the US for this purpose. The administration claims this "loophole" must be closed to "protect" American taxpayers and national security. Critics argue the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raise questions about how officers will determine a woman's intentions. The "birth tourism" industry, deemed "lucrative" and "criminal," has been operating in the US and abroad, with companies charging up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice. The new rules aim to "eliminate" this industry and its associated "abuses." END OF SUMMARY.
