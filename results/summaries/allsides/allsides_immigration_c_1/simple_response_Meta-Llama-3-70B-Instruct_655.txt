SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has introduced new visa rules to combat "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth and obtain US citizenship for their children. The rules require applicants to prove they are traveling to the US for medical needs, not just to give birth, and must demonstrate they have the financial means to pay for their stay. The administration claims this will protect American taxpayers and national security, as well as preserve the integrity of US citizenship. Critics argue that the policy could put pregnant women at risk and raises questions about how officers will determine a woman's intentions. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, with President Trump having previously expressed concerns about birthright citizenship. The new rules take effect Friday and aim to eliminate the "criminal activity" associated with the birth tourism industry.

END OF SUMMARY.
