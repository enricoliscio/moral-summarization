SUMMARY: The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting "birth tourism," where women travel to the US to give birth to gain citizenship for their children. Consular officers can now deny tourist visas if they believe the primary purpose of the trip is to give birth in the US. This change in policy raises ethical concerns about how officers will determine if a woman is pregnant and the potential for discrimination based on appearance. The administration justifies these measures by claiming to protect national security and taxpayer interests. Critics argue that it puts pregnant women at risk and raises questions about the legality and morality of restricting birthright citizenship. The State Department considers birth tourism as not being "a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature." The birth tourism industry raises concerns about criminal activity and visa fraud, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services. While the exact number of cases is unknown, an estimate suggests that in 2012, about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the US and then left. These new rules add to the broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration and highlight the ongoing debate surrounding birthright citizenship in the US.
