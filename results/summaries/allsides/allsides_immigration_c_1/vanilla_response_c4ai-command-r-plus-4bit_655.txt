SUMMARY: The Trump administration published new visa rules to restrict "birth tourism," where women travel to the U.S. to give birth, granting their children automatic citizenship. Consular officers can now deny tourist visas if they believe the primary purpose of the visit is to give birth in the U.S. Women with medical needs must prove they have the financial means to cover their expenses. The White House defended the decision, citing national security risks and financial costs to taxpayers. While the practice is legal, authorities have arrested operators of birth tourism agencies for fraud and tax evasion. The new rules do not allow consular officers to inquire about pregnancy but task them with determining if the visa's primary purpose is birth tourism. The birth tourism industry is lucrative, with companies charging up to $80,000 for their services, targeting women from Russia and China. The State Department estimates that in 2012, about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the U.S. and then left. The new rules aim to eliminate criminal activity associated with birth tourism and protect the integrity of American citizenship.
