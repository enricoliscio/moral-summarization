SUMMARY:
The U.S. is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a record-breaking spike of over 47,000 new infections in a single day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warns that this number could double to 100,000 unless urgent action is taken. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are witnessing alarming increases in cases and hospitalizations, with intensive care beds in short supply. The failure to control the pandemic has prompted criticism of President Donald Trump, with his rival Joe Biden blaming Trump's "historic mismanagement" for the unnecessary damage to both public health and the economy. Biden's plan emphasizes more testing and contact tracing. Health experts are worried about the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, fearing they could further fuel the surge in cases. Dr. Fauci expresses *concern* about the situation, stating that the nation is "not in total control." The European Union has excluded Americans from its safe travel list, underscoring the gravity of the situation. This rise in cases highlights the *responsibility* of leaders to act swiftly and effectively to protect their citizens from harm.
