SUMMARY:
The United States witnessed its largest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic's onset, with over 47,000 new infections reported on Tuesday. This surge has brought forth intense criticism of President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis, with his rival Joe Biden condemning Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic. Biden asserted that Trump's failure has led to unnecessary economic damage and loss of lives.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase in cases could reach a staggering 100,000 unless urgent action is taken nationwide. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are grappling with record increases, prompting the closure of recently reopened bars. Hospital beds in these states are in short supply, and the upcoming Independence Day celebrations have experts worried about further spikes. 

The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for travel, underscoring the severity of the situation in the U.S. Biden has proposed an updated plan to combat the pandemic, calling for expanded testing and the hiring of 100,000 contact tracers. The moral failings in the response to the pandemic have resulted in devastating consequences for Americans' health and livelihoods.
