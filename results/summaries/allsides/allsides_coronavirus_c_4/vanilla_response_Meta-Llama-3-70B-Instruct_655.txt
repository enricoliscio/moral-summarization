SUMMARY: 

The US has seen a record one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters of the pandemic, with record increases in COVID-19 cases. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could get very bad, and that there is no guarantee of a vaccine. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries, citing the surge in cases. The development has led to renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy.
