SUMMARY: U.S. COVID-19 cases rose by over 47,000 on Tuesday, the biggest one-day spike since the pandemic began, with Dr. Anthony Fauci warning that this number could double. States like California, Texas, and Arizona are seeing record increases, and hospital beds are in short supply. Fauci stressed the need for a nationwide push to control the virus and highlighted the uncertainty of a vaccine, with the potential for doses by early next year. The surge in cases has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic. Democrat Joe Biden blamed Trump for the economic damage and loss of lives, presenting his own plan to tackle COVID-19. States like California, Texas, and Florida have moved to close bars again, and New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are requiring travelers from hotspot states to self-quarantine. The upcoming Independence Day celebrations have raised concerns about further spread, with hospitals in Houston already nearing capacity. END OF SUMMARY.
