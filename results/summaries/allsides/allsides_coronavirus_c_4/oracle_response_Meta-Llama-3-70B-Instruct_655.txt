SUMMARY: The US has seen a record one-day spike in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday, sparking concerns that the number could soon double. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the country is "not in total control" of the pandemic, and that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide push is made to "tamp down" the resurgent virus. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could "get very bad" and put the entire country at "risk". The surge in cases has been attributed to the reopening of bars, with California, Texas, and Florida emerging as new epicenters of the pandemic. Critics have blamed President Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic, which has "cost" lives and "inflicted" damage on the economy. Trump's rival, Joe Biden, has unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic, calling for more testing and the hiring of 100,000 contract tracers, saying "it didn't have to be this way. Donald Trump failed us." END OF SUMMARY.
