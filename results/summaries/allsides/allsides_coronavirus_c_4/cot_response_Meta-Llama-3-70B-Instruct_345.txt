SUMMARY:
The US has reported a record one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases, sparking concern from Dr. Anthony Fauci, who warned that the number could soon double. Fauci expressed his concern, stating that the country is "not in total control" and that the situation could "get very bad" unless a nationwide effort is made to combat the virus. He criticized the lack of control, saying it "puts the entire country at risk." The resurgence of the virus has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has "cost" lives and "inflicted" unnecessary damage to the economy. The situation is particularly dire in California, Texas, and Arizona, where hospital beds are in short supply. The alarming rise in cases has also led to travel restrictions, with the European Union excluding Americans from its "safe list." END OF SUMMARY.
