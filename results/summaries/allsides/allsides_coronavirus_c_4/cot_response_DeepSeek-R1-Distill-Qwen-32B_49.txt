Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the COVID-19 situation in the US and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the task. They want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to summarize the article while preserving those moral framings. 

I should start by reading the article carefully. It talks about the rise in COVID cases, states becoming epicenters, experts' warnings, the economic impact, criticism of the president, and the call for more testing and tracing. 

For step one, I need to extract words that carry moral connotations. Words like "failed," "mismanagement," "scared," "flock," and "cratered" stand out because they imply blame, fear, or negative outcomes. 

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping these words to maintain the moral framing. I should mention the surge in cases, the experts' concerns, the economic impact, Trump's criticism, Biden's plan, and the closure of bars. I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally while including those moral terms.

I should also make sure to structure the response with STEP 1 and SUMMARY sections as specified. I need to be careful not to miss any morally framed words and include them appropriately in the summary without making it sound forced.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the key points and maintains the moral perspective from the original article.

**STEP 1:**  
* failed  
* mismanagement  
* scared  
* flock  
* cratered  

**SUMMARY:**  
New U.S. COVID-19 cases surged by over 47,000, the highest since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona as new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that daily cases could double to 100,000 unless containment measures are implemented nationwide. He expressed concern about the lack of control and the potential for severe consequences. The U.S. economy has cratered, and over 126,000 deaths have been reported. Critics, including Joe Biden, argue that President Trump's historic mismanagement has cost lives and worsened the economic crisis. States like Texas and Florida have closed bars to curb spikes, while New York and others require self-quarantine for travelers from high-risk states. Hospitals in Texas are struggling with bed shortages, and Fauci warned that Independence Day celebrations could exacerbate the situation, stating, "Frankly, it scares me." END OF SUMMARY.
