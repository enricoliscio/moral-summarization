SUMMARY: The US has reported its largest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with over 47,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the number could soon double unless a nationwide effort is made to tamp down the resurgent virus. Fauci expressed concern that the country is not in total control, and that the situation could get very bad. He emphasized that the entire country is at risk, not just the areas currently experiencing surges. The recent spike has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage to the economy. Biden unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic, calling for more testing and the hiring of 100,000 contract tracers. As cases continue to rise, states are taking measures to close recently reopened bars and impose travel restrictions to mitigate the risk. END OF SUMMARY.
