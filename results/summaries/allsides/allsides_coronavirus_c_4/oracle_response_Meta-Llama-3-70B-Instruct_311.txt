SUMMARY:

The US has reported its largest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with over 47,000 new cases on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the number could soon double unless a nationwide effort is made to tamp down the resurgent virus. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could get very bad, putting the entire country at risk. The surge in cases has led to a shortage of hospital intensive care beds in parts of Texas and Arizona. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries, citing the failed response to the pandemic. Democrat Joe Biden criticized President Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic, saying it has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage to the economy. Biden unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic, calling for more testing and hiring of contract tracers. The situation has dimmed hopes that the worst of the human and economic pain had passed.
