SUMMARY: COVID-19 cases in the U.S. saw a record spike on Tuesday with over 47,000 new infections reported, according to a Reuters tally. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the daily increase could reach 100,000 if efforts are not made to control the virus nationwide. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters, with Texas reporting a one-day record of nearly 7,000 cases on Tuesday. Hospital beds are quickly filling up in these states, with intensive care beds in short supply. The surge in cases has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden blaming the administration's "historic mismanagement" for the economic damage and loss of lives. Biden unveiled an updated plan to tackle COVID-19, calling for increased testing and hiring of contact tracers. The rise in cases has also prompted some states to reimpose restrictions, with California, Texas, and Florida closing recently reopened bars. Experts fear that the upcoming Independence Day celebrations could further worsen the situation.
END OF SUMMARY.
