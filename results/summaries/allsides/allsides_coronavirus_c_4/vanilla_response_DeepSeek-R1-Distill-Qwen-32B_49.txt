Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with over 47,000 new cases in one day, the highest since the pandemic began. Dr. Fauci is warning that this number could double unless there's a nationwide effort to control the virus. States like California, Texas, and Arizona are new epicenters, and hospital ICUs are getting overwhelmed. 

There's also mention of the economic impact, with over 126,000 deaths and millions losing jobs. The EU is excluding the U.S. from its safe travel list. Politically, Trump is being criticized for mismanagement, and Biden is proposing more testing and contact tracing. States are closing bars again, and some regions are imposing quarantines for travelers from affected states. Doctors are worried about the upcoming Independence Day celebrations leading to more cases.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key points: the rise in cases, Fauci's warning, new epicenters, hospital shortages, economic impact, EU travel ban, political criticism, state actions, and concerns about future spread. I should structure it clearly, starting with the main issue, then the consequences, and the responses from officials and states.
