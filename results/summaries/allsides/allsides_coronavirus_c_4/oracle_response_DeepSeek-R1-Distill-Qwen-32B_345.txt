Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should keep the morally framed words they've identified. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points and the moral implications.

The article talks about a surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with new highs and states becoming epicenters. Dr. Fauci is warning about the situation getting worse unless measures are taken. There's criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic, and Biden is pointing out the failures. The economy is suffering, and there's a call for more testing and tracing.

The user wants a summary that includes words like "get," "tamp," "risk," "failed," "mismanagement," "cost," "inflicted," and "close." I need to make sure these words are included naturally in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main points: surge in cases, Fauci's warning, states becoming epicenters, criticism of Trump, Biden's plan, states closing bars, and concerns aboutIndependence Day celebrations.

Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms. I'll mention Fauci's warning about the risk of cases doubling, the failure of Trump's management, the cost in lives and economy, states closing bars, and the potential for things to get worse if not tamped down.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear. Let me piece it together, ensuring each key point is covered with the specified words.

SUMMARY:  
New U.S. COVID-19 cases surged by over 47,000, the highest daily increase since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that cases could soon double, emphasizing the need to tamp down the virus nationwide. He expressed concern that the situation could get very bad, with daily cases potentially reaching 100,000. Fauci also cautioned that a vaccine is not guaranteed, though early data is promising.  

The resurgence has led to criticism of President Donald Trumpâ€™s handling of the pandemic, with his rival, Joe Biden, accusing him of historic mismanagement that cost lives and inflicted unnecessary economic damage. States like California, Texas, and Florida have closed recently reopened bars, while New York and others have imposed quarantine requirements for travelers from affected states.  

Hospital beds in Texas and Arizona are in short supply, and Dr. Marc Boom of Houston Methodist Hospital warned that Independence Day celebrations could worsen the crisis. Fauci stressed that the virus poses a risk to the entire country, urging collective action to prevent further escalation. END OF SUMMARY.
