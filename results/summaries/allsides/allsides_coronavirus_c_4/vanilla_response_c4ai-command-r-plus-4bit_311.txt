SUMMARY: On Tuesday, the United States saw a record-breaking surge in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 infections reported in a single day. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the daily increase could reach 100,000 if nationwide efforts are not made to control the spread. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida have emerged as new epicenters, reporting record increases and straining hospital resources. The spike in cases has prompted criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic ahead of the November election. Democrat Joe Biden blamed Trump for the economic damage and loss of lives caused by the pandemic. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for travel, reflecting the country's struggle to contain the virus. The recent rise in cases has dampened hopes of recovery and highlights the urgent need for effective measures to combat the pandemic.
