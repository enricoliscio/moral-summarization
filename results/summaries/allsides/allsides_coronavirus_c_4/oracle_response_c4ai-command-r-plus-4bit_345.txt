SUMMARY: The United States is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a record-breaking spike of over 47,000 new infections in a single day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warns that this number could double to 100,000 unless urgent action is taken to tamp down the virus's spread. The states of California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters, with hospitals in some areas already facing shortages of intensive care beds. This surge in cases has renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing Trump of historic mismanagement that has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy. Biden's updated plan for tackling the pandemic calls for increased testing and the hiring of 100,000 contact tracers. The rising cases have also prompted several states, including California, Texas, and Florida, to re-close bars and impose self-quarantine measures for travelers from high-risk areas. This worrying trend risks derailing the country's economic recovery and highlights the Trump administration's failed response to the crisis.
