SUMMARY: The United States saw a record-breaking spike in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new infections reported on Tuesday alone. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that this number could double unless aggressive action is taken nationwide to tamp down the virus's spread. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations, with some hospitals already running short on ICU beds. The spike in cases has renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing Trump of failing the country and causing unnecessary damage to both public health and the economy through his mismanagement of the crisis. The fresh wave of infections has forced some states to reimpose restrictions on businesses, with bars being closed once again in several states. Dr. Marc Boom of Houston Methodist Hospital expressed concern over the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, fearing a further spike in cases. The European Union has also excluded Americans from its "safe list" for non-essential travel. The US now faces the dual challenge of containing the virus and mitigating the economic fallout, with millions of jobs lost and a sharp contraction in the economy. Fauci warned that the daily case count could reach 100,000 if the country fails to act decisively.
END OF SUMMARY.
