SUMMARY: The United States saw a record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, with over 47,000 new infections reported, according to a Reuters tally. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that this number could double if nationwide efforts are not made to control the spread. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters, with Texas reporting a one-day record of nearly 7,000 cases. Fauci expressed concern that the daily increase could reach 100,000 without immediate action. The rise in cases has sparked criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with rival Joe Biden blaming the administration for the economic damage and loss of lives. Hospitals in Texas and Arizona are facing shortages of intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients, and experts worry that upcoming Independence Day celebrations could further worsen the situation. Fauci also provided an update on vaccine development, stating that early data is promising and doses could be available by early 2021.
END OF SUMMARY.
