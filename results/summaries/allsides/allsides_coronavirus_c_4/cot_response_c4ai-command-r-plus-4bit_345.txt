STEP 1:
*Failed*
*Mismanagement*
*Damage*
*Scares*

SUMMARY:
The United States witnessed a record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new infections reported on Tuesday alone. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase could double to 100,000 unless urgent action is taken nationwide. California, Texas, Arizona, and other states are grappling with alarming spikes in cases, overwhelming hospitals and threatening to reverse hard-won gains. The pandemic has laid bare the *failed* leadership of President Donald Trump, whose *mismanagement* has exacerbated the crisis, according to his rival Joe Biden. Biden's plan calls for increased testing and contact tracing to curb the virus's spread. With the July 4th weekend approaching, health experts fear further escalation as Americans gather for celebrations. Dr. Fauci cautioned that the U.S. is "not in total control," underscoring the urgent need for a coordinated response to protect both lives and the economy from further *damage*.
