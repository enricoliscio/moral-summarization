Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The article talks about a surge in COVID-19 cases in the US, with new highs in states like California, Texas, and Arizona. Dr. Fauci is warning about the situation getting worse unless measures are taken. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included: get, tamp, risk, failed, mismanagement, cost, inflicted, close.

I should start by identifying the main events and the moral implications. The surge in cases is a critical issue, so using 'get' as in "getting worse" makes sense. Fauci's warning about the number doubling ties into 'tamp' as in efforts to tamp down the virus. The risk to the entire country is another moral point. 

The article mentions criticism of Trump's handling, so 'failed' and'mismanagement' are crucial. Biden's statement about the cost in lives and economic damage fits well. The closing of bars and travel restrictions are examples of 'close' being used in a moral context.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those words as possible. I'll structure it by first mentioning the surge and Fauci's warning, then the states affected, the risks, Trump's failure, Biden's criticism, the impact on the economy, and the measures taken like closing bars and travel restrictions. I'll make sure each moral word is naturally integrated without forcing them in.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the increase in cases, mention Fauci's warning about doubling. Then the epicenters and the risk to the country. Next, the criticism of Trump's mismanagement and the cost in lives and economy. Include the states closing bars and the travel restrictions. Conclude with Fauci's concern about celebrations worsening the situation.

I think this covers all the key points and includes the moral words appropriately. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. It looks good, around 180 words. I'll make sure the summary flows well and each sentence connects logically to the next.

SUMMARY: U.S. COVID-19 cases surged by over 47,000, the highest daily increase since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned the number could double unless efforts to tamp down the virus were made nationwide, emphasizing the risk to the entire country. He expressed concern over the potential for 100,000 daily cases and criticized the lack of control, calling the situation "very bad." The surge has dimmed hopes of recovery, with over 126,000 deaths and millions losing jobs. President Trump has faced criticism for his mismanagement, with Joe Biden accusing him of failing the country and costing lives. States like Texas and Florida have closed bars to curb the spread, while New York and others have imposed travel restrictions. Fauci warned that without action, the situation could get worse, particularly with upcoming Independence Day celebrations. END OF SUMMARY.
