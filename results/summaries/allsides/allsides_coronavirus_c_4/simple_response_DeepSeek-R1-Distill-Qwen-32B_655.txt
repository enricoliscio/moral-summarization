Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about a surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with over 47,000 new cases on Tuesday, the highest since the pandemic started. Dr. Fauci warns it could double. States like California, Texas, and Arizona are new epicenters. He emphasizes the need for a nationwide approach, not just focusing on surge areas. There's mention of the EU excluding the U.S. from their safe list, which reflects on the country's handling. Trump is criticized for mismanagement, and Biden is offering a plan. Hospitals in Texas are struggling, and there's concern about July 4th gatherings.

I need to capture the key points: rising cases, Fauci's warning, states affected, economic impact, criticism of Trump, Biden's plan, and hospital concerns. The moral aspect is the failure in leadership and the human cost. I should structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the spike, mention Fauci's warning, the new epicenters, the EU exclusion, Trump's criticism, Biden's plan, and the hospital situation. End with the July 4th concern. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral critique. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Looks good. Time to put it all together.

The European Union excluded the U.S. from its "safe list" for travel, reflecting the nation's struggle to contain the outbreak. Criticism of President Trump's pandemic response has intensified, with Democratic rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" and unveiling a new plan to expand testing and tracing.

END OF SUMMARY.
