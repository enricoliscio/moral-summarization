SUMMARY:
The US has seen a record-breaking one-day spike in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the number could soon double, stating that "Clearly we are not in total control right now" and that he is "very concerned because it could get very bad." Fauci's concerns are amplified by the fact that hospital intensive care beds are in short supply in parts of Texas and Arizona. The resurgence of the virus has prompted renewed criticism of President Donald Trump, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic, which has "failed" the US and cost lives. The situation is "scary" as the country heads into Independence Day celebrations, with experts warning of further spikes. END OF SUMMARY.
