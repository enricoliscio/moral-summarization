SUMMARY: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that new U.S. COVID-19 cases could soon double, reaching 100,000 per day if urgent action is not taken to control the virus's spread. This warning comes as California, Texas, and Arizona report record increases in cases, overwhelming hospitals and leading to a shortage of intensive care beds. The surge in cases has been attributed in part to the reopening of bars and social gatherings, with Dr. Fauci emphasizing the need for a nationwide effort to tackle the pandemic. The economic impact of the pandemic continues to be devastating, with millions of job losses and a sharp contraction in the economy. As a result, the EU has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for travel. President Trump's handling of the crisis has been criticized by his rival Joe Biden, who blames Trump for the unnecessary damage to the economy and the loss of lives. The situation is dire, and the future remains uncertain as the country braces for a challenging Independence Day weekend, with the potential for further spikes in cases. END OF SUMMARY.
