SUMMARY: The United States is facing a devastating surge in COVID-19 cases, with a single-day spike of 47,000 new infections, and Dr. Anthony Fauci warning that this number could double if urgent action is not taken. The failure to control the pandemic has resulted in devastating consequences, with over 126,000 deaths and severe economic damage. The blame for this tragedy lies squarely with President Donald Trump, whose mismanagement has cost countless lives and caused unnecessary economic harm. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are now grappling with record increases, and hospitals are struggling to cope. Dr. Fauci warns that a nationwide push is needed to prevent further catastrophe, yet Trump's administration has failed to provide the necessary leadership and coordination. The European Union has even excluded Americans from traveling to the bloc, a stark indication of the country's failure to contain the virus. This Independence Day, Americans are faced with the grim reality of a pandemic that rages on due to the moral failure of their leadership. 

END OF SUMMARY.
