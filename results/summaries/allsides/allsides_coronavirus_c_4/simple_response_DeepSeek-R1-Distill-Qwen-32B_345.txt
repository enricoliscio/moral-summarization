Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary should not only be concise but also highlight the ethical and political implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main points are the surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with states like California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. Dr. Fauci's warnings about the potential doubling of cases and the need for a nationwide effort are crucial. The economic impact is significant, with over 126,000 deaths and job losses. There's also political criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic, with Biden blaming Trump's mismanagement.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved. This means highlighting the failure in leadership and the consequences on public health and the economy. I should mention the political implications, especially the criticism towards Trump, as it's part of the author's moral stance.

I'll structure the summary to first state the surge in cases, mention the states affected, Fauci's concerns, the lack of control, the potential for worse outcomes, and the economic impact. Then, I'll address the political aspect, including Trump's exclusion from the EU's safe list and Biden's criticism. Finally, I'll note the measures taken by states and Fauci's concerns about celebrations.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include all critical points. I'll make sure to mention the moral implications, such as the failure in leadership and the preventable damage to lives and the economy.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all necessary elements while adhering to the word limit.

SUMMARY: U.S. COVID-19 cases surged by over 47,000 on Tuesday, the highest daily increase since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that cases could double unless nationwide measures are taken, emphasizing the risk to the entire country. States like Texas and Florida have closed reopened bars, while New York and others have imposed quarantines for travelers from affected states. Over 126,000 Americans have died, and the economy has suffered severe contraction. Amid rising criticism of President Trump’s pandemic response, Democratic rival Joe Biden accused him of “historic mismanagement,” claiming the situation could have been avoided. Fauci also cautioned about the potential failure of a vaccine and the risks posed by upcoming Independence Day celebrations. The EU has excluded the U.S. from its “safe list” for travel, reflecting the country’s struggling containment efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
