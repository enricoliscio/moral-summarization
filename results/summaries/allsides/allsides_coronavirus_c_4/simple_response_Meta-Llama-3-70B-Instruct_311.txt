SUMMARY:

The US has reported a record-breaking 47,000 new COVID-19 cases in a single day, with California, Texas, and Arizona emerging as new epicenters of the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could get "very bad" and emphasized that the entire country is at risk. The surge in cases has led to criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy. The situation is particularly dire in Texas and Arizona, where hospital intensive care beds are in short supply. The moral imperative is clear: the government must take immediate action to control the spread of the virus and protect the lives of its citizens.
