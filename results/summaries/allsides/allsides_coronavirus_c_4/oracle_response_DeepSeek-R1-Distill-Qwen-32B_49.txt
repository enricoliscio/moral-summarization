Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about a surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with over 47,000 new cases on Tuesday, the highest since the pandemic started. Dr. Fauci warns it could double, and states like California, Texas, and Arizona are new epicenters. He's concerned because the situation is getting bad, and without a nationwide effort, cases might reach 100,000 daily. He mentions the risk of not controlling the virus and the possibility of a vaccine, but it's not guaranteed.

States like Texas and Florida have had to close bars again, and some regions are requiring quarantines. There's criticism of Trump's handling, with Biden calling it a failure and mismanagement. The economic impact is also significant, with over 126,000 deaths and job losses. Fauci warns about the upcoming celebrations potentially worsening the situation.

Now, I need to make sure to include the moral words: get, tamp, risk, failed, mismanagement, cost, inflicted, close. I'll structure the summary to highlight the surge, Fauci's warnings, the states affected, the closure of bars, Trump's failure, the economic impact, and the risk of future spikes.

I should start with the surge, mention Fauci's concerns, the states, the closures, the criticism of Trump, the economic costs, and the potential risks from celebrations. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the moral words are included naturally.
