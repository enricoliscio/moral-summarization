SUMMARY:
The US has seen a record-breaking spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday, sparking concern from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert. Fauci warned that the number could soon double, and that the country is "not in total control" of the pandemic. He expressed concern that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide push is made to contain the virus. The surge in cases has led to renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden stating that Trump "failed us" and that his actions have cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage to the economy. The situation is dire, with hospital beds in short supply in parts of Texas and Arizona, and experts warning that Independence Day celebrations could further exacerbate the crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
