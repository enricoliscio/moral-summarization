SUMMARY: The US has reported its biggest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, with over 47,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the number could soon double unless a nationwide push is made to tamp down the resurgent virus, putting the entire country at risk. The government's top infectious disease expert expressed concern that the situation could get very bad. The fresh rise in cases and hospitalizations has dimmed hopes that the worst of the human and economic pain had passed, prompting renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's historic mismanagement of the pandemic, which has cost lives and inflicted more damage than necessary to the US economy. Trump's rival, Joe Biden, said that Trump failed us, and unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic. Several states have moved to close recently reopened bars, which are believed to be a major contributor to the recent spikes. END OF SUMMARY.
