Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the underlying messages.

The article talks about a significant rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with over 47,000 new cases in a day, the highest since the pandemic started. States like California, Texas, and Arizona are becoming new epicenters. Dr. Fauci is warning that the numbers could double unless there's a nationwide effort to control the spread. He also mentions the possibility of a vaccine but isn't certain, hoping for availability by next year. The economic impact is severe, with millions losing jobs and the economy contracting. The EU has excluded the U.S. from their safe travel list, which adds to the criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic. Biden is criticizing Trump, saying his mismanagement cost lives and hurt the economy. States like Texas and Florida are closing bars again, and some areas are enforcing quarantines. Hospitals are filling up, and there's concern about upcoming celebrations like Independence Day leading to more spread.

Now, the moral framing seems to be around the failure of leadership, specifically Trump's handling, leading to increased cases and economic damage. There's also a focus on the human cost, with hospitals overwhelmed and the potential for more deaths. The article also touches on the importance of collective action and the consequences of not taking the pandemic seriously, especially with events like Independence Day.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements. It should mention the rising cases, the states affected, Fauci's warnings, the vaccine uncertainty, the economic impact, Trump's criticism, Biden's response, the measures taken by states, and the concerns about future spread. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with the surge in cases, mention the epicenters, Fauci's concerns, the possible doubling of cases, the vaccine hope, the economic impact, the EU's travel ban, the criticism of Trump, Biden's criticism, the states' actions, hospital conditions, and the concern over celebrations.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within limits. I'll make sure each point is concise but clear, preserving the moral elements of leadership failure and the human cost.
