SUMMARY: The United States is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a record-breaking spike of over 47,000 new infections in a single day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert, warned that this number could double to 100,000 unless urgent action is taken nationwide to tamp down the virus. States like California, Texas, and Arizona have become new epicenters, with hospital beds in short supply. The failure to control the pandemic has prompted criticism of President Donald Trump, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of historic mismanagement that has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary economic damage. The EU has excluded Americans from its safe travel list, and states like California, Texas, and Florida have been forced to close bars and other businesses again. Dr. Marc Boom of Houston Methodist Hospital expressed concern about the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, fearing a further spike in cases. The mismanagement of the pandemic has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy, revealing a failure of leadership and a disregard for the well-being of Americans.
