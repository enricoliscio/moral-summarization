Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer. They provided a news article from Reuters about the surge in COVID-19 cases in the US. My task is to summarize this article concisely, within 200 words, and format it with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article mentions that new COVID-19 cases in the US reached over 47,000 in a single day, which is the highest since the pandemic began. Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning that this number could double unless measures are taken. California, Texas, and Arizona are new epicenters with record increases. Fauci emphasizes the need for a nationwide effort, not just focusing on the worst-hit areas. He also talks about the possibility of a vaccine, though it's not guaranteed, with hopes for availability by early next year.

Additionally, the article notes that cases doubled in June in at least 10 states, including Texas and Florida, leading to shortages in ICU beds. The economic impact is significant, with over 126,000 deaths and millions losing jobs. The EU has excluded the US from their safe travel list, and there's political criticism, especially towards Trump, with Biden blaming his mismanagement.

I should structure the summary to include these key points: the surge in cases, the states affected, Fauci's warnings, the impact on hospitals, the economic effects, the EU travel ban, and the political implications. I need to make sure it's concise and under 200 words, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

I'll start by stating the main increase in cases, mention the states, Fauci's concerns, the potential doubling of cases, the need for a nationwide approach, the vaccine hope, the states with doubled cases, ICU shortages, the death toll and economic impact, the EU exclusion, political criticism, and the renewed lockdown measures. I'll also include Fauci's concern about upcoming celebrations potentially worsening the situation.

I should ensure that each sentence is clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: U.S. COVID-19 cases surged by over 47,000 in a single day, the highest since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona as new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned the daily case count could double to 100,000 unless nationwide measures are taken. He emphasized the need for a coordinated effort, as the virus resurgence risks overwhelming the entire country. Fauci expressed hope for a vaccine by early 2021 but cautioned it’s not guaranteed. June saw cases more than double in at least 10 states, with ICU beds in Texas and Arizona in short supply. The U.S. has over 126,000 COVID-19 deaths, and the economic impact has been severe. The EU has excluded the U.S. from its safe travel list, reigniting criticism of President Trump’s pandemic response. Biden accused Trump of mismanaging the crisis, costing lives and economic damage. States like California, Texas, and Florida have closed bars, while New York and others have imposed quarantines for travelers from high-risk states. Texas reported a record 6,975 new cases, with hospitals struggling to keep up. Fauci warned that Independence Day celebrations could worsen the outbreak. END OF SUMMARY.
