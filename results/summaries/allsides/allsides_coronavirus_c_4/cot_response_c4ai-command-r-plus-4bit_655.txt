SUMMARY:
The U.S. is witnessing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a single-day spike of over 47,000 new infections, and Dr. Anthony Fauci warning that this number could double. California, Texas, Arizona, and other states are facing record increases, with hospital beds in short supply. Dr. Fauci expressed deep concern over the situation, stating that it could worsen unless nationwide efforts are made to control the virus. The pandemic has also taken a toll on the economy, with millions losing their jobs and the country facing a sharp economic contraction. President Trump's handling of the crisis has been criticized, with rival Joe Biden stating that Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy. The situation has been deemed a result of "failed management." The upcoming July 4th celebrations have experts worried, as gatherings could lead to further spikes in cases. The EU has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for travel, reflecting the country's struggle to contain the virus. This rise in cases has renewed criticism of the government's response, highlighting the moral failures and concerns surrounding the pandemic's impact on public health and the economy.
