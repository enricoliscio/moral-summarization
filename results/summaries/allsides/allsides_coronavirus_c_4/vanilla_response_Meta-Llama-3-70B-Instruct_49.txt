SUMMARY:

The US has seen a record one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters of the pandemic, with record increases in cases. Hospital intensive care beds are in short supply in parts of Texas and Arizona. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries for non-essential travel. The surge in cases has led to renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy.
