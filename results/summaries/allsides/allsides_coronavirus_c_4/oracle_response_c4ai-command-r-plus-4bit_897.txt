SUMMARY: The United States is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a record-breaking spike of over 47,000 new infections reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase could reach 100,000 if nationwide efforts to tamp down the virus are not implemented. The surge in cases has been particularly severe in California, Texas, and Arizona, straining hospital resources. The economic fallout from the pandemic continues, with millions of job losses and a sharp contraction in the economy. The mismanagement of the pandemic by President Donald Trump has been criticized, with his rival Joe Biden stating that Trump "failed us" and that his actions have cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy. The rise in cases has also prompted some states to close bars and impose self-quarantine measures for travelers from other states. The upcoming Independence Day celebrations have raised concerns among healthcare workers about further spreading the virus. Fauci warned that the situation is not under control and that a nationwide push is needed to prevent further deterioration.
END OF SUMMARY.
