SUMMARY:
The US has seen a record surge in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday, sparking concerns from Dr. Anthony Fauci, who warned that the number could soon double. Fauci expressed his concern, stating that the country is "not in total control right now" and that the situation could get "very bad" if a nationwide effort is not made to combat the virus. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries, citing the country's failure to manage the pandemic. Democrat Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic, saying it has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage to the economy. As hospital beds fill up with COVID-19 patients, Dr. Marc Boom expressed his fear about Independence Day celebrations, saying it "scares me". The situation is dire, and urgent action is needed to prevent further catastrophe.
