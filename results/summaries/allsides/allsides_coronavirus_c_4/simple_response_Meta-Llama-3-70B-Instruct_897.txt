SUMMARY:

The US has reported its biggest one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, with over 47,000 new cases on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. Fauci expressed concern that the country is not in control of the pandemic, and that the surge in cases puts the entire country at risk. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries, citing the surge in cases. Critics, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, have blamed President Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic for the worsening situation. Biden unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic, calling for more testing and hiring 100,000 contract tracers. The situation is dire, with hospitals in Texas and Arizona struggling to cope with the surge in cases.
