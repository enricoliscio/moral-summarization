SUMMARY:
The US has seen a record-breaking spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 cases reported in a single day, sparking concerns from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert. Fauci warned that the daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide push is made to control the resurgent virus. He expressed his concerns, stating that the country is "not in total control right now" and that the situation could "get very bad." The fresh rise in cases and hospitalizations has dimmed hopes that the worst of the human and economic pain had passed, prompting renewed criticism of President Donald Trump's "historic mismanagement" of the pandemic. Trump's rival, Joe Biden, accused Trump of "failing" the country, saying that his mismanagement cost lives and inflicted more damage than necessary to the economy. END OF SUMMARY.
