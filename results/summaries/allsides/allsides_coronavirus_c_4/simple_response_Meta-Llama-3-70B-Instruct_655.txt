SUMMARY: The US has reported its largest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with over 47,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase could soon double to 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could get "very bad" and emphasized that the entire country is at risk, not just the emerging epicenters of California, Texas, and Arizona. The surge in cases has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy. As the situation worsens, hopes of a quick recovery are dwindling, and the moral imperative to take action to prevent further suffering and death is clear. END OF SUMMARY.
