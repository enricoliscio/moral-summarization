Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with a Reuters report about a significant increase in U.S. COVID-19 cases, over 47,000 in one day. That's the highest since the pandemic began. Dr. Fauci is warning that this number could double, which is concerning. States like California, Texas, and Arizona are becoming new epicenters with record cases. Fauci mentions the potential for 100,000 new cases daily unless measures are taken. He's worried about the entire country's risk, not just the affected areas. He also talks about the vaccine, saying it's not guaranteed but might be available by next year.

The article notes that cases doubled in June in at least 10 states, including Texas and Florida. Hospitals in Texas and Arizona are struggling with ICU beds. The death toll is over 126,000, and the economy is suffering. The EU is excluding the U.S. from its safe travel list, highlighting the failure of the Trump administration. Biden criticizes Trump's pandemic management, blaming him for the crisis and economic damage. Some states are closing bars again, and New York is requiring quarantines for travelers from certain states. Texas and Florida have record cases, with hospitals filling up. Dr. Boom is worried about Independence Day gatherings worsening the situation.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the surge in cases, Fauci's warning, new epicenters, vaccine comments, economic impact, EU travel ban, political criticism, state responses, and concerns about future gatherings.

I should structure it to cover the main facts without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the most critical information: the case spike, Fauci's concerns, states affected, impact on healthcare, economic and political implications, and the potential for worsening conditions.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the case numbers, mention Fauci's warning, the states affected, the impact on hospitals, the EU's action, Biden's criticism, state responses, and concerns about upcoming events.

I need to make sure each sentence is concise and covers the essential points without unnecessary details. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's accurate and flows well, covering all critical aspects of the article.
