SUMMARY: Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that new U.S. COVID-19 cases could soon double, reaching 100,000 per day if efforts are not made to control the spread of the virus. This warning comes as California, Texas, and Arizona report record increases in cases, with hospital beds in short supply in some areas. The surge in cases has been partly attributed to the reopening of bars and social gatherings, with experts fearing further spread during the upcoming Independence Day celebrations. 

The pandemic has not only caused a health crisis but also an economic one, with millions of Americans losing their jobs and the economy contracting sharply. As a result, the European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for non-essential travel. 

Dr. Fauci emphasized the need for a nationwide push to tackle the virus and expressed hope for a vaccine by early next year. However, he also acknowledged that there was no guarantee of a successful vaccine. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized President Trump for his handling of the pandemic, blaming his "historic mismanagement" for the severity of the crisis. 

The rise in cases and hospitalizations has sparked concerns that the worst may not be over yet, and has led to renewed calls for social distancing and other measures to prevent further damage to public health and the economy.
