SUMMARY: The US has reported its largest one-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with over 47,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the number could soon double unless a nationwide effort is made to tamp down the resurgent virus. He expressed concern that the situation could "get very bad" and put the entire country at risk. Fauci criticized the lack of control, stating that the country is not in "total control right now." The surge in cases has been attributed to states like California, Texas, and Arizona, where hospital intensive care beds are in short supply. The situation has led to renewed criticism of President Donald Trump, with his rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and inflicted unnecessary damage to the economy. Biden's updated plan to tackle the pandemic calls for more testing and the hiring of 100,000 contract tracers. END OF SUMMARY.
