SUMMARY:
The United States witnessed its biggest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases since the pandemic's onset, with over 47,000 new infections reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that this figure could double, expressing his *concern* over the situation. California, Texas, and Arizona are facing record increases, with hospital beds in short supply. The economic toll is immense, with millions unemployed and a contracting economy. The mismanagement of the pandemic by President Donald Trump has drawn criticism, with his rival Joe Biden blaming Trump for *failing* the country and causing unnecessary *damage*. The surge in cases has prompted states like California, Texas, and Florida to reclose bars and impose self-quarantine measures on travelers from other states. Experts fear the upcoming Independence Day celebrations could further worsen the situation. Dr. Fauci stressed the need for a nationwide push to control the virus, warning that daily cases could reach 100,000 without immediate action. The EU has excluded Americans from its "safe list" for travel, underscoring the severity of the crisis.
