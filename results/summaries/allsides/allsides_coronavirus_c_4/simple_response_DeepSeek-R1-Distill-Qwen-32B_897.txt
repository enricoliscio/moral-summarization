Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The user mentioned that I should focus on the moral aspects, so I should look for elements like blame, responsibility, or consequences related to the pandemic management.

First, the article talks about the surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with a record number of new cases. It mentions that California, Texas, and Arizona are new epicenters. Dr. Fauci is warning that the numbers could get worse unless there's a nationwide effort. This sets up a moral issue because it's about the government's handling of the pandemic.

The article also mentions that the EU excluded the U.S. from their safe list, which reflects poorly on the U.S. management. Then, it contrasts Trump's approach with Biden's criticism, pointing out that Trump's mismanagement led to more deaths and economic damage. This is a clear moral judgment against Trump's policies.

Additionally, the article notes that states like Texas and Florida are closing bars again, implying that reopening too soon contributed to the surge. This could be seen as a failure in public health measures. The mention of hospitals struggling and the fear of Independence Day gatherings adds to the sense of impending crisis, which ties back to the moral failure in managing the pandemic.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the surge in cases, Fauci's warning, the exclusion from the EU's safe list, Trump's criticism, and the consequences like hospital shortages and the potential for worse outcomes. I should present these in a concise way, under 200 words, highlighting the moral failures in pandemic management.

SUMMARY: U.S. COVID-19 cases surged to over 47,000 in a single day, the highest since the pandemic began, with California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned the daily increase could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort to control the virus is made. He emphasized the need for a coordinated response, as the virus threatens the entire country. Fauci also cautioned that a vaccine is not guaranteed, though early data is promising. States like Texas and Florida have seen cases more than double in June, with hospitals in some areas struggling to accommodate COVID-19 patients. The European Union has excluded the U.S. from its "safe list" for travel, highlighting the failure of U.S. pandemic management. President Trump has faced criticism for his handling of the crisis, with Democratic rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that cost lives and worsened the economic impact. States have begun closing bars again, while some regions are imposing quarantines on travelers from hotspots. Fauci expressed concern over upcoming Independence Day celebrations, warning that gatherings could exacerbate the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
