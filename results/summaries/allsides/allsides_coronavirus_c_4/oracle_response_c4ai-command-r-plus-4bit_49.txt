SUMMARY: The United States is facing a severe resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with a record-breaking spike of over 47,000 new infections in a single day. Dr. Anthony Fauci warns that this number could double to 100,000 unless urgent action is taken nationwide to tamp down the virus. States like California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are witnessing alarming increases in cases, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. The pandemic has already cost over 126,000 American lives and inflicted severe economic damage. The mismanagement of the crisis by President Trump is criticized, with rival Joe Biden stating that Trump "failed us." The surge in cases prompts states like California, Texas, and Florida to close bars and impose self-quarantine measures for travelers. Hospitals in Houston are filling up with COVID-19 patients, and experts worry about the potential impact of Independence Day celebrations. Dr. Fauci expresses concern about the situation, stating that it "scares" him. The EU has excluded Americans from its safe travel list, further highlighting the severity of the crisis.
