Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the underlying messages.

The article starts by highlighting a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with a record number of new cases. It mentions Dr. Anthony Fauci's concerns about the situation worsening and the potential for the daily cases to double. There's a focus on states like California, Texas, and Arizona becoming new epicenters. The economic impact is also discussed, including job losses and the shrinking economy.

Then, it talks about the EU excluding the U.S. from their safe list, which adds to the criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic. Biden is quoted criticizing Trump's management, suggesting that the situation could have been better if handled differently. The article also notes that certain states are closing bars again and that hospitals in Texas are struggling with bed shortages. There's a mention of concerns over upcoming Independence Day celebrations potentially worsening the situation.

Now, I need to summarize this while keeping the moral framing. The moral elements here are the criticism of Trump's leadership, the human cost in terms of lives and economy, and the potential consequences of not taking proper measures. I should make sure these points are included in the summary without adding my own opinions.

I should structure the summary to first state the increase in cases, Fauci's warning, the new epicenters, the economic impact, the EU's decision, Biden's criticism, the measures taken by some states, and the concerns about future events like Independence Day. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically.

I'll start with the main facts: record cases, Fauci's warning, states affected. Then move to the economic and political aspects, including Biden's criticism. Finally, mention the measures and concerns about celebrations. I need to make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without unnecessary details.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.
