Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the COVID-19 situation in the US. Let me read through the article first. 

So, the article starts by mentioning that new COVID cases in the US rose by over 47,000, which is the highest since the pandemic began. Dr. Fauci is warning that this number could double. California, Texas, and Arizona are the new epicenters. Fauci is concerned and says we're not in control. He mentions that without a nationwide effort, cases could reach 100,000 daily. He also talks about the possibility of a vaccine, but it's not certain. 

Then, the article notes that cases doubled in June in at least 10 states, including Texas and Florida. Hospitals in Texas and Arizona are struggling with ICU beds. The death toll is over 126,000, and the economy is contracting. 

The EU has excluded the US from their safe travel list, which adds to the criticism of Trump. Biden is criticizing Trump's handling of the pandemic, saying it cost lives and hurt the economy. States like California, Texas, and Florida are closing bars again. New York and others are requiring quarantines for travelers from certain states. South Carolina is another hotspot with record cases. Texas had a record day with 6,975 new cases, and hospitals are filling up. Dr. Boom is worried about Independence Day gatherings leading to more cases.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: new cases rising, epicenters, Fauci's warning, economic impact, EU travel ban, political criticism, state responses, and concerns about future cases.

Let me structure this: Start with the new case numbers and Fauci's warning. Mention the epicenters and the impact on hospitals. Then touch on the economic and political aspects, including the EU ban and Biden's criticism. Finally, note the state actions and concerns about future spikes.

I need to make sure it's concise and flows well. Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, I think that's a solid summary covering all main points without exceeding the limit.
