SUMMARY:

The US has seen a record one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, warned that the daily increase could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide effort is made to control the virus. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters of the pandemic, with record increases in cases. Fauci expressed concern that the situation could get "very bad" and emphasized the need for a nationwide push to combat the virus. The European Union has excluded Americans from its "safe list" of countries, citing the surge in cases. The development has sparked criticism of President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, with rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy.
