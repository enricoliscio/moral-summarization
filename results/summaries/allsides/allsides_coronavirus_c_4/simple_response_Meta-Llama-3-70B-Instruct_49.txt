SUMMARY: The US has seen a record spike in COVID-19 cases, with over 47,000 new cases reported in a single day, prompting warnings from Dr. Anthony Fauci that the number could soon double. California, Texas, and Arizona have emerged as new epicenters of the pandemic, with hospitals in these areas struggling to cope with the surge. Fauci expressed concern that the country is not in control of the virus and that a nationwide effort is needed to prevent further spread. The situation has led to renewed criticism of President Trump's handling of the pandemic, with Democratic rival Joe Biden accusing him of "historic mismanagement" that has cost lives and damaged the economy. The moral framing of this situation is one of accountability and responsibility, with leaders being called out for their failures to protect the public. END OF SUMMARY.
