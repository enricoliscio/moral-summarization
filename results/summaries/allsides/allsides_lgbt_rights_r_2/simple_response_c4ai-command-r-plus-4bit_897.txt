SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was disinvited from speaking at a venue in Liverpool due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible with our values" by the venue officials. Graham's event was part of a larger tour in the UK, and his stance on homosexuality as a sin has sparked backlash from LGBTQ+ groups and protesters. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ+ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and that his message of the Gospel is inclusive. While he acknowledges his belief that homosexuality is a sin, he emphasizes that all humans are sinners and that God's forgiveness and cleansing are available to everyone. Graham also defends free speech and religious liberty, inviting members of the LGBTQ+ community to attend his events.

END OF SUMMARY.
