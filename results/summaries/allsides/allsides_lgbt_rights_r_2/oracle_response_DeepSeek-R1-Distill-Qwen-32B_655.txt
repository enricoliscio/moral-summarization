Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author, such as "homophobic," "hate," "sin," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rev. Franklin Graham was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled because his views on marriage being between one man and one woman were seen as incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who called him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to share the Gospel, though he still believes homosexuality is a sin. He also emphasized his right to free speech and religious liberty, stating his message is inclusive and out of love, welcoming the LGBTQ community to attend.

Next, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the article: homophobic, hate, sin, guilty, need, penalty, death, separation, inclusive, speak, love, welcome. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include the cancellation of the event, the reasons given by the venue, the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality as a sin, his emphasis on inclusion and love, and the welcome to the LGBTQ community. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral terms are preserved.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the facts while highlighting the moral language used. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the event cancellation, the reasons, the protests, Graham's response, and his message.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each point is covered succinctly and the moral terms are included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure clarity and coherence.

SUMMARY:  
The Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist and son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at ACC Liverpool as part of his UK tour. However, the venue canceled his event, citing his biblical view of marriage as incompatible with their values. Critics, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, called him a "homophobic hate preacher" and protested his appearance. Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he came to share the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that all are sinners in need of forgiveness, with the penalty being spiritual deathâ€”separation from God. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, claiming his message was inclusive and born of love, not hate. He welcomed the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the UK.  

END OF SUMMARY.
