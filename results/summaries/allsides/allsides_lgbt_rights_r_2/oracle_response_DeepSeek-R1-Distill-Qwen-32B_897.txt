Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points and the moral terms used.

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled. The venue cited incompatibility with their values, specifically his biblical stance on marriage as one man and one woman. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, while still maintaining that homosexuality is a sin. He also emphasized free speech and religious liberty, stating he's inclusive and coming from love, welcoming everyone to attend.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible: homophobic, hate, sin, guilty, need, penalty, death, separation, inclusive, speak, love, welcome. I need to make sure these words are included without making the summary too long.

I should start by mentioning Graham's event cancellation and the reason. Then, note the protests and the labels used against him. Include his response, his stance on homosexuality as a sin, and his emphasis on love and inclusion. Make sure to include all the moral terms without making it sound forced.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me draft it, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral terms are present. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content and the moral framing provided by the author.

SUMMARY: Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled due to his biblical view of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, which organizers deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled him a "homophobic hate preacher" and opposed his appearance. Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he was not there to condemn them but to share the Gospel. He acknowledged homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that all are guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness, with the penalty being spiritual deathâ€”separation from God. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, insisting he was coming out of love, not hate, and that the Gospel is inclusive. He welcomed LGBTQ individuals to attend his events in the U.K. END OF SUMMARY.
