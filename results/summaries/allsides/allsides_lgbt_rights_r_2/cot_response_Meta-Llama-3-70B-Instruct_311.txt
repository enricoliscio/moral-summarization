SUMMARY:
The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was canceled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman was met with protests, with some labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that God's definition of sin applies to all humans, and that the Gospel is "inclusive." Graham defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, saying he is coming out of "love," not "hate." He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." The cancellation of Graham's event has sparked a debate on the limits of free speech and religious expression. END OF SUMMARY.
