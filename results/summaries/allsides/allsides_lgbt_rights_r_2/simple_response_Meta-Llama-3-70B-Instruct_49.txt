SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, which were deemed "incompatible" with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher". In response, Graham wrote an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. While he believes homosexuality is a sin, he emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness and that the Gospel is inclusive. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying he is coming out of love, not hate. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome".
