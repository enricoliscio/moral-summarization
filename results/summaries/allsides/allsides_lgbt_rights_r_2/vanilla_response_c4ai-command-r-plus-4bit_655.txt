SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a larger tour in the United Kingdom. However, the venue, ACC Liverpool, canceled his event due to his views on marriage, stating that they were "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he was coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. He admitted that he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming out of love. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events.
