SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his scheduled speaking event at ACC Liverpool canceled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and that he is not condemning anyone. While he admits to seeing homosexuality as a sin, he emphasizes that everyone, including himself, is a sinner in need of forgiveness. He defends the right to free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. Graham's message is one of inclusion, love, and welcome, despite his interpretation of homosexuality as a sin.
