SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was disinvited from speaking at a venue in Liverpool due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and is not condemning anyone. He affirmed his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, asserting that his message is not one of hate but of love and forgiveness. The letter highlighted his stance that while homosexuality is a sin, it is no different from other sins in God's eyes, and everyone is in need of forgiveness and spiritual cleansing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
