SUMMARY: Reverend Franklin Graham, an evangelist and son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a tour in the United Kingdom. However, the venue officials canceled his event, citing that his views on marriage as a union between one man and one woman are incompatible with their values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he is coming to present the Gospel out of love and not to condemn anyone. While he acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin, he emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty in his letter.
