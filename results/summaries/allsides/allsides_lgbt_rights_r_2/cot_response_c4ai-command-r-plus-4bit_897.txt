SUMMARY:
Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was slated to speak in Liverpool as part of a tour through the United Kingdom. However, officials at the ACC Liverpool venue recently announced that Graham's event would be canceled due to his views on marriage, which they deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized the venue for allowing Graham to share his message, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he comes out of love, not hate, and that he sees homosexuality as a sin according to his biblical interpretation. Graham defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, emphasizing that the Gospel is inclusive. While he acknowledges that homosexuality is considered a sin in his religious text, he also highlights that everyone, including himself, is a sinner in need of forgiveness. Graham invites members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the U.K., welcoming them with open arms. The cancellation of Graham's event in Liverpool highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with Graham's views on homosexuality being a central point of contention.
