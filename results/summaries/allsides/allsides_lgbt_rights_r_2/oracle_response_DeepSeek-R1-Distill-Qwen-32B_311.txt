Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham's event being canceled in Liverpool because his views on marriage are seen as incompatible with the venue's values. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Graham was scheduled to speak but the event was canceled. The reason given was his biblical stance on marriage, which the venue found incompatible. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, called him a homophobic hate preacher. There was a petition against him. 

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's not there to condemn but to share the Gospel. He admits seeing homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner. He also talks about the penalty of sin being spiritual death and separation from God. He defends free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he's coming out of love, welcoming everyone to his events.

The morally framed words to include are: homophobic, hate, sin, guilty, need, penalty, death, separation, inclusive, speak, love, welcome.

I'll structure the summary to cover the cancellation, the reasons, Graham's response, and his message. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate.

Let me start drafting: Rev. Franklin Graham's UK tour event in Liverpool was canceled because his views on marriage as one man and one woman were incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, called him homophobic and a hate preacher, leading to a petition. Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to share the Gospel, acknowledging homosexuality as a sin but emphasizing everyone's guilt and need for forgiveness. He mentioned the penalty of sin as spiritual death and separation from God, while defending free speech and religious liberty. He stated the Gospel is inclusive, coming out of love, and welcomed the LGBTQ community to his events.

I think that covers all the points and includes the moral terms. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.
