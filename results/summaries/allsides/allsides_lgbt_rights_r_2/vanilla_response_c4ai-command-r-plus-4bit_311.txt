SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a tour in the United Kingdom. However, the venue, ACC Liverpool, canceled his event due to his views on marriage, stating that they were incompatible with their values. Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman had sparked protests from groups such as the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who referred to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he is coming to present the Gospel and not to condemn anyone. While he admitted that he considers homosexuality a sin, he emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming out of love. He also defended free speech and religious liberty and invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the U.K.

END OF SUMMARY.
