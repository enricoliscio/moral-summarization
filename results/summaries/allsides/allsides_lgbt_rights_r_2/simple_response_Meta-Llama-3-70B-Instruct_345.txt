SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, which were deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He welcomed the LGBTQ community to attend his events.
