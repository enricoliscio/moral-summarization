Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled because his views on marriage and homosexuality were seen as incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, especially from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, though he still believes homosexuality is a sin. He also defended free speech and religious liberty.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. I'll go through the article again and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "evangelist," "preacher," "values," "protesters," "rebuking," "homophobic," "hate," "sin," "condemn," "Gospel," "inclusive," "love," "welcome," "equality," "rights," "discrimination," "freedom," "liberty," "controversy," "tolerance," "respect." Each of these words carries a moral charge in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by stating that Rev. Franklin Graham's event was canceled because his views on marriage were incompatible with the venue's values. Then mention the protests, especially from the LGBT Network calling him homophobic. Graham responded, saying he's there to present the Gospel, not to condemn, though he still sees homosexuality as a sin. He defended free speech and religious liberty, emphasizing love and inclusion, and welcomed the LGBTQ community to his events. The cancellation sparked debate about equality, rights, and religious freedom.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral terms highlighted. I'll structure it to first state the cancellation, then the reasons, Graham's response, and the implications of the decision. Keeping it under 200 words while preserving the moral framing is crucial.
