SUMMARY: Reverend Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a tour in the United Kingdom. However, the venue, ACC Liverpool, canceled his event due to his views on marriage, stating that they were "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he was coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone, and that everyone is welcome at his events. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating that the Gospel is inclusive. Graham admitted that he considers homosexuality a sin but emphasized that God sees everyone as a sinner in need of forgiveness.
