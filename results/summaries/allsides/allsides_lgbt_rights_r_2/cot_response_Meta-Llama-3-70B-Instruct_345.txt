SUMMARY:
The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was cancelled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a "sin," but emphasized that all humans are "guilty" of sin and in need of "forgiveness" and "cleansing." Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is "inclusive" and he is coming out of "love," not "hate." He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." END OF SUMMARY.
