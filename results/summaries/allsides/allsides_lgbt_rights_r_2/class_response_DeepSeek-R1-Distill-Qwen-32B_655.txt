Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rev. Franklin Graham's event in Liverpool was canceled because his views on marriage were deemed incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, especially from the LGBTQ community, who called him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, still believing homosexuality is a sin. He also defended free speech and religious liberty.

I need to include words like "stop," "incompatible," "rebuking," "platforming," "penned," "sin," "forgiveness," "death," "liberty," "inclusive." 

I'll structure the summary to mention the cancellation, the reason, the protests, Graham's response, his views on sin and forgiveness, and his defense of free speech. I'll make sure to use the specified words naturally within the summary.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely and the moral terms are included. I'll keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist, was scheduled to speak at ACC Liverpool as part of his UK tour, but the event was canceled due to his views on marriage being deemed "incompatible" with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for allowing Graham, calling him "a homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded by penning an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he was not there to condemn them but to present the Gospel. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized God's forgiveness and love for all. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, claiming the Gospel is "inclusive" and welcoming LGBTQ individuals to his events. The cancellation reflects tensions over his stance on sin and inclusion. END OF SUMMARY.
