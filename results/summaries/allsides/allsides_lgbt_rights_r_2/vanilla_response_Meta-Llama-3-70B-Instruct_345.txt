SUMMARY:

The Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, has had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his views on marriage and homosexuality. The venue cited that Graham's views were "incompatible with our values." Graham's event was part of a larger UK tour, and his appearance was met with protests from groups like the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who called him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he views homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that the Bible teaches that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
