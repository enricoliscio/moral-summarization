SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his speaking engagement at a Liverpool venue canceled due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible" with the values of the venue. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for allowing Graham to share his beliefs, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, asserting that he comes from a place of love and is not speaking against anybody. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that God sees everyone as sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel message. He invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the U.K., welcoming them despite their differing views. The cancellation of Graham's stop in Liverpool highlights the tension between religious beliefs and LGBTQ rights, with Graham's interpretation of marriage being incompatible with the values of the venue and some members of the community. END OF SUMMARY.
