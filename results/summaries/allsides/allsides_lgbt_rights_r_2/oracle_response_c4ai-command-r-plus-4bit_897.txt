SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had a scheduled speaking event at a venue in Liverpool canceled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed incompatible with the values of the venue. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, referred to Graham as a "homophobic hate preacher" due to his biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the U.K. to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. While admitting that he does view homosexuality as a sin, he emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming out of love, not hate. He invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events, welcoming them despite their differences. Graham also defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, stating that he is speaking for everybody, not against anybody. The cancellation of Graham's event highlights the ongoing tension between religious beliefs and LGBTQ rights, with some seeing his views as incompatible with modern values of inclusion and tolerance.
END OF SUMMARY.
