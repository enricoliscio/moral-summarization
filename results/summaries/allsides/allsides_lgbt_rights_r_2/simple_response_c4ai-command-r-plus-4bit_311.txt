SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was disinvited from speaking at a venue in Liverpool due to his biblical views on marriage. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and that he is not condemning anyone. He affirmed his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that all are welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, asserting that his message is not one of hate but of love and inclusion.
