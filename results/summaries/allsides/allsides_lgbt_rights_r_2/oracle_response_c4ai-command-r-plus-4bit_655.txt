SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his speaking engagement at a venue in Liverpool canceled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed incompatible with the values of the venue. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. He admitted that he believes homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming from a place of love. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. He asserted that everyone, himself included, is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness.
