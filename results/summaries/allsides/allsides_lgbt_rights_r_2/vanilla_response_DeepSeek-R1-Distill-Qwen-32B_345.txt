Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rev. Franklin Graham. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Rev. Franklin Graham was supposed to speak in Liverpool as part of his UK tour. The venue, ACC Liverpool, canceled his event because his views on marriage are incompatible with their values. Specifically, he believes marriage is between one man and one woman, which the venue doesn't agree with. There were protests against him, especially from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher.

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's not there to condemn them but to share the Gospel. He admitted he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating he's coming out of love, not hate, and invites the LGBTQ community to his events.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the cancellation, the reason, the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality, his invitation, and his defense of free speech.

Let me make sure to include all these points concisely. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.
