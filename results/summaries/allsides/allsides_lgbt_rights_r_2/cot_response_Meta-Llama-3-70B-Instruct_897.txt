SUMMARY:
The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is "inclusive" and comes from a place of "love." He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." Graham's event was part of a larger UK tour, which will continue despite the cancellation.
