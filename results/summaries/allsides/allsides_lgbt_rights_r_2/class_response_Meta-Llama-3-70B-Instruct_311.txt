SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool has been stopped due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, have been rebuking the venue for allowing Graham to share the Gospel, labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended the right to free speech and religious liberty, asserting that the Gospel is "inclusive" and he is coming out of love, not hate. He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
