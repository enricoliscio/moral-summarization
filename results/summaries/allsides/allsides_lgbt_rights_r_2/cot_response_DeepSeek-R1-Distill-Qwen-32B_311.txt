Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "evangelist," "values," "incompatible," "protesters," "rebuking," "homophobic," "hate," "condemn," "sin," "forgiveness," "cleansing," "penalty," "spiritual death," "separation," "free speech," "religious liberty," "hate," "love," and "welcome" stand out as they relate to moral or ethical issues.

Moving on to the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or fewer, ensuring I include these moral terms. The key points are Rev. Franklin Graham's event cancellation due to his views on marriage, the venue's incompatibility with their values, protests, Graham's response emphasizing love and inclusion while maintaining his stance on homosexuality as a sin, and his defense of free speech and religious liberty.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the cancellation and the reason, then the protests and opposition, followed by Graham's response and his moral arguments. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original framing.

I need to be careful to present both sides: the venue's stance and Graham's perspective, including his appeal to love and inclusion despite his controversial views. Keeping it concise while covering all necessary points is crucial.

Finally, I'll review to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit, making adjustments as needed to fit everything in without losing the moral nuances.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist and son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled due to his biblical views on marriage as a union between one man and one woman, which were deemed "incompatible" with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham as a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded by stating he would not condemn the LGBTQ community but would present the Gospel, acknowledging homosexuality as a sin while emphasizing God's love and forgiveness. He defended free speech and religious liberty, claiming his message was inclusive and rooted in love, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The cancellation reflects a clash between Graham's moral stance and the venue's values, highlighting tensions over religious expression and inclusivity.
