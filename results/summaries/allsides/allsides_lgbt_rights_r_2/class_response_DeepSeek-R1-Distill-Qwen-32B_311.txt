Okay, so the user has provided a news article about Rev. Franklin Graham and his event being canceled in Liverpool. They want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The user also specified certain morally framed words that must be included.

First, I need to read through the article carefully. The main points are that Graham's event was canceled because his views on marriage are incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, especially from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who called him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded with an open letter, stating he's not there to condemn but to share the Gospel, while still believing homosexuality is a sin. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, emphasizing the inclusive nature of the Gospel.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: stop, incompatible, rebuking, platforming, penned, sin, forgiveness, death, liberty, inclusive. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating that Graham's event was canceled because his views were incompatible. Then mention the protests, using'rebuking' and 'platforming.' Next, explain his response, including 'penned,''sin,' and his stance on forgiveness and death. Finally, highlight his defense of liberty and the inclusive Gospel, using 'inclusive' twice as in the original.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while including all the required words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool as part of his UK tour, but the event was canceled due to his views on marriage being "incompatible" with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized the venue for "platforming" Graham, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded by penning an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he was not there to condemn them but to share the Gospel. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a "sin" but emphasized God's forgiveness and love for all. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, asserting the Gospel is "inclusive" and welcoming everyone, including the LGBTQ community, to his events.  

END OF SUMMARY.
