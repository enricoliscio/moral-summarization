SUMMARY:
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist and son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool as part of his UK tour. However, his event was canceled by the venue, ACC Liverpool, due to his views on marriage being deemed incompatible with their values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and not hate. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating that he is not condemning anyone but rather presenting the Gospel message of forgiveness and cleansing. The preacher's stance on homosexuality as a sin and his insistence on the inclusivity of the Gospel form a moral framework that shapes his response to the controversy surrounding his canceled event.
