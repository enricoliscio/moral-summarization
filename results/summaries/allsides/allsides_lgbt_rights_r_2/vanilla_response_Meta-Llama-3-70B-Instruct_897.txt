SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, has had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values" by the venue. Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman has sparked controversy, with groups like the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the UK, stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he believes homosexuality is a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is inclusive and comes from a place of love. He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the UK.
