Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main event is Rev. Franklin Graham's speaking event being canceled at ACC Liverpool because his views on marriage are seen as incompatible with the venue's values. There's opposition from groups like the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who call him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responds by saying he's coming to share the Gospel, not to condemn, and he believes homosexuality is a sin but emphasizes God's love and inclusion.

For the first part, I need to identify all the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "evangelist," "biblical," "marriage," "union," "incompatible," "values," "protesters," "rebuking," "homophobic," "hate," "condemn," "Gospel," "sin," "forgiveness," "cleansing," "penalty," "spiritual death," "separation," "free speech," "religious liberty," "inclusive," "love," and "absolutely welcome" all seem to carry moral weight.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these moral terms. The summary should be under 200 words and highlight the conflict between Graham's beliefs and the venue's values, the opposition from LGBTQ groups, Graham's response emphasizing love and inclusion despite his stance on homosexuality, and his defense of free speech.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the cancellation, then the reason, the opposition, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality, and his emphasis on love and inclusion. I'll make sure to include the key moral words to preserve the framing.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I think this approach covers all necessary points while keeping it concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist and son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled due to his biblical view of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, which was deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized him as a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he came to share the Gospel, not to condemn. He admitted he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized God's love and inclusion, defending free speech and religious liberty. He assured the LGBTQ community they are "absolutely welcome" to attend his events.
