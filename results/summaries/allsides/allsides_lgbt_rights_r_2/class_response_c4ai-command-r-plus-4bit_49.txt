SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his planned speaking event at a venue in Liverpool, UK, canceled due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible" with the values of the venue's officials. Protesters had been rebuking the venue for allowing Graham to share his beliefs, with one group calling him "a homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and that he is not condemning anyone. While acknowledging his belief that homosexuality is a sin, he emphasized that everyone is a sinner in need of forgiveness and that the Gospel is inclusive. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting members of the LGBTQ community to attend his other events in the UK. The cancellation of Graham's stop in Liverpool highlights the ongoing tension between religious beliefs and LGBTQ rights, with some seeing his views as incompatible with modern values.
END OF SUMMARY.
