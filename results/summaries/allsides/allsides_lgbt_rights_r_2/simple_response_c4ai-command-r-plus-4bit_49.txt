SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was disinvited from speaking at a venue in Liverpool due to his biblical views on marriage. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and is not condemning anyone. While acknowledging his belief that homosexuality is a sin, he emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, asserting that he is speaking for everyone, not against anyone. The decision to cancel his appearance highlights ongoing tensions between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with Graham's views being deemed incompatible with modern values.
