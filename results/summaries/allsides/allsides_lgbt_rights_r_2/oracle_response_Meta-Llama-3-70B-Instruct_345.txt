SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he's coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that, according to the Bible, homosexuality is a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The penalty of sin is spiritual death, separation from God for eternity. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he's coming out of love, not hate. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." Graham's message emphasizes the need for forgiveness and cleansing, while promoting an inclusive and loving approach.
