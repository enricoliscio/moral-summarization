SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had a stop on his U.K. tour cancelled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed "incompatible" with the values of the venue, ACC Liverpool. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for platforming Graham, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the U.K. to present the Gospel out of love, not hate. He admitted that he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating that he is not speaking against anybody but for everybody. The decision to cancel Graham's stop in Liverpool highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with Graham's views on homosexuality being seen as incompatible with modern values of inclusivity and acceptance.
