Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Rev. Franklin Graham's event being canceled in Liverpool. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are that Graham was supposed to speak at ACC Liverpool, but the venue canceled his event because his views on marriage are incompatible with their values. He supports traditional marriage between one man and one woman, which they don't agree with. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher.

Graham responded by writing an open letter. He said he's coming to share the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also defends free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he's coming out of love, not hate. He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

I should include all these key points: the cancellation, the reason, the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality, his emphasis on love and inclusion, and his invitation. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to mention the venue, the reason for cancellation, the protests, and his open letter's main points.

I need to structure it clearly, starting with the event cancellation, then the reason, the protests, Graham's response, his views, and his invitation. Make sure it's all in a logical flow without getting too detailed.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, I think that's all the important information covered. Time to put it together concisely.
