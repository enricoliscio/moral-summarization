SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool has been stopped due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, have been rebuking the venue for allowing Graham to share the Gospel, labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that God defines all humans as sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is "inclusive" and comes from a place of love, not hate. He welcomed the LGBTQ community to attend his events, stating they are "absolutely welcome." The cancellation of Graham's event raises questions about the limits of free speech and the role of religious liberty in modern society.
