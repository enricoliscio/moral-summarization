SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values." Graham believes in the biblical definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, which has been criticized as homophobic. Despite this, Graham replied to the decision with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is not coming to condemn them, but to present the Gospel. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying that the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He even invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
