SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, had his event at ACC Liverpool cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, which were deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin, but emphasized that God considers all humans sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is inclusive and comes from a place of love. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, welcoming them with open arms. The cancellation raises questions about the limits of free speech and religious expression in the face of differing values.
