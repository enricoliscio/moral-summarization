SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool has been canceled due to his views on marriage being "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher" for his biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is not coming to condemn them, but to present the Gospel. He acknowledged that he believes homosexuality is a "sin," but emphasized that God sees all humans as "sinners" in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The "penalty of sin" is "spiritual death" and "separation from God for eternity." Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is "inclusive" and he is coming out of "love" rather than "hate." He extended a welcome to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
