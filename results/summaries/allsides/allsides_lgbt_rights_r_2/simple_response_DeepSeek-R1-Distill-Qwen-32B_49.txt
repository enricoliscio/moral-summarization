Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rev. Franklin Graham and his canceled event in Liverpool. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, was supposed to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled. The reason given by the venue was that his views on marriage being between one man and one woman were incompatible with their values. There were protests, especially from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. A petition was started, and the venue decided to cancel the event.

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's not there to condemn them but to present the Gospel. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating he's coming out of love, not hate, and invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

I need to capture the moral conflict here: Graham's religious beliefs versus the venue's values on inclusivity. The protesters are against his views, while Graham tries to frame his message as inclusive and loving despite his stance on homosexuality.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects both sides of the moral debate. I'll structure it by first stating the cancellation, then the reasons from both sides, and conclude with Graham's response.

Let me make sure I include the key points: cancellation due to incompatible views, protests, Graham's open letter, his stance on homosexuality as a sin, his emphasis on love and inclusion, and the venue's values. I need to balance both perspectives without taking sides, just presenting the moral framing as in the article.

I think that's all. Time to put it together in a clear, concise summary.

Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he aimed to present the Gospel, not condemn them. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that everyone, including himself, is a sinner in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, asserting his message was one of love and inclusion, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The cancellation highlights a clash between religious beliefs and progressive values. END OF SUMMARY.
