Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled. The venue, ACC Liverpool, canceled it because his views on marriage are incompatible with their values. Specifically, he believes marriage is between one man and one woman, which they see as incompatible.

There were protests against him, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, which called him a homophobic hate preacher. A petition was started asking elected representatives to support canceling his event.

Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's not there to condemn them but to present the Gospel. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating he's coming out of love, not hate, and welcomes LGBTQ people to his events.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let's go through the article again.

- "evangelist" (neutral, not moral)
- "slated" (neutral)
- "venue" (neutral)
- "Liverpool" (neutral)
- "scrubbed" (neutral)
- "incompatible with our values" (moral: incompatible, values)
- "biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman" (moral: biblical, interpretation, marriage, union, man, woman)
- "homophobic hate preacher" (moral: homophobic, hate)
- "platforming" (neutral)
- "Gospel" (neutral)
- "condemn" (moral)
- "present the Gospel" (neutral)
- "admit" (neutral)
- "homosexuality as a sin" (moral: sin)
- "God defines homosexuality as sin" (moral: defines, sin)
- "all sinners" (moral: sinners)
- "need of forgiveness and cleansing" (moral: forgiveness, cleansing)
- "penalty of sin is spiritual death" (moral: penalty, spiritual death)
- "separation from God" (moral)
- "defended the right to free speech and religious liberty" (moral: defended, right, free speech, religious liberty)
- "coming out of hate" (moral: hate)
- "coming out of love" (moral: love)
- "absolutely welcome" (moral: welcome)

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants me to list single words that are morally framed. So I should look for words that carry a moral judgment or connotation.

Looking again:

- "incompatible" (morally incompatible)
- "values" (moral values)
- "biblical" (religiously moral)
- "union" (moral in the context of marriage)
- "homophobic" (negative moral judgment)
- "hate" (negative)
- "condemn" (negative)
- "sin" (negative moral)
- "forgiveness" (positive moral)
- "cleansing" (positive moral)
- "penalty" (negative)
- "spiritual death" (negative)
- "separation from God" (negative)
- "defended" (positive)
- "right" (positive moral)
- "free speech" (positive moral)
- "religious liberty" (positive moral)
- "hate" (negative)
- "love" (positive)
- "welcome" (positive)

So the morally framed words are: incompatible, values, biblical, union, homophobic, hate, condemn, sin, forgiveness, cleansing, penalty, spiritual death, separation, defended, right, free speech, religious liberty, love, welcome.

Now, I need to write a summary using as many of these as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main points: Graham's event was canceled because his views on marriage (biblical, union, man and woman) were incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the LGBT Network, called him homophobic and a hate preacher. He responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, admitting homosexuality is a sin but emphasizing everyone is a sinner. He defended free speech and religious liberty, stating he's coming out of love, not hate, and welcomes LGBTQ attendees.

Putting it all together, making sure to include the moral terms.
