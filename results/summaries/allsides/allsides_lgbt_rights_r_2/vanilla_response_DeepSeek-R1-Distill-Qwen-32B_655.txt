Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rev. Franklin Graham and his event in Liverpool. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by saying that Franklin Graham, who's the son of Billy Graham, was supposed to speak in Liverpool this summer. But the event got canceled. The reason given by the venue, ACC Liverpool, is that his views on marriage, specifically that it's between one man and one woman, are incompatible with their values. They decided to cancel the event, which was originally planned for June 2020.

There were protests against him speaking there. A group called Liverpool Labour LGBT Network called him a homophobic hate preacher and started a petition against it. They wanted local council support to stop him from speaking.

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's coming to share the Gospel, not to condemn them. He admitted that he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also talked about free speech and religious liberty, stating that the Gospel is inclusive and he's coming out of love, not hate. He welcomed the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

So, the main points are:
1. Graham's event was canceled in Liverpool.
2. The venue cited incompatible views on marriage.
3. Protests and a petition by an LGBTQ group.
4. Graham's response: he's there to share the Gospel, not condemn; homosexuality is a sin but everyone is a sinner; he supports free speech and inclusion.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include all the key points: who, what, why, how, and his response. Also, mention the venue's reason, the protests, and his stance on homosexuality and free speech.

Let me structure it step by step:
- Introduction: Event canceled, venue's reason.
- Protest details: group's name, petition.
- Graham's response: letter content, stance on homosexuality, free speech, invitation to attend.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.
