SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of late preacher Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at ACC Liverpool as part of his UK tour. However, the venue canceled the event due to Graham's views on marriage, which are "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he believes homosexuality is a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
