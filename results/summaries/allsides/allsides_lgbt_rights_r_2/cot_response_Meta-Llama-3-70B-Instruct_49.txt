SUMMARY:
The Rev. Franklin Graham's event in Liverpool was canceled by ACC Liverpool due to his views on marriage being "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman was deemed "homophobic" and "hate" by protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network. In response, Graham wrote an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a "sin," but emphasized that God's message is one of "love" and "forgiveness." Graham defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, saying that the Gospel is "inclusive" and welcomes everyone, including the LGBTQ community. Despite the cancellation, Graham's UK tour will continue. END OF SUMMARY.
