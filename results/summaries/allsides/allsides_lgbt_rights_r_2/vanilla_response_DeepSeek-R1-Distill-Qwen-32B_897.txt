Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user has specified that the summary should be after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, whose speaking event in Liverpool was canceled. The reason given was his views on marriage being incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who called him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by writing an open letter, stating he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, though he still believes homosexuality is a sin. He also defended free speech and religious liberty.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning the cancellation of the event, the reason, the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality, and his defense of free speech. I should keep each sentence clear and to the point, ensuring it's under 200 words.

I'll structure it as: Event canceled, reason, protests, Graham's response, his beliefs, and his defense. Make sure to include key details without getting too wordy. Also, use proper names and dates where necessary, like June 2020.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure each part is covered succinctly. Maybe start with the cancellation, then the reason, then the protests, followed by Graham's letter and his points. That should cover all essential information without exceeding the word limit.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content. Double-check for any important details I might have missed, like Graham's age or the venue name, but since it's a summary, maybe not all specifics are necessary unless they add significant context.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at ACC Liverpool in June 2020 as part of his UK tour. The event was canceled due to Graham's biblical view of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, which the venue deemed incompatible with its values. Protests against Graham's appearance were led by groups like the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, which called him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he came to share the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and meant for everyone. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The cancellation and response highlight tensions over religious beliefs and inclusivity.  
END OF SUMMARY.
