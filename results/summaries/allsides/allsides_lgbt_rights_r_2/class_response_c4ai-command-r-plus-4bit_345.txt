SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had a speaking engagement cancelled in Liverpool due to his views on homosexuality being deemed "incompatible" with the values of the venue, ACC Liverpool. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for allowing Graham to share his message, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, asserting that he comes from a place of love and that he is not condemning anyone. He admits that he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and in need of forgiveness. Graham defends his right to free speech and religious liberty, stating that the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming to speak for everyone. He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the U.K. and hear his message of love and forgiveness.
