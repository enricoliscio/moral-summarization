SUMMARY:

The Rev. Franklin Graham's event in Liverpool has been cancelled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman has been criticized by groups like the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who label him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledges that God defines homosexuality as a "sin," but emphasizes that all humans are "guilty of sin" and in need of forgiveness. Graham defends his right to free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is "inclusive" and comes from a place of "love." He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." Graham's stance highlights the tension between religious beliefs and modern values.
