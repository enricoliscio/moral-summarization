SUMMARY:
The evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was slated to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a tour through the United Kingdom. However, officials at the ACC Liverpool venue canceled his event, citing that Graham's views on marriage as a union between one man and one woman are "incompatible with our values." This decision comes amid protests from groups such as the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, who labeled Graham as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the U.K., stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He admitted that he considers homosexuality a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming out of love. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The preacher's stance on homosexuality as a sin and his defense of inclusion and love highlight a complex moral dilemma.
