Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Rev. Franklin Graham was supposed to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled. The venue said his views on marriage being between one man and one woman are incompatible with their values. There were protests, especially from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. They even started a petition.

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's not there to condemn them but to present the Gospel. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, saying he's coming out of love, not hate, and invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The venue's decision was based on conflicting values, which is a moral stance. The protesters' actions and Graham's response both involve moral arguments. I should highlight the tension between free speech and opposing views on LGBTQ issues.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the cancellation, the reason given by the venue, mention the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality as a sin, his invitation, and his defense of free speech. I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all these elements without being too detailed.

Let me structure it step by step. First, the event cancellation and reason. Then, the protests and petition. Next, Graham's response in his letter, his stance on homosexuality, and his invitation. Finally, his defense of free speech and the moral conflict. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the facts as presented, making sure the moral perspectives are clear. Keeping it within the word limit is crucial, so I'll be concise with each point.
