Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled. The venue, ACC Liverpool, decided it was incompatible with their values because of Graham's views on marriage. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, were rebuking the venue for allowing him. They called him a homophobic hate preacher. 

Graham responded by penning an open letter, stating he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also talks about spiritual death and the importance of religious liberty and inclusivity, saying the Gospel is inclusive and everyone is welcome.

I need to make sure to include the moral words: stop, incompatible, rebuking, platforming, penned, sin, forgiveness, death, liberty, inclusive. 

I'll start by mentioning the cancellation, the reason it was incompatible, the protesters rebuking, and the platforming issue. Then, Graham's response, his letter, his view on sin, forgiveness, death, and his stance on liberty and inclusivity. 

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without losing the summary's flow.
