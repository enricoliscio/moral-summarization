SUMMARY:
Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was slated to speak at a venue in Liverpool as part of a tour through the United Kingdom. However, officials at the ACC Liverpool venue canceled his event, citing Graham's views on marriage as "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he was coming to the U.K. to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. He admitted that he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that he was coming "out of love" and that the Gospel is inclusive. Graham also defended his right to free speech and religious liberty. He invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events, welcoming them "absolutely." The decision to cancel Graham's stop in Liverpool highlights the ongoing tension between religious beliefs and LGBTQ rights, with some seeing Graham's views as hateful and incompatible with modern values.
