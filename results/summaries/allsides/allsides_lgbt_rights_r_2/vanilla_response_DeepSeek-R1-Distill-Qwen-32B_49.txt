Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled. The venue said his views on marriage being between one man and one woman don't align with their values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, called him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by saying he's not there to condemn but to present the Gospel, though he still believes homosexuality is a sin. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the cancellation, the reason given by the venue, the protests, Graham's response, his stance on homosexuality, his defense of free speech, and his invitation to the LGBTQ community. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is included without extra details. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important aspects are covered succinctly.
