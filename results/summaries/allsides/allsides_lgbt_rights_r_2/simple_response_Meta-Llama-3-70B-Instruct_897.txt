SUMMARY:

The Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak in Liverpool as part of a UK tour, but the event was canceled by the venue, ACC Liverpool, due to his views on marriage being "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman was deemed homophobic by protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is not coming to condemn them, but to present the Gospel, which is inclusive and based on love, not hate. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The cancellation raises concerns about the erosion of religious freedom and the silencing of diverse viewpoints.
