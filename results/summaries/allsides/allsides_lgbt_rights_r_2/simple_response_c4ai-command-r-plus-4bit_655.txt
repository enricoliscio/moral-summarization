SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his speaking event cancelled by ACC Liverpool due to his views on homosexuality being deemed incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters and LGBTQ+ groups had criticized the venue for allowing Graham to share his biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ+ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and that he is not condemning them but presenting the Gospel. While admitting that he does view homosexuality as a sin, he emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating that he is not speaking against anyone but for everyone. The cancellation of Graham's event highlights the ongoing debate between religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights, with some seeing it as a form of censorship and others as a necessary step towards inclusivity and tolerance.
