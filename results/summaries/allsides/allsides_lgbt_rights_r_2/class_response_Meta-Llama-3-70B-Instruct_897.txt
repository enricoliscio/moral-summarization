SUMMARY:

The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was stopped due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for allowing Graham to share the Gospel, labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he sees homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that God views all humans as sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended the right to free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is "inclusive" and he is coming out of love, not hate. He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." The cancellation of Graham's event raises questions about the limits of free speech and religious liberty in the face of conflicting values.
