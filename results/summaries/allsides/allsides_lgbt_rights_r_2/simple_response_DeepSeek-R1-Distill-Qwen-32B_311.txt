Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled. The venue, ACC Liverpool, decided to cancel because his views on marriage being between one man and one woman are incompatible with their values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. 

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community. He said he's coming to share the Gospel, not to condemn them. He admitted he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasized that everyone is a sinner and in need of God's forgiveness. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, stating his intention is inclusive, not to hate.

So, the moral framing here involves religious beliefs clashing with progressive values, especially regarding LGBTQ rights. The venue's decision to cancel reflects a conflict between supporting a religious figure whose views are seen as discriminatory and their own inclusive values. Graham's response tries to balance his religious stance with a message of love and inclusion, but it's still controversial.

I need to capture this conflict in the summary. It should mention the cancellation, the reason related to his views on marriage, the protests, his response, and the underlying moral debate about religious freedom versus inclusivity.

Let me structure this concisely. Start with the cancellation, reason, protests, Graham's letter, his stance on homosexuality as a sin, his emphasis on love and inclusion, and the broader moral debate.

I should keep it under 200 words, so each point needs to be brief. Make sure to include that he sees homosexuality as a sin but also emphasizes love and inclusion. Also, note the venue's incompatibility with their values and the protests from the LGBTQ network.

Putting it all together, ensuring the moral aspects are clear: the clash between religious belief and progressive values, the right to free speech vs. inclusivity, and Graham's attempt to reconcile his message with love despite his stance on homosexuality.
