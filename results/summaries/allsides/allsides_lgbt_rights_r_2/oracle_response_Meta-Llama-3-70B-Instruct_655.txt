SUMMARY:

The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was cancelled due to his "incompatible" views on marriage, which are rooted in his biblical interpretation that it is a union between one man and one woman. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher". In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he believes homosexuality is a "sin", but emphasized that God sees all humans as "sinners" in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended the right to free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is "inclusive" and comes from a place of "love", not "hate". He extended a welcome to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome".
