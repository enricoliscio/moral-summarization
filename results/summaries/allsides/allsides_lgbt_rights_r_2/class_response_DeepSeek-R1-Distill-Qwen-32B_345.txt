Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, who was supposed to speak in Liverpool but had his event canceled. The venue said his views on marriage being between one man and one woman are incompatible with their values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, which called him a homophobic hate preacher. 

Graham responded by writing an open letter to the LGBTQ community, saying he's coming to share the Gospel, not to condemn them. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also defends free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he's coming out of love, not hate. He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: stop, incompatible, rebuking, a, platforming, penned, goes, sin, forgiveness, death, liberty, inclusive. I should include as many as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with the event being canceled because his views are incompatible. Mention the protests, the group rebuking the venue for platforming him. Then, Graham's response in his open letter, addressing sin and forgiveness, his defense of liberty, and the inclusive nature of the Gospel.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure each key point is covered with the moral terms. 

Let me draft the summary: Rev. Franklin Graham's speaking event in Liverpool was canceled because his views on marriage are incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for platforming him, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by penning an open letter, stating he's sharing the Gospel, not condemning, and acknowledges homosexuality as a sin. He emphasizes forgiveness and love, defending free speech and religious liberty, calling the Gospel inclusive. He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

That should cover all the key points with the moral framing. I think that's concise and includes the required words.
