SUMMARY:

Reverend Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool has been cancelled due to his views on marriage, which are deemed "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman has sparked controversy, with some labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the UK, stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. While he admits to seeing homosexuality as a sin, he emphasizes that God considers all humans sinners and in need of forgiveness. Graham defends free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He invites the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the UK, stating they are "absolutely welcome."
