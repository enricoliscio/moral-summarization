SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his speaking engagement at ACC Liverpool canceled due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed incompatible with the venue's values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, had criticized Graham's appearance, referring to him as a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community in the UK, stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone, and that his message is one of love and inclusion. While acknowledging that he does view homosexuality as a sin, Graham emphasized that the Gospel is for everyone and that all are sinners in need of forgiveness. He also defended free speech and religious liberty. Graham invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events in the UK, emphasizing that they are welcome.
