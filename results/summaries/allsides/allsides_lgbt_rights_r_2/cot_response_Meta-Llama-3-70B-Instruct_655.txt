SUMMARY:
The Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was cancelled due to his biblical views on marriage, deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labelled him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter, stating he is coming to the UK to present the Gospel, not to condemn the LGBTQ community. He acknowledged that he views homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that God sees all humans as sinners in need of forgiveness and cleansing. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying his message is "inclusive" and comes from a place of "love." He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome." END OF SUMMARY.
