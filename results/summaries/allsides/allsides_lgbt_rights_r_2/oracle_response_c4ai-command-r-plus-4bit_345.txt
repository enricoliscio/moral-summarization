SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his scheduled speaking event at a venue in Liverpool, UK, cancelled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed "incompatible with our values" by venue officials. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham's appearance, calling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love, not hate, and that while he believes homosexuality is a sin, he also believes that everyone, including himself, is a sinner in need of forgiveness. He defended his right to free speech and religious liberty, emphasizing the inclusiveness of the Gospel message. Graham invited members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events, welcoming them despite their differences.
