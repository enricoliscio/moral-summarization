SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, had a speaking event scheduled at ACC Liverpool as part of his UK tour. However, the venue cancelled the event due to Graham's views on marriage, which they deemed "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman sparked protests, with some labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham wrote an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that he views homosexuality as a sin, but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is inclusive and he is coming out of love, not hate. He invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events, saying they are "absolutely welcome."
