Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let's read through the article first.

The article is about Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, who was scheduled to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled. The reason given by ACC Liverpool is that his views on marriage being between one man and one woman are incompatible with their values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. 

Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, saying he's not there to condemn them but to share the Gospel. He admits he sees homosexuality as a sin but emphasizes that everyone is a sinner and needs forgiveness. He also defends free speech and religious liberty, stating he's coming out of love, not hate, and welcomes LGBTQ individuals to his events.

Now, I need to capture the main points: cancellation of the event due to Graham's views, protests, his response, and his stance on homosexuality as a sin while promoting inclusion through the Gospel.

I should structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to highlight the moral conflict between Graham's beliefs and the venue's values, the protests, and his defense of his actions.

Let me start drafting:

"Rev. Franklin Graham's speaking event in Liverpool was canceled due to his biblical stance on marriage, which the venue deemed incompatible with their values. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized him as a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by stating he aims to share the Gospel, not condemn LGBTQ individuals, though he maintains homosexuality is a sin. He emphasized the inclusive nature of the Gospel and his belief in free speech and religious liberty, inviting the LGBTQ community to attend his events."

I think that covers the key points while maintaining the moral framing. It's concise and under 200 words.
