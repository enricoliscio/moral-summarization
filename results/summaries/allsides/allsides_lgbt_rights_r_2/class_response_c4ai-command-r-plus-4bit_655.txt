SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, was disinvited from speaking at a venue in Liverpool due to his biblical views on marriage being deemed "incompatible" with the values of the venue's officials. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, rebuked the venue for allowing Graham to share his message, referring to him as "a homophobic hate preacher." In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he comes from a place of love and is not speaking against anybody. He affirmed his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that everyone is welcome at his events. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty in his letter.

END OF SUMMARY.
