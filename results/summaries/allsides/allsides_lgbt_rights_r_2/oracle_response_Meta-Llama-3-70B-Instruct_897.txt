SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool was canceled due to his biblical views on marriage, deemed "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled him a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham replied with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he's coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn them. He acknowledged that the Bible defines homosexuality as a "sin," but emphasized that all humans are "guilty of sin" and in need of forgiveness. Graham defended free speech and religious liberty, saying the Gospel is "inclusive" and he's coming out of "love," not "hate." He extended a welcome to the LGBTQ community to attend his events.

Graham's views were met with opposition, with critics accusing him of promoting "homophobic" and "hateful" ideologies. However, Graham maintained that his message is one of love and inclusivity, emphasizing the importance of forgiveness and redemption. The cancellation of his event raises questions about the balance between religious liberty and the protection of marginalized groups.
