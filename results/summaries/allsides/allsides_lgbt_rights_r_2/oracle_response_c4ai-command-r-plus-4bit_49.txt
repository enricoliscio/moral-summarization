SUMMARY: Evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the late preacher Billy Graham, has had his speaking engagement at a Liverpool venue canceled due to his views on homosexuality being deemed incompatible with the values of the venue. Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, labeled Graham a "homophobic hate preacher" due to his biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In response, Graham penned an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating that he is coming to the U.K. to present the Gospel, not to condemn anyone. While admitting that he does view homosexuality as a sin, Graham emphasized that the Gospel is inclusive and that he is coming out of love, not hate. He also defended free speech and religious liberty, inviting members of the LGBTQ community to attend his events. Graham's stance reflects a moral framework that sees homosexuality as a sin, with associated guilt, penalties, and separation from God, while also emphasizing the inclusive nature of the Gospel and his own message of love and welcome.
