SUMMARY:

Rev. Franklin Graham's event at ACC Liverpool has been cancelled due to his views on marriage being "incompatible with our values." Graham's biblical interpretation of marriage as a union between one man and one woman sparked criticism, with some labeling him a "homophobic hate preacher." Despite this, Graham replied to the decision, penning an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he is coming to the UK not to condemn them, but to present the Gospel. He acknowledged that God defines homosexuality as a "sin," but emphasized that all humans are sinners in need of "forgiveness and cleansing." Graham defended the right to free speech and religious "liberty," asserting that the Gospel is "inclusive" and he is coming out of "love," not hate. He extended an invitation to the LGBTQ community, saying they are "absolutely welcome" to attend his events. The cancellation of Graham's event raises questions about the limits of free speech and the tension between religious beliefs and societal values.

END OF SUMMARY.
