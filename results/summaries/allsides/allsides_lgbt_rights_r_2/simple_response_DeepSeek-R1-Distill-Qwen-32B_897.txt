Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical aspects and the opposing viewpoints.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Rev. Franklin Graham was supposed to speak in Liverpool but the event was canceled because his views on marriage are seen as incompatible with the venue's values. There were protests, including from the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, calling him a homophobic hate preacher. Graham responded by saying he's coming to present the Gospel, not to condemn, and that he believes homosexuality is a sin but everyone is welcome.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Graham's beliefs and the venue's values. Mention the cancellation, the protests, Graham's response, and his stance on homosexuality as a sin while emphasizing inclusion. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

I'll start by stating the cancellation, then the reason given by the venue. Include the protests and the network's criticism. Then, detail Graham's response, his open letter, his belief in homosexuality as a sin, and his emphasis on love and inclusion. Conclude with his invitation to the LGBTQ community.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Avoid any personal opinions, just present the facts and the moral perspectives from both sides.

SUMMARY:  
Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelical preacher and son of Billy Graham, was scheduled to speak at ACC Liverpool as part of his U.K. tour. However, the event was canceled due to the venue's decision that Graham's biblical view of marriage as a union between one man and one woman was "incompatible with our values." Protesters, including the Liverpool Labour LGBT Network, criticized Graham as a "homophobic hate preacher." Graham responded with an open letter to the LGBTQ community, stating he was not there to condemn them but to share the Gospel, which he described as inclusive. He acknowledged his belief that homosexuality is a sin but emphasized that everyone, including himself, is a sinner in need of forgiveness. Graham also defended free speech and religious liberty, insisting he came out of love, not hate, and invited the LGBTQ community to attend his events. The cancellation reflects a clash between religious beliefs and progressive values, highlighting tensions over free expression and inclusion.  
END OF SUMMARY.
