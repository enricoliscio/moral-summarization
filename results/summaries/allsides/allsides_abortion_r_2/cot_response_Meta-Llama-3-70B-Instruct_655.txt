SUMMARY:
President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, calling unborn children "wonderfully made" and slamming Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. The March for Life aims to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that discontent over U.S. abortion policy is at an all-time high, with 58% of Americans dissatisfied and only 32% satisfied. The survey found that Democrats and independents are increasingly in favor of less restrictive abortion laws, while Republicans want stricter laws. Despite this, many Americans support some state abortion restrictions, but criminalizing abortion remains unpopular. Trump's administration has been a "consistent champion for life," appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. END OF SUMMARY.
