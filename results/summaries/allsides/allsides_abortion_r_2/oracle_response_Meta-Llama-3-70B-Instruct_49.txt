SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he declared that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House." He slammed Democrats for embracing "the most radical and extreme positions" and backing "taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth." Trump's administration has been a consistent champion for life, appointing anti-abortion judges and federal workers, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions, and calling for an end to late-term abortions. A new Gallup poll shows that discontent over U.S. abortion policy is at an all-time high, with 58% of respondents dissatisfied and only 32% satisfied. The March for Life's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion." Trump's support for the March for Life has been unwavering, and his administration has been a strong defender of life.
