SUMMARY: President Trump spoke at the annual March for Life rally, becoming the first U.S. president to do so in person. He criticized Democrats for their stance on abortion and highlighted his administration's anti-abortion efforts. A recent Gallup poll showed record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people favoring less strict policies. The poll also found that dissatisfaction with abortion laws has increased since Trump took office, possibly due to his rhetoric and the rise in abortion restrictions. A separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority of Americans support the legality of abortion and want to keep Roe v. Wade in place, but many also support certain restrictions. Another poll by NPR/PBS News/Marist showed similar results, with a majority wanting to keep Roe but with additional restrictions. These polls reflect a complex and evolving landscape of abortion attitudes in the U.S.
END OF SUMMARY.
