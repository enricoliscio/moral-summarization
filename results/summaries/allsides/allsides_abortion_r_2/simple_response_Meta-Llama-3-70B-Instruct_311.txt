SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, emphasizing his commitment to protecting unborn children. He criticized Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth," and praised his administration's efforts to appoint anti-abortion judges and cut taxpayer funding for abortions. A new Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with 58% of respondents unhappy with current policies. While Democrats and independents increasingly want less restrictive laws, many Americans still support some state abortion restrictions. The poll also found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and nearly seven in 10 respondents don't want Roe v. Wade overturned. Trump's strong stance on the issue aligns with the moral framing of the March for Life, which seeks to promote the dignity and beauty of every human life by working to end abortion.
