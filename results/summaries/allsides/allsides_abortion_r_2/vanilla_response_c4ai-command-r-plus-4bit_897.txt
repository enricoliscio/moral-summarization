SUMMARY: President Trump became the first president to attend and speak at the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally. In his speech, he criticized Democrats for their support of abortion rights and highlighted his administration's efforts to restrict abortion access, including appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. A recent Gallup poll found record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people wanting less strict policies. The survey also showed a shift towards less restrictive abortion laws since Trump took office, with an increasing number of Democrats and independents expressing this view. The Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that a majority of Americans support the legalization of abortion in most or all cases and oppose the overturning of Roe v. Wade. However, many also support certain restrictions on abortion, such as requiring hospital-admitting privileges for providers. Another poll by NPR/PBS News/Marist showed that while most Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade in place, many also want additional restrictions or changes.
END OF SUMMARY.
