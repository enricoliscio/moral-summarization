SUMMARY:
President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. He claimed that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House," citing the Bible's message that each person is "wonderfully made." The March for Life aims to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, with 58% wanting change. While some want stricter laws, many Democrats and independents are fueling a trend towards less restrictive policies. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. END OF SUMMARY.
