SUMMARY: President Trump spoke at the annual March for Life rally, becoming the first president to do so in person. He criticized Democrats for their stance on abortion and highlighted his administration's anti-abortion efforts. A recent Gallup poll showed record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people wanting less restrictive policies. The survey also found a shift in attitudes since Trump took office, with more people now favoring less strict abortion laws. Another poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans support the legalization of abortion in most or all cases and oppose the overturning of Roe v. Wade. However, many also support certain restrictions on abortion. A similar poll by NPR/PBS News/Marist also showed a majority in favor of keeping Roe v. Wade with some modifications. These findings reflect a complex and evolving landscape of abortion attitudes in the U.S.
END OF SUMMARY.
