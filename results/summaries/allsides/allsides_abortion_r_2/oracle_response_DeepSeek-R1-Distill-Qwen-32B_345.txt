Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article is about President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is an anti-abortion event. The key points are Trump's speech, the Gallup poll showing high dissatisfaction with abortion laws, and the public's mixed views on abortion restrictions.

First, I should identify the morally framed words the author used: defender, tells, made, abortion, working, end, champions, support. I need to include these words in the summary. 

President Trump is portrayed as a defender of unborn children, so I'll use that. He references the Bible, saying each person is wonderfully made, which is a moral statement. The March for Life works to end abortion, so I'll include that. Trump criticizes Democrats for extreme positions on abortion funding, which is another moral angle.

The Gallup poll shows record dissatisfaction, so I'll note that. The shift in public opinion is from wanting stricter laws to wanting less restrictive ones, especially among Democrats and independents. This reflects the moral debate over abortion policies.

I should also mention the support for Roe v. Wade and the mixed feelings about additional restrictions, like ultrasound requirements and waiting periods. It's important to highlight that while many want to keep Roe, they also support some restrictions, showing a nuanced moral stance.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to include Trump's role as a defender, the rally's mission, the poll results, and the public's mixed support for abortion policies. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the morally framed words are preserved.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all key points with the specified moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, becoming the first sitting president to attend in person. He positioned himself as a "defender" of unborn children and criticized Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion." The rally's mission is to "end abortion" and promote the "dignity of every human life." Trump's administration has been praised by the rally's president for appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting funding for abortions. A new Gallup poll reveals record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with growing support for less-restrictive policies, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 70% oppose overturning Roe v. Wade. However, many also support specific restrictions, such as ultrasound requirements and waiting periods. The moral debate over abortion continues to divide the nation, with Trump's rhetoric and policies further polarizing the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
