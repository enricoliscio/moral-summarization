SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump claimed that unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House and quoted the Bible, saying each person is "wonderfully made." A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with current abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied, a record low. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, a separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and nearly seven in 10 respondents don't want the landmark Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade to be overturned.

END OF SUMMARY.
