SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally in person, claiming that unborn children have never had a stronger advocate in the White House. He criticized Democrats for their support of abortion rights, including taxpayer-funded abortions. Trump's attendance and comments align with his administration's consistent anti-abortion stance, which has been reflected in policy decisions such as appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. A recent Gallup poll indicates record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a notable shift since 2017 towards a desire for less strict legislation. This shift is driven by Democrats and independents, and coincides with an increase in abortion restrictions at the state level. While a majority of Americans support the right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade, many also favor certain restrictions, revealing a complex and evolving moral landscape surrounding abortion in the U.S.

END OF SUMMARY.
