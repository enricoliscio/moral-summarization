Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is anti-abortion. He's the first president to do so in person. He mentions unborn children being defended and references the Bible, which adds a moral angle. He criticizes Democrats for supporting taxpayer-funded abortions, which is a political and moral stance.

The March for Life's mission is to promote the beauty and dignity of life by ending abortion. They've praised Trump for appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting funding. The article then mentions a Gallup poll showing high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with more people wanting less restrictive policies. This shift started under Trump's presidency, influenced by Democrats and independents.

The article also talks about states enacting restrictive laws, some blocked in court, and the Supreme Court case on abortion provider requirements. Public opinion shows support for Roe v. Wade but also some restrictions, like waiting periods and ultrasounds, though criminalizing abortion isn't popular.

I need to capture the moral framing, especially Trump's pro-life stance and the poll reflecting changing public opinion. I should mention the rally, his speech, the poll results, and the public's mixed support for abortion policies.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's speech, the rally's purpose, the poll findings, the state laws, and public opinion on Roe and restrictions. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral aspects are highlighted.
