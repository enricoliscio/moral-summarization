SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, emphasizing his administration's commitment to protecting unborn children. He criticized Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion" and "extreme positions" on the issue. A new Gallup poll shows that a record-high 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, with many wanting less restrictive policies. However, the poll also found that a significant number of respondents support some state abortion restrictions. The March for Life rally aims to promote the dignity and beauty of every human life and end abortion. Trump's administration has taken steps to restrict abortion, including appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
