SUMMARY:
President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "the most radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump stated that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House" and emphasized the importance of protecting life, citing the Bible's teaching that each person is "wonderfully made." The March for Life aims to promote the "beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that discontent with U.S. abortion laws has reached an all-time high, with 58% of Americans dissatisfied and only 32% satisfied. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Despite this, many Americans still support some state abortion restrictions, such as requiring hospital-admitting privileges for providers. END OF SUMMARY.
