SUMMARY:
President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. He emphasized that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House" and quoted the Bible, saying "each person is wonderfully made." The March for Life aims to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, with 58% wanting changes. While Democrats and independents want less restrictive laws, many also support some state abortion restrictions. Trump's administration has been a "consistent champion for life," appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. END OF SUMMARY.
