Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is an anti-abortion event. He's the first president to do that in person. He talked about unborn children and criticized Democrats for supporting taxpayer-funded abortions. The March for Life's mission is to end abortion.

There's also a new Gallup poll mentioned. It says that 58% of people are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, which is a record high. Satisfaction is at 32%, the lowest ever. The poll found that more people now want less restrictive abortion policies compared to before. This shift is mainly among Democrats and independents. 

The article also mentions that several states have passed restrictive abortion laws, but many are blocked in court. The Supreme Court is reviewing a case about abortion providers needing hospital admitting privileges. Previously, a similar Texas law was struck down.

Another poll from Kaiser Family Foundation shows that most Americans think abortion should be legal in most or all cases. However, many support some restrictions like waiting periods or ultrasound requirements. But criminalizing abortion isn't popular.

So, the main points are:
- Trump's speech at the rally, first in person.
- Record-high dissatisfaction with abortion laws.
- Shift towards wanting less restrictive policies.
- State laws and Supreme Court case.
- Public opinion on abortion legality and restrictions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include Trump's speech, the poll results, the shift in public opinion, state laws, and the Supreme Court case. Also, mention the Kaiser poll findings about legality and restrictions. Keep it concise and clear.
