Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally framed words provided: defender, tells, made, abortion, working, end, champions, support. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump spoke at the March for Life rally, emphasizing his support for anti-abortion policies. He criticized Democrats and highlighted his administration's actions, like appointing judges and cutting funding. The article also mentions a Gallup poll showing high dissatisfaction with abortion laws, with a shift towards wanting less restrictive policies, especially among Democrats and independents. There's also data from other polls about public opinion on abortion legality and specific restrictions.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points while using the specified moral terms. I'll start by noting Trump's role as a defender and champion of life, referencing the March for Life's mission. I'll mention the poll results to show the shift in public opinion, using terms like 'working to end' abortion. I should also include the statistics about support for Roe v. Wade and the specific restrictions people back, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's stance, the poll findings, and the public's mixed support for abortion laws. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward, focusing on the moral aspects as emphasized in the original article.

SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, emphasizing his administration's role as a "defender" and "champion" of life, while criticizing Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion." The rally's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion." A new Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with growing support for less-restrictive policies, particularly among Democrats and independents. The poll also reveals that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 57% of Republicans want to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many respondents support certain restrictions, such as requiring doctors to have hospital admitting privileges or ultrasound requirements, but criminalizing abortion remains unpopular. Trump's administration has appointed anti-abortion judges, cut taxpayer funding for abortions, and called for an end to late-term abortions, aligning with the March for Life's mission to "end abortion." END OF SUMMARY.
