SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he proclaimed that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House." He slammed Democrats for embracing "the most radical and extreme positions" and backing "taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth." The March for Life's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion." Trump's administration has been a consistent champion for life, appointing anti-abortion judges and federal workers, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions, and calling for an end to late-term abortions. A new Gallup poll shows that discontent over U.S. abortion policy is at an all-time high, with 58% of respondents wanting stricter or less restrictive laws. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents.
