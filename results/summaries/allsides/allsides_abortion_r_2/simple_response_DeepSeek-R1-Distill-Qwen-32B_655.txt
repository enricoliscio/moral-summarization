Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article starts with President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is an anti-abortion event. He's the first president to do so in person. He emphasizes his support for unborn children and criticizes Democrats for supporting extreme abortion policies. The rally's mission is to promote life and end abortion.

Then, it mentions that the Trump administration has appointed anti-abortion judges and cut funding for abortions. The March for Life president, Jeanne Mancini, praises Trump for his consistent support.

Next, a Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with 58% dissatisfied and 32% satisfied. This is a shift from previous years where dissatisfaction usually led to wanting stricter laws. Now, more people want less restrictive laws, especially among Democrats and independents.

The article also talks about states enacting restrictive laws, some of which have been blocked in court. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case related to abortion provider requirements. Public opinion is split, with many supporting some restrictions but opposing criminalization.

I need to capture the moral elements: Trump's pro-life stance, the criticism of Democrats, the rally's mission, the poll results showing a shift, and the public's mixed support for restrictions. I should structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, making sure to include the moral framing around pro-life vs. abortion rights and the public's changing opinions.
