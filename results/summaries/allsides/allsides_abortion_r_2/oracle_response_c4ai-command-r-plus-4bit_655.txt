SUMMARY: President Trump spoke at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, becoming the first president to attend in person. He claimed to be a defender of "unborn children" and criticized Democrats for their support of abortion access. The March for Life's president, Jeanne Mancini, praised the Trump administration for their anti-abortion efforts, including appointing judges and federal workers who oppose abortion and cutting taxpayer funding for the procedure. A recent Gallup poll showed record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people favoring less strict policies. The survey also found that many Americans support some restrictions on abortion, such as requiring admitting privileges for providers and mandatory waiting periods. However, most Americans do not want Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling protecting abortion rights, to be overturned. While there is support for some restrictions, criminalizing abortion for providers and seekers is largely unpopular. The article highlights the complex and evolving nature of abortion policy preferences in the United States.
