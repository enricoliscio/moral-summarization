SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally on Friday, declaring himself a defender of "unborn children" and criticizing Democrats for their stance on abortion. Trump's speech aligns with the March for Life mission to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion." This comes amid a Gallup poll indicating record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people favoring less strict abortion policies. The poll also highlights a divide between Democrats and Republicans, with a majority of Republicans wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade, which affirmed the right to abortion. However, another poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans support the legality of abortion in most or all cases, and a significant number also endorse certain restrictions on abortion. The article also mentions the Trump administration's efforts to appoint anti-abortion judges and federal workers, cut funding for abortions, and ban late-term abortions. These actions reinforce the administration's consistent support for the March for Life and their stance as champions for the "beauty and dignity of human life."
END OF SUMMARY.
