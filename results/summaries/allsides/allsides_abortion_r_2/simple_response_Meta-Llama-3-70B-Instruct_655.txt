SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump emphasized that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House" and quoted the Bible, saying "each person is wonderfully made." A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has increased, particularly among Democrats and independents. Despite this, many Americans still support some state abortion restrictions, such as requiring hospital-admitting privileges for providers. The moral imperative to protect the dignity and beauty of every human life, as emphasized by the March for Life, is clear.
