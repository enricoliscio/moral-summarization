SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump praised his administration's efforts to restrict abortion, including appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding. A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, a separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and nearly seven in 10 respondents don't want the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling to be overturned.

END OF SUMMARY.
