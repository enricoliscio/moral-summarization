SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump praised his administration's efforts to restrict abortion, including appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Another poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases. However, many respondents also backed some state abortion restrictions, such as requiring hospital-admitting privileges for doctors. The polls suggest a complex and divided public opinion on abortion.

END OF SUMMARY.
