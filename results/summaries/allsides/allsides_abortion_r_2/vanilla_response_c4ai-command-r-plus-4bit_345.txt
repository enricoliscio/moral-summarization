SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally in person, becoming the first president to do so. He criticized Democrats for their stance on abortion and highlighted his administration's anti-abortion efforts. The March for Life aims to end abortion and promote the value of human life. A recent Gallup poll showed record dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing desire for less restrictive policies. The survey also revealed a shift in Democrats' and independents' views, aligning with an increase in abortion restrictions under the Trump administration. Another poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans support the legality of abortion and oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, but many also favor certain state abortion restrictions. A similar NPR/PBS News/Marist poll showed a preference for additional abortion restrictions while retaining Roe v. Wade. These findings reflect the complex and evolving nature of public opinion on abortion in the United States.
