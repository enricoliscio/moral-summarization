SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. He also touted his administration's anti-abortion efforts, including appointing judges and cutting taxpayer funding for abortions. A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied, a record low. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, a separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 11% think it should be illegal in all cases. Many respondents also backed some state abortion restrictions, but criminalizing abortion remained unpopular.

END OF SUMMARY.
