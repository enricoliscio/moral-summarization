SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally in person, emphasizing his stance against abortion and criticizing Democrats for their support of "radical and extreme" positions. The march, which promotes the "beauty and dignity of human life," has seen increasing support, with a record-high dissatisfaction with US abortion laws. The Gallup poll revealed that dissatisfaction with abortion policies has grown since 2017, under the Trump administration, with a notable shift towards favoring less strict laws. This shift is attributed to Democrats' and independents' views that abortion laws are too restrictive. The article also highlights the divide between Democrats and Republicans on the issue, with a majority of Republicans favoring the overturning of Roe v. Wade, while Democrats and independents want to maintain or expand abortion rights. Additionally, while Americans support some abortion restrictions, criminalizing abortion for providers and seekers is largely unpopular. Trump's attendance at the march and his administration's actions, including appointing anti-abortion judges, reflect his consistent stance against abortion. 

END OF SUMMARY.
