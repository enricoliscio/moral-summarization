Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words: defender, tells, made, abortion, working, end, champions, support. I should make sure to include these words where appropriate.

First, the article talks about Trump speaking at the March for Life rally. He called himself a defender of unborn children. I'll note that. He referenced the Bible, saying each person is wonderfully made. That's a moral point, so I'll include "wonderfully made."

Next, he criticized Democrats for extreme positions on abortion, specifically taxpayer-funded abortions. I'll mention that, but also note that critics dispute this. 

The March for Life's mission is to promote the beauty and dignity of life by ending abortion. They've praised Trump for his support, like appointing anti-abortion judges and cutting funding. I'll use "champions" here.

The Gallup poll shows high dissatisfaction with abortion laws, 58%, and low satisfaction, 32%. There's a shift towards wanting less restrictive laws, especially among Democrats and independents. This trend started when Trump took office.

The article also mentions states enacting restrictive laws, some blocked in court. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Louisiana law. Public opinion shows support for Roe v. Wade but also some restrictions, like waiting periods and ultrasounds. Criminalizing abortion isn't popular.

I'll structure the summary to include all these points, using the moral words where they fit. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while preserving the author's moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, becoming the first president to speak in person. He positioned himself as a "defender" of unborn children, citing the Bible to emphasize that "each person is wonderfully made." Trump criticized Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion," a claim disputed by critics. The rally's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion." The Trump administration has been praised for appointing anti-abortion judges, cutting funding for abortions, and opposing late-term procedures. A new Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with growing support for less-restrictive policies, particularly among Democrats and independents. States have recently passed restrictive laws, though many face legal challenges. Public opinion reflects a divide: most Americans want Roe v. Wade upheld, but many also support certain restrictions, such as waiting periods and ultrasound requirements. Fewer favor criminalizing abortion. END OF SUMMARY.
