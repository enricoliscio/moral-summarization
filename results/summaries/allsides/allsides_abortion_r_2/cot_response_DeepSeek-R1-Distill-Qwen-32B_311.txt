Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Let me read through the article again.

The article starts with President Trump speaking at the March for Life, an anti-abortion rally. Words like "anti-abortion" and "pro-life" are definitely moral terms. Trump calls unborn children "stronger defender" and mentions the Bible, which relates to moral values. He criticizes Democrats for "radical" and "extreme positions," which are moral judgments. The rally's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life," so those are moral words. They also mention "taxpayer-funded abortion," which has a moral implication. 

The article talks about the Gallup poll showing "record-high dissatisfaction" and "all-time high" and "all-time low" satisfaction, which are more about public opinion but could be framed morally. The poll mentions "less restrictive" and "stricter laws," which relate to moral stances on abortion. The states enacting "restrictive anti-abortion laws" is another moral term. The Supreme Court case is about "admitting privileges," which is a policy but has moral implications. 

The Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that most believe abortion should be "legal" in most or all cases, opposing "illegal" procedures. Wanting Roe v. Wade to stay or be "overturned" is a moral decision. The support for "state abortion restrictions" includes "waiting periods" and "ultrasound images," which are policy measures with moral backing. The opposition to "criminalizing abortion" is another moral stance. 

So, compiling all these, I need to list each moral word. Then, in the summary, I'll include as many as possible without making it too long. I should make sure the summary reflects both the pro-life stance of Trump and the rally, the poll results showing growing dissatisfaction and shifts in public opinion, and the various policies and court cases involved. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**
President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, emphasizing his administration's commitment to protecting unborn children and criticizing Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion." The rally aims to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life." A new Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing shift toward wanting less-restrictive policies. Since Trump's presidency, more Americans, especially Democrats and independents, favor less strict laws. Meanwhile, states have enacted restrictive anti-abortion laws, though many face legal challenges. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 59% believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 57% of Republicans want Roe v. Wade overturned. Many support some restrictions, like waiting periods and ultrasounds, but criminalizing abortion is unpopular. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. The summary highlights the moral divide over abortion, with Trump and his administration championing pro-life policies while public opinion increasingly favors less-restrictive approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
