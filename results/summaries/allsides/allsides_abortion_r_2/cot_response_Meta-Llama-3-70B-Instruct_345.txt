SUMMARY:
President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. Trump emphasized that "unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House" and quoted the Bible, saying "each person is wonderfully made." The March for Life aims to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that discontent with U.S. abortion laws is at an all-time high, with 58% of Americans dissatisfied and only 32% satisfied. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, many states have enacted restrictive anti-abortion laws, which have been blocked in court. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. END OF SUMMARY.
