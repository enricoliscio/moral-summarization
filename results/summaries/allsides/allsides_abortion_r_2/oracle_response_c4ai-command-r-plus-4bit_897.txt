SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the annual March for Life rally in person, becoming the first US president to do so. In his speech, he positioned himself as a defender of the unborn, quoting the Bible to support his stance against abortion. He criticized Democrats for their stance on abortion, specifically their support for taxpayer-funded abortions. The March for Life movement aims to end abortion by promoting the dignity of human life. Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, praised the Trump administration for its consistent support and actions in appointing anti-abortion judges and federal workers, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions, and advocating for an end to late-term abortions. A recent Gallup poll indicated record-high dissatisfaction with US abortion laws, with an increasing number of people favoring less strict abortion policies since Trump took office. This shift in opinion is driven by Democrats and independents. The article also highlights the growing support for state-level abortion restrictions and notes that a majority of Republicans favor overturning Roe v. Wade, while a significant number of Americans support keeping it with additional restrictions.

END OF SUMMARY.
