SUMMARY: President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the annual March for Life anti-abortion rally, where he criticized Democrats for their stance on abortion. The event's president, Jeanne Mancini, praised the Trump administration for its anti-abortion actions and appointments. A recent Gallup poll showed record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with a growing number of people wanting less restrictive policies. The poll also revealed a shift in opinions, with more Democrats and independents favoring less strict abortion laws. This shift coincided with an increase in state-level abortion restrictions and the Trump administration's rhetoric on the issue. A separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most Americans support the legalization of abortion in most or all cases and oppose overturning Roe v. Wade. However, many also support certain restrictions on abortion, such as requiring hospital-admitting privileges for providers. Another poll by NPR/PBS News/Marist showed similar results, with a majority wanting to keep Roe v. Wade but with additional restrictions.
END OF SUMMARY.
