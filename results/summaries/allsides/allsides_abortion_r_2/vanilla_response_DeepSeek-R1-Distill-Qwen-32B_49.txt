Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is an anti-abortion event. He's the first president to do so in person. He criticized Democrats for supporting taxpayer-funded abortions, which some say don't actually happen. The rally's mission is to end abortion by promoting the value of human life.

The article also mentions a new Gallup poll showing record-high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws, with 58% dissatisfied and 32% satisfied. There's a shift where more people now want less restrictive laws, especially among Democrats and independents. States have passed restrictive laws, but many are blocked in court. The Supreme Court is reviewing a Louisiana law related to abortion providers needing hospital admitting privileges.

Additionally, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that most Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and a majority don't want Roe v. Wade overturned. However, there's support for some restrictions like waiting periods and ultrasound requirements.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump speaking at the rally, mention the poll results, the shift in public opinion, state laws, the Supreme Court case, and the Kaiser poll findings. I should make sure to include key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Trump attends March for Life, first president to do so. He criticized Democrats. The rally's mission. Gallup poll shows high dissatisfaction, shift towards less restrictive laws. State laws and Supreme Court case. Kaiser poll results on Roe and restrictions. End with the shift in public opinion and ongoing debates.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main points without being too lengthy. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.
