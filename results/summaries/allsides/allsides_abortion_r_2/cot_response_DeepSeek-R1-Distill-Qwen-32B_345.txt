Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "anti-abortion," "defender," "radical," "extreme," "taxpayer-funded," "champions," "dignity," "restrictive," "strict," "unconstitutional," "criminalizing," "pro-life," "pro-choice," and "landmark." These words are important because they reflect the moral stance of the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning President Trump's speech at the March for Life rally, highlighting his moral stance. I'll include the Gallup poll results to show public sentiment, making sure to note the shift towards wanting less restrictive laws, which is a moral issue. I'll also touch on the Supreme Court cases and the public's mixed views on abortion restrictions, using terms like "pro-life" and "pro-choice." Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the support for Roe v. Wade but also the desire for some restrictions, keeping the moral framing intact throughout.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the key points without getting too detailed. It's important to maintain the moral perspective as the original article did, so I'll focus on the language that conveys the ethical dimensions of the issue. Let me put it all together, ensuring each point is clear and the moral terms are appropriately included.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, emphasizing his administration's commitment to protecting unborn children and opposing taxpayer-funded abortion. The rally, which promotes the dignity of human life, saw Trump praise his record on anti-abortion policies, including appointing judges and cutting funding for abortions. A new Gallup poll revealed record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with many now favoring less-restrictive policies, a shift driven by Democrats and independents. Despite this, many respondents supported certain restrictions, such as requiring doctors to have hospital admitting privileges or ultrasound requirements. Meanwhile, criminalizing abortion remains unpopular. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case on abortion restrictions, highlighting ongoing debates over pro-life and pro-choice values. While most Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade intact, many also support additional restrictions, reflecting the nation's divided stance on abortion policy.
