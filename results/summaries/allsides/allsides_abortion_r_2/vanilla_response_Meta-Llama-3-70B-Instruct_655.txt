SUMMARY:

President Trump became the first president to speak in person at the anti-abortion March for Life rally, where he slammed Democrats for embracing "radical and extreme positions" on abortion. A new Gallup poll shows that 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with US abortion laws, a record high, while 32% are satisfied, a record low. The poll also found that support for easing abortion policy has risen, particularly among Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, a separate poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and 69% support policies requiring doctors to have hospital-admitting privileges. Despite this, many respondents also backed some state abortion restrictions. The Supreme Court will hear arguments this year on a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.

END OF SUMMARY.
