Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The author used certain morally charged words, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I need to read through the article carefully. It's about President Trump speaking at the March for Life rally, which is anti-abortion. The article mentions a Gallup poll showing high dissatisfaction with U.S. abortion laws. Trump is portrayed as a defender of unborn children, and the March for Life's mission is to end abortion, promoting the dignity of every human life.

I should note the key points: Trump's speech, the March for Life's mission, the poll results, the shift in public opinion towards wanting less restrictive policies, and the legal challenges surrounding abortion laws. Also, the article mentions support for Roe v. Wade but with some wanting additional restrictions.

Now, I need to summarize this in 200 words or less, using the morally framed words: defender, tells, made, abortion, working, end, champions, support. I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's stance as a defender, the mission to end abortion, the administration's support for anti-abortion policies, and the public's mixed feelings on abortion laws.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, starts with Trump's speech, mentions the poll, the shift in public opinion, the legal challenges, and the mixed support for Roe v. Wade. I should also include the Gallup findings about the increase in wanting less restrictive laws, especially among Democrats and independents.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all the key points and the morally framed words. I should check the word count to stay under 200 words. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together concisely, ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump addressed the anti-abortion March for Life rally, becoming the first sitting president to speak in person. He declared himself a "defender" of unborn children and criticized Democrats for supporting "taxpayer-funded abortion." The rally's mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life" by working to end abortion. Trump's administration has appointed anti-abortion judges, cut taxpayer funding for abortions, and called for an end to late-term abortions. A new Gallup poll shows record-high dissatisfaction (58%) with U.S. abortion laws, with 22% wanting less-restrictive policies and 24% wanting stricter laws. Since Trump took office, support for less-restrictive abortion policies has risen, driven by Democrats and independents. Meanwhile, many states have enacted restrictive abortion laws, though many remain blocked in court. Public opinion on abortion is mixed: 59% believe it should be legal in most or all cases, while 57% of Republicans want to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many also support some state restrictions, such as requiring doctors to have hospital admitting privileges or ultrasound descriptions. However, criminalizing abortion remains unpopular. END OF SUMMARY.
