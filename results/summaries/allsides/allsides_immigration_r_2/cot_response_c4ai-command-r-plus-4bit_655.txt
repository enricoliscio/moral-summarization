SUMMARY: The article discusses the decision of Texas Governor Greg Abbott to refuse refugee resettlement in his state, citing the "disproportionate" impact of the federal government's "broken" immigration system. Abbott's decision has been met with moral outrage, with critics calling it "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." The decision has been framed as going against American values of "welcoming" those in need and as being prompted by "xenophobia and fear." The article counters these moral judgments by arguing that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, creating a vacuum that draws billions and impacting social services, infrastructure, and social fabric. It questions the morality of encouraging migration instead of helping those in need in their home countries. The article also criticizes the downplaying of numbers by immigration proponents and warns of a tipping point where socialist-leaning voters outnumber freedom-loving ones, fundamentally changing America. The debate centers on moral values, with critics accusing immigration hawks of being immoral and hawks questioning the morality of mass migration. The article concludes that the true moral course is to help those in need where they are, not encourage migration.
