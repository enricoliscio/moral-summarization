Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding to decline refugee resettlement. He cites the impact on the border state and the federal government's broken immigration system. Then, it mentions the backlash from critics, including Tom Steyer and The Washington Post, calling his decision inhumane and violating American values. An immigration group, RAICES Texas, accuses Abbott of xenophobia. The Dallas Morning News says Texas' reputation is tarnished.

The article then shifts to a broader debate about immigration, conflating refugees with other immigrants. It argues that mass migration strains destination countries and harms origin countries by taking their best people. The writer questions the morality of encouraging migration versus helping people in their home countries. They also criticize the lack of clear limits from immigration proponents and express concern about the future of America's identity.

So, the summary should cover Abbott's decision, the criticism, the broader debate on immigration's impact, and the moral arguments presented. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.
