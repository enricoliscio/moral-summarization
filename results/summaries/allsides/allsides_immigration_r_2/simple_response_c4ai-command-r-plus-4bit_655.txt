SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has refused to accept refugee resettlement in his state, citing the strain on resources from the federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has been met with outrage from the "woke police" and others who view it as immoral and inhumane. However, the author of this article argues that the moral high ground lies with those who oppose mass migration, as it creates a vacuum that encourages the most capable individuals to leave their home countries, ultimately worsening conditions there and straining the resources of the destination countries. The left's virtue-signaling ignores the negative impact of mass migration on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric, as well as the loss of talent in the countries of origin. The true moral course of action is to find ways to help those in need without encouraging migration. Critics who support immigration dismiss these arguments by downplaying the numbers, but the author warns that a tipping point will eventually be reached, threatening the freedom-loving values that America holds dear.
END OF SUMMARY.
