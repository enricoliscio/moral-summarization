SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. The decision has sparked outrage from critics, who accuse Abbott of being "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the article argues that proponents of mass migration are responsible for creating a system that encourages the strong and wealthy to leave their countries of origin, leading to a brain drain and negatively impacting the countries they flee from. The article also questions the moral high ground of those who support immigration, suggesting that it is not the most effective way to help those in need. Instead, it proposes finding ways to help people in their own countries, rather than encouraging migration.

END OF SUMMARY.
