SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has refused to accept refugee resettlement, citing the disproportionate impact on his state due to the federal government's broken immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from those who view it as inhumane and violating American values. However, the author of this article argues that mass migration has negative consequences for both destination and origin countries. They believe that encouraging migration is not the true moral course of action, but rather finding ways to help people and their countries right where they are. The article also criticizes establishment 'conservatives' and leftist Democrats who advocate for an immigration system overhaul, warning that a tipping point will be reached where socialist-leaning voters will outnumber freedom-loving ones, and America will cease to be America. The author concludes that the moral high ground belongs to those who oppose mass migration, as it creates a vacuum that draws billions and has detrimental effects on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric.
END OF SUMMARY.
