SUMMARY:

The article discusses Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement, citing the state's "broken" immigration system and the need to prioritize resources for existing residents, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer and columnists Monica Rhor and Catherine Rampell, have labeled the decision as "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." The author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage mass migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. They contend that proponents of mass immigration are causing harm to both destination and origin countries, leading to a decline in living standards and a loss of skilled individuals. The author suggests that the focus should be on helping those in need in their own countries, rather than encouraging migration. END OF SUMMARY.
