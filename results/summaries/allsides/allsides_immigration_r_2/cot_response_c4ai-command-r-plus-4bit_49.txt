SUMMARY: The decision by Texas Governor Greg Abbott to refuse refugee resettlement has sparked moral outrage, with critics calling it "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." Abbott cited the "disproportionate" impact on his border state due to the federal government's "broken" immigration system. However, his decision has been labeled as "xenophobic" and contrary to American values of welcoming those fleeing persecution. The article argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are two sides of the same coin, impacting social services and infrastructure. It questions the morality of mass migration, suggesting that it creates a vacuum, drawing billions and impacting the social fabric of both destination and origin countries. The author believes that helping those in need where they are is the true moral course of action. Critics are accused of downplaying the numbers and failing to acknowledge the potential strain on resources. The article concludes that while 20,000 refugees may not seem like an "invasion," a tipping point will be reached if establishment conservatives and leftist Democrats get their way, threatening America's freedom-loving values. The moral high ground in the immigration debate is contested, with critics arguing for the benefits of migration and the author emphasizing the potential harms. END OF SUMMARY.
