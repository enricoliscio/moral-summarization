Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding not to accept refugees, which has sparked a lot of criticism. The author uses several morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are:

1. Governor Abbott is the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the state's resources and the federal immigration system.
2. Critics, including Tom Steyer, The Washington Post, and others, are calling his decision inhumane, violating American values, and morally wrong, linking it to xenophobia.
3. The author argues against conflating refugees with other immigrants but then intentionally conflates them, discussing the negative impacts on both destination and origin countries.
4. The author questions the morality of mass migration, suggesting it harms both the countries people leave and the ones they go to, and criticizes the focus on bringing in refugees while neglecting domestic issues like homelessness.
5. The author also touches on political implications, fearing an influx of voters that could change the country's values.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words, using the morally framed words provided. I should make sure to include words like decline, resettlement, inhumane, violates, xenophobia, wrong, etc.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Abbott's decision and the criticism, then the author's counterarguments about migration's impact, and end with the political concerns. I need to keep it concise and include as many moral terms as possible without making it too wordy.

Let me draft the summary:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing resource constraints and federal immigration issues. Critics, including Tom Steyer and The Washington Post, labeled his decision inhumane and morally wrong, linking it to xenophobia. The author argues that mass migration strains destination countries and harms origin countries by depleting skilled workers. They question the morality of prioritizing refugees over domestic issues like homelessness and warn of political shifts from increased immigration.

Wait, that's under 200 words and includes several moral terms. Let me check if I used the required words. Yes, decline, resettlement, inhumane, wrong, xenophobia, strain, etc. I think this captures the essence while preserving the moral framing.
