SUMMARY: Critics of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to opt-out of refugee resettlement in his state have branded it as immoral and inhumane. They argue that it goes against American values and is shameful and xenophobic. However, the author of this article takes a different view, arguing that mass migration can have negative consequences for both the destination and origin countries. The strain on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric in destination countries and the brain drain in origin countries are among the issues raised. The article also questions the moral high ground of those who support mass migration, suggesting that encouraging migration may not be the most ethical solution. Instead, the focus should be on finding ways to help those in need and improve their home countries. While some may dismiss these concerns as an exaggeration of the impact of migration, the author believes that a tipping point will eventually be reached if mass migration continues unchecked, leading to a loss of America's unique character.
END OF SUMMARY.
