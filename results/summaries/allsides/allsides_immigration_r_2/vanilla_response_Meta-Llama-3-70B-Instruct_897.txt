SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. The decision has sparked outrage from critics, who accuse Abbott of being "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the article argues that mass migration can have negative consequences on both destination and origin countries, leading to a decline in living standards and a loss of skilled individuals. The author suggests that instead of encouraging migration, it is morally right to find effective ways to help people in need in their own countries. The article also criticizes proponents of mass immigration for downplaying the numbers and failing to provide a clear answer to when enough will be enough.

END OF SUMMARY.
