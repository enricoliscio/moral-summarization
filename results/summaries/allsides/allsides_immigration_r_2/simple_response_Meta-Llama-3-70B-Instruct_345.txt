SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has decided to opt out of refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer and columnists, have labeled the decision as "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration can lead to a vacuum that draws millions from around the world, causing strain on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric in destination countries, while origin countries lose their best people. The author suggests that instead of encouraging migration, we should focus on helping those in need in their own countries, and that the true moral high ground lies with those who prioritize the well-being of their own citizens.
