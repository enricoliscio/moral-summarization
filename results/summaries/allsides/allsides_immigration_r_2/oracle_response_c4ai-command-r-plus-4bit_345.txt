SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement has triggered a moral debate. Critics call it "inhumane," "violating American values," and "xenophobic." They argue that helping those fleeing war and persecution is fundamental to America's national character. Immigration hawks counter that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, straining social services and leading to brain drain. They argue that encouraging migration without addressing root causes is not morally superior to finding effective ways to help people in their home countries. The debate continues, with critics accusing hawks of conflating refugee resettlement with immigration and hawks asserting that the two are indeed linked. The moral high ground in this complex issue remains contested.

END OF SUMMARY.
