SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declined to accept refugee resettlement, citing the impact of the federal government's "broken" immigration system on his state. This decision has sparked criticism from some who view it as inhumane and contrary to American values. However, the author of this article argues that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, and that helping those in need should be done in their own countries. The article also criticizes "establishment 'conservatives'" and leftist Democrats who support mass migration, arguing that it will eventually lead to a tipping point where socialist-leaning voters outnumber freedom-loving ones. The author believes that this will fundamentally change America and that it is important to prioritize the needs of citizens over foreigners.

END OF SUMMARY.
