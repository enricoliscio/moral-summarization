Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's stance.

The article starts by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding to decline refugee resettlement, which has caused a lot of criticism from 'woke' groups and individuals. They're calling his decision inhumane and against American values. The author seems to support Abbott's decision and is critical of the critics.

The author argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are similar in that they both bring in people who might not easily assimilate and could strain resources. They mention that helping people in their home countries is better than encouraging migration, which can harm both the origin and destination countries. The author also criticizes the left for hypocrisy, comparing them to Hitler, which is a strong statement.

The article then discusses the potential negative impacts of mass migration, like overpopulation and the loss of skilled workers from origin countries. The author questions why cities with high homelessness, like Austin, are still taking in refugees. They suggest that the real moral action is to help people where they are, not bring them here.

The summary needs to capture the author's moral argument against resettlement and mass migration, highlighting the criticism from the left, the potential negative impacts, and the suggestion that helping in-country is better. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points without getting too bogged down in details.

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning Abbott's decision and the criticism it received. Then, outline the author's counterarguments: the link between refugees and immigration, the impact on both countries, and the moral stance of helping in-country. Finally, mention the criticism of the left's hypocrisy and the potential for overpopulation.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the author's perspective, which is critical of resettlement and mass migration, and supports helping people in their home countries. I need to keep it neutral in presentation but include the moral framing as presented.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing resource constraints and the federal government's immigration policies. His decision sparked criticism from 'woke' groups, who accused him of inhumanity and moral wrongdoing. The author defends Abbott, arguing that refugee resettlement and immigration are interconnected, both involving the movement of often unskilled, non-assimilable populations. They claim that mass migration harms both origin and destination countries, depleting skilled workers from poorer nations and straining resources in wealthier ones. The author suggests that the moral course is to help people in their home countries rather than encouraging migration. They criticize the left for hypocrisy, comparing their moralizing to Adolf Hitler's lectures on kindness. The article also questions the wisdom of resettling refugees when cities like Austin struggle with homelessness. The author warns that unchecked immigration could lead to overpopulation and cultural decline in the West. END OF SUMMARY.
