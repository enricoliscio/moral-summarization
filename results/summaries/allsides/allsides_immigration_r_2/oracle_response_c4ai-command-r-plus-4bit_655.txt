SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement has triggered criticism from those who perceive it as immoral and inhumane. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer and various commentators, accuse the governor of violating American values, xenophobia, and shirking the responsibility to welcome those fleeing war and persecution. Abbott cites the disproportionate impact on his border state and the need to prioritize resources for those already in Texas. The moral debate extends beyond refugee resettlement to immigration in general, with critics conflating the two issues. The article challenges the notion that mass migration is inherently virtuous, arguing that it can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries. It questions the impact of mass migration on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric, as well as the potential loss of talented individuals from countries of origin. The true moral course of action, the author suggests, is to find ways to help those in need without encouraging migration. The piece concludes by critiquing the lack of clear thresholds for immigration numbers and the potential threat to America's values and identity.
END OF SUMMARY.
