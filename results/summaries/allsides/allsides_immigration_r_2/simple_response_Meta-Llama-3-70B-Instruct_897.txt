SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer, have labeled the decision as "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration creates a vacuum that draws millions, leading to negative impacts on both destination and origin countries. The author questions why proponents of mass immigration prioritize helping foreigners over citizens, and why they fail to provide a number for when enough would be enough. The author concludes that the moral high ground belongs to those who prioritize the well-being of their own citizens and the integrity of their nation.
