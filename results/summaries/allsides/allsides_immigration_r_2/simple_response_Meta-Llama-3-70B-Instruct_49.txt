SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer, have labeled the decision as "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the author argues that the true moral high ground lies with those who oppose mass migration, as it creates a vacuum that draws millions of people from around the world, leading to negative impacts on both destination and origin countries. The author suggests that instead of encouraging migration, we should find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The article concludes that the real moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to help people and their countries where they are.
