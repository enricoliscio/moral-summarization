SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declined to accept refugee resettlement, citing the disproportionate impact on his state due to the federal government's broken immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from those who view it as inhumane and violating American values. Critics have accused Abbott of being shameful, morally wrong, and prompted by xenophobia and fear. However, the author of the article argues that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, and that helping those in need right where they are is the true moral course of action. The article also criticizes the downplaying of numbers by immigration proponents and warns of a tipping point that will be reached if establishment conservatives and leftist Democrats get their way. The author believes that this will lead to a vast number of socialist-leaning voters, causing America to cease to be America.
END OF SUMMARY.
