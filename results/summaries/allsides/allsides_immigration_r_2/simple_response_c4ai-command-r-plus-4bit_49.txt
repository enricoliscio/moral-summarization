SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has refused to accept refugee resettlement, citing the impact of the federal government's "broken" immigration system on his state. This decision has triggered criticism from those who view it as inhumane and violating American values. However, the author of this article argues that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, and that helping those in need should be done effectively where they are. The moral high ground, according to the writer, lies in not encouraging migration but in providing aid and support to improve their conditions in their home countries. Critics of refugee resettlement and immigration are often accused of conflating the two issues, but the author justifies the connection, highlighting the strain on social services and the potential loss of talented individuals from countries of origin. The article also questions the morality of those lecturing on immigration when their own policies could lead to overpopulation and strain on resources. The true moral course, it is argued, is to help those in need where they are, rather than encouraging mass migration.
END OF SUMMARY.
