SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer and columnists, have labeled the decision as "inhumane", "shameful", and "morally wrong". The author argues that the criticism is hypocritical, as the left often prioritizes immigration over the welfare of those already in the country, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless. The author also argues that mass migration can have negative consequences, including draining origin countries of their best people and putting a strain on destination countries' social services and infrastructure. The author concludes that the true moral course of action is to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries, rather than encouraging migration.
