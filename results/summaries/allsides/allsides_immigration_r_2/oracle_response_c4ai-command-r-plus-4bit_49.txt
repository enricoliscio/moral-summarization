SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declined to accept refugee resettlement, citing the disproportionate impact on his state due to the federal government's broken immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from those who view it as inhumane and violating American values. Critics have accused Abbott of being morally wrong, xenophobic, and shameful. However, the author of this article argues that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, and that helping those in need right where they are is the true moral course of action. The strain on social services, infrastructure, and social fabric in destination countries, as well as the loss of significant slices of their best people in origin countries, are among the issues raised. The article also questions the motives of those who encourage migration without considering its potential impact on their own countries' poor and downtrodden populations. The Washington Examiner's Brad Polumbo is criticized for downplaying the potential impact of refugee resettlement and immigration overhaul on the United States. The author warns that a tipping point will eventually be reached if establishment conservatives and leftist Democrats get their wish, and America will cease to be America as we know it.
END OF SUMMARY.
