SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has made his state the first to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics have slammed the decision as "inhumane", "shameful", and "morally wrong", accusing Abbott of xenophobia and fear. However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration has negative impacts on both destination and origin countries, and that it is morally wrong to prioritize foreigners over citizens. The article concludes that the US should focus on helping people in their own countries rather than encouraging migration. END OF SUMMARY.
