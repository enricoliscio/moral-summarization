Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a detailed article with a lot of opinions and moral language. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry strong moral connotations. Words like "inhumane," "morally wrong," "xenophobia," etc. 

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and follow the structure they specified. I'll start by outlining the main points: Texas Governor Abbott's decision, the reactions from critics, the arguments about refugees and immigration, and the counterarguments about the impact on both host and origin countries.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the moral debate without getting bogged down in too many details. I'll focus on the key arguments from both sides, using the identified moral words to maintain the original framing. I'll also make sure to mention the points about the impact on social services, the loss of skilled workers from origin countries, and the concern about the moral high ground.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Abbott's decision, the criticism, the counterarguments about the moral implications, and the broader debate on immigration policies. I'll keep it concise and within the word limit, ensuring that the moral language is preserved to reflect the author's original stance.

**SUMMARY:**  
Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the state’s resources and the federal government’s "broken" immigration system. His decision sparked outrage from critics, who accused him of being "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "prompted by xenophobia and fear." Critics argue that refugees and immigrants enrich Texas, and Abbott’s decision tarnishes the state’s "national character." Proponents of mass migration argue that it improves lives, but opponents counter that it strains social services, harms origin countries by losing skilled workers, and risks overpopulation in destination countries. They advocate for helping people where they are, rather than encouraging migration. The debate highlights conflicting views on morality, with critics accusing opponents of conflating refugees and immigrants, while supporters insist on upholding "American values." The issue remains contentious, with no clear resolution in sight.
