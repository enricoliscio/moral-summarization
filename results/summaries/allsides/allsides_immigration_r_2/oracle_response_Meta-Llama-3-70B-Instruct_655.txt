SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement has sparked outrage, with critics calling it "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "shameful." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration creates a vacuum that draws millions, leading to a dangerous journey where many die, and ultimately makes the world a worse place. Proponents of mass immigration are accused of causing the planet to become worse, as destination countries are negatively impacted and origin countries lose their best people. The author questions why liberal mayors are so keen on bringing in more refugees when their own cities are filled with homeless people, and argues that the focus should be on helping those in need in their own countries, rather than encouraging migration.
