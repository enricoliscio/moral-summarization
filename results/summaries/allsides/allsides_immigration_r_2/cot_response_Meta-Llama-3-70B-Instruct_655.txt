SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has made his state the first to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics have labeled this decision as "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong," accusing Abbott of being prompted by "xenophobia" and "fear." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help refugees and their countries of origin. The author claims that proponents of mass immigration have caused the entire planet to become worse, negatively impacting both destination countries and countries of origin. The author concludes that the moral high ground belongs to immigration hawks, not proponents of mass migration. END OF SUMMARY.
