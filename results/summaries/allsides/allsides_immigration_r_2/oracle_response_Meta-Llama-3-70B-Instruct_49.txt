SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement has sparked outrage from critics who accuse him of being "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration creates a vacuum that draws millions, leading to a dangerous journey where many die, and ultimately makes the world a worse place. Proponents of mass immigration are accused of causing origin countries to lose their best people, leading to declining prospects for those left behind. The author questions why liberal mayors are more focused on bringing in refugees than addressing the homeless population in their own cities. The article concludes that the moral high ground belongs to immigration hawks, who prioritize the well-being of their own citizens and the integrity of their nation.
