Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally framed words. The user mentioned that I should list each word starting with an asterisk. 

Looking at the article, the author uses words like "inhumane," "violates," "shameful," "morally wrong," "xenophobia," "fear," "tarnished," "fundamental," "national character," "absurd," "laughable," "morally high ground," "betraying," "RINO squishes," "prioritize," "betray," "left twisting," "pathologies," "ignored," "values," "betray," "RINO squishes," "tarnished," "fundamental," "national character," "absurd," "laughable," "morally high ground," "betraying," "RINO squishes," "prioritize," "betray," "left twisting," "pathologies," "ignored," "values," "betray."

Wait, maybe I should be more precise. The author uses terms like "inhumane," "violates," "shameful," "morally wrong," "xenophobia," "fear," "tarnished," "fundamental," "national character," "absurd," "laughable," "morally high ground," "betraying," "RINO squishes," "prioritize," "betray," "left twisting," "pathologies," "ignored," "values," "betray." I think that's a good list.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing intact. The article starts with Texas Governor Abbott refusing to accept refugees, which sparks criticism from 'woke police.' The author argues against mass migration, citing negative impacts on both destination and origin countries. They also criticize the moral stance of those who support immigration, comparing it to Hitler's lectures on kindness, which is a strong moral statement. The author suggests that helping people in their home countries is a better moral approach than migration. They also mention the political implications, like the potential change in voter demographics. 

I should make sure to include words like "inhumane," "morally wrong," "xenophobia," "tarnished," "fundamental," "national character," "absurd," "laughable," "morally high ground," "betraying," "RINO squishes," "prioritize," "betray," "left twisting," "pathologies," "ignored," "values," "betray."

So, the summary should capture the conflict between Abbott's decision and the criticism, the author's argument against mass migration, the moral implications, and the political angle. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

I think I have a good grasp now. Time to put it all together.

This decision sparked criticism from 'woke police,' with accusations of being "inhumane," "morally wrong," and driven by "xenophobia." Critics argued it tarnished Texas's "national character."

They suggest helping people in their home countries is morally superior to mass migration. The article also questions the political implications, fearing a shift in voter demographics. The debate over refugees and immigration highlights clashing moral perspectives, with accusations of betraying constituents and prioritizing foreigners over citizens.
