SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement has sparked outrage from the "woke police," who accuse him of being "inhumane" and "morally wrong." Critics claim Abbott's decision "violates American values" and is "prompted by xenophobia and fear." However, the author argues that the true moral high ground lies with immigration hawks, who recognize the negative impact of mass migration on both destination and origin countries. By creating a system that encourages the strong and wealthy to leave their home countries, proponents of mass immigration have made the planet worse. The author questions why liberal mayors are so eager to bring in more refugees when their own cities are plagued by homelessness. The true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author warns that if establishment conservatives and leftist Democrats get their wish, a tipping point will be reached, and America will "cease to be America."
