Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding to decline refugee resettlement. He cites the disproportionate impact on Texas due to the federal government's immigration system and the need to help those already in the state. This decision has sparked a lot of criticism from various groups and individuals, including political figures and media outlets, who are calling it inhumane, shameful, and morally wrong. They argue that it's driven by xenophobia and fear.

Then, the article delves into a broader debate about immigration policies. It contrasts the views of immigration hawks with those who support mass migration. The author argues that both refugee resettlement and immigration, whether legal or illegal, bring in people who are often poor, unskilled, and from cultures that don't easily assimilate. The author suggests that encouraging mass migration harms both destination and origin countries, leading to overpopulation and strain on resources, while also causing the origin countries to lose their skilled individuals.

The article also questions the moral high ground of those who criticize Abbott, suggesting that the left's approach to immigration is flawed. It points out the hypocrisy of liberal mayors focusing on bringing in refugees while neglecting their own city's homeless populations. The author advocates for helping people in their home countries rather than encouraging migration.

Additionally, the article discusses the political implications, mentioning that establishment conservatives and Democrats aim for more immigration, which could shift the voter base towards socialist-leaning individuals, changing the country's identity.

So, the key points are:

1. Texas Governor Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement.
2. Criticism from various groups for being inhumane and driven by fear.
3. The debate over immigration policies, with arguments against mass migration due to its impact on both countries and the moral implications.
4. The suggestion that helping people in their home countries is better than encouraging migration.
5. Political concerns about changing demographics and the country's identity.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include these main points clearly and concisely.
