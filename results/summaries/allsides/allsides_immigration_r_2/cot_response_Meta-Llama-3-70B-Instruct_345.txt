SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sparked outrage by becoming the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer, have labeled the decision as "inhumane" and "morally wrong," accusing Abbott of "xenophobia" and "fear." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author suggests that proponents of mass immigration are causing the entire planet to become worse, negatively impacting both destination and origin countries. The article concludes that the moral high ground lies with immigration hawks, who prioritize the well-being of their own citizens over the desires of migrants. END OF SUMMARY.
