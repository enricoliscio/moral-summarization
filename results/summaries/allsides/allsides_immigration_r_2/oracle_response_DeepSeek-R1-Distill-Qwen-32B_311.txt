Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they want a summary that includes as many of the author's morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement, which has sparked moral debates. The author criticizes the woke movement and argues against mass migration, suggesting it's harmful to both destination and origin countries. They also question the morality of prioritizing refugees over the homeless in their own cities.

I need to identify the key morally framed words from the author's list and incorporate them into the summary. Words like "decline," "inhumane," "wrong," "xenophobia," "welcome," "war," "persecution," "migration," "strain," "encourage," "betraying," etc., should be included.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Abbott's decision, the reactions from critics, the author's counterarguments about migration's impact, and the debate over who has the moral high ground. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral tone.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally while including the necessary moral terms. I'll check to make sure all key points are covered and that the summary accurately reflects the author's perspective.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on his state due to the federal government's "broken" immigration system. His decision was met with moral outrage, branded as "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "shameful" by critics, who accused him of xenophobia and fear. The author argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are often conflated, both representing the movement of impoverished, often unskilled individuals from cultures that may not easily assimilate. The author questions the morality of mass migration, suggesting it strains destination countries and harms origin countries by depleting them of their best people. They argue that true morality lies in helping people where they are, rather than encouraging migration. Critics, including establishment conservatives and Democrats, are accused of prioritizing refugees over the homeless in their own cities, with the author warning of a potential "invasion" that could "cease to be America." The debate over refugees and immigration is framed as a clash between those who prioritize "welcoming" and those who focus on "strain" and "pathologies." END OF SUMMARY.
