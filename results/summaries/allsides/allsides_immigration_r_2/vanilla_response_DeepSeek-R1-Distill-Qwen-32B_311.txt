Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article starts by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding not to accept refugees, which is the first time a GOP governor has done that. The author mentions that this decision has caused a lot of backlash from people on the left, calling it inhumane and against American values. They also reference the mayors of Texas cities wanting to continue accepting refugees but being blocked by Abbott.

Next, the author argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are essentially the same thing, both involving people from other countries who might not easily assimilate. They criticize the left for being hypocritical about morality, comparing them to Hitler, which is a strong statement. The author then questions whether opening borders to mass migration is truly a good thing, pointing out that it can strain resources in destination countries and deplete origin countries of their skilled workers.

They also bring up the issue of homelessness in Austin, questioning why the mayor wants more refugees when there are already many homeless people. The author suggests that instead of encouraging migration, we should help people where they are. They criticize those who support mass immigration for not having clear limits and for possibly leading to a change in the country's demographics towards socialist-leaning voters.

The article also mentions a counterargument from a conservative writer who downplays the number of refugees as not being a massive wave. The author counters that while 20,000 isn't a lot, if more are allowed in, it could tip the balance.

So, to summarize, the key points are: Texas Governor Abbott's refusal to accept refugees, the backlash from the left, the argument that immigration and refugee resettlement are similar, the critique of the impact on both origin and destination countries, the moral debate, and the potential demographic shift.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the main arguments and reactions without getting too bogged down in the details. I should make sure to include the opposing views and the author's stance on the issue.
