SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state and the need to prioritize resources for existing refugees, migrants, and the homeless. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer and columnists, have labeled the decision as "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "shameful." However, the author argues that mass migration and refugee resettlement can have negative consequences, including straining social services and infrastructure, and causing origin countries to lose their best people. The author suggests that the true moral course of action is to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries, rather than encouraging migration. The article questions the moral high ground of immigration proponents, arguing that their policies can lead to a decline in the quality of life in destination countries and a worsening of the planet as a whole.
