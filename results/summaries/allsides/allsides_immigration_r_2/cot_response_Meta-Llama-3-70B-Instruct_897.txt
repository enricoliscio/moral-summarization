SUMMARY:
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has made his state the first to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has triggered the wrath of critics, who label it as "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." They argue that it "violates American values" and "tarnishes" the state's "national character." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author claims that mass migration can lead to a vacuum that draws millions of people, causing harm to both destination and origin countries. The author concludes that the "shameful" decision to prevent refugee resettlement is actually a moral imperative to prioritize the needs of those already in the country. END OF SUMMARY.
