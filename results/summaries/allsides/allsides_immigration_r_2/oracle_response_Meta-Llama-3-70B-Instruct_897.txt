SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sparked outrage by becoming the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics have labeled the decision as "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "shameful," accusing Abbott of "xenophobia" and "fear." However, the author argues that the true moral high ground lies with immigration hawks, as mass migration can create a vacuum that draws millions of impoverished people, leading to a worse world. The author questions whether encouraging migration is truly moral, as it can negatively impact both destination and origin countries. Instead, the author suggests that the moral course of action is to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author also criticizes proponents of mass immigration for downplaying the numbers and failing to provide a clear answer to when enough will be enough.
