Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Texas Governor Greg Abbott refusing to accept refugees, which sparked a debate. The author argues against mass migration, saying it harms both destination and origin countries. They also criticize the moral arguments used by immigration supporters. I should highlight the key points: Abbott's decision, the criticism from woke groups, the author's counterarguments about the negative impacts of migration, and the moral debate. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments and the moral framing without getting into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the state's resources and the federal government's immigration system. This decision drew sharp criticism from 'woke' groups, who accused Abbott of inhumane actions and moral wrongness. The author argues that mass migration, including refugees and immigrants, harms both destination and origin countries, as it drains skilled workers from poorer nations and strains resources in wealthier ones. They criticize the moral framing of immigration proponents, suggesting that helping people in their home countries is a better approach. The debate over refugee resettlement and immigration continues, with critics accusing the GOP of prioritizing foreign over domestic needs. The author questions the moral high ground of immigration supporters and warns of the long-term consequences of unchecked migration on national identity and social fabric. END OF SUMMARY.
