SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has refused to accept refugee resettlement in his state, citing the impact of the federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from some who view it as inhumane and a violation of American values. However, the article's author argues that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries, and that helping those in need right where they are is the true moral course of action. They criticize proponents of mass immigration for creating a system that encourages the migration of a country's "best people," leaving those truly stuck behind with declining prospects for improvement. The author also questions the morality of those who support mass migration, arguing that it will eventually lead to a tipping point where socialist-leaning voters outnumber freedom-loving ones, fundamentally changing America. 

END OF SUMMARY.
