Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article starts by mentioning that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the state's resources and the federal government's broken immigration system. This decision has sparked criticism from various groups and individuals, including Tom Steyer, The Washington Post, and immigration advocates. They argue that this decision is inhumane and against American values, with some accusing it of being driven by xenophobia.

The author then discusses the broader debate on immigration, comparing it to refugee resettlement. They argue that both involve people from other cultures who might not easily assimilate, and that mass migration could negatively impact both destination and origin countries. The author questions the morality of encouraging migration versus helping people in their home countries. They also criticize the lack of clear limits on immigration from proponents and warn of potential cultural and demographic shifts in the U.S.

The article also touches on the political divide, with some GOP governors supporting refugee resettlement, leading to accusations of prioritizing foreigners over constituents. The author contrasts this with the idea that helping people where they are might be a more moral approach.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Abbott's decision, the criticism it received, the author's stance on immigration vs. helping in place, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the main arguments from both sides and the broader implications discussed.
