Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible and that the summary should be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement, which has sparked moral debates. The author argues against mass migration, citing its negative impacts on both origin and destination countries, and criticizes those who support immigration as ignoring their own country's needs.

I need to identify the key morally framed words from the author's list that are used in the text. Words like "decline," "inhumane," "violates," "xenophobia," "wrong," "welcoming," "war," "persecution," "strain," "betraying," and "ceases" are central to the moral arguments presented.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring that the moral perspectives are clearly conveyed. I'll start by mentioning Abbott's decision and the criticism it received, then move on to the author's arguments against mass migration and the impact on both countries. I'll conclude with the concern about the future of America's identity.

I must keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the main arguments without delving into too many details. I'll make sure to include the moral implications highlighted by the author, such as the violation of American values and the potential strain on social services.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral framing words to maintain the author's perspective. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the provided content while preserving the moral stance.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on his state due to the federal government's "broken" immigration system. His decision was met with harsh criticism, branded as "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "prompted by xenophobia." Critics accused Abbott of violating American values and tarnishing the state's reputation for welcoming those fleeing war and persecution. The author argues that mass migration, including refugee resettlement, negatively impacts both origin and destination countries, as it strains social services and depletes origin countries of their best people. They question the morality of prioritizing refugees over the poor and homeless in one's own country, suggesting that helping people where they are is a more ethical approach. The author also warns of the long-term consequences of unchecked immigration, fearing it could lead to a "tipping point" where America "ceases to be America." The debate over resettlement and migration is framed as a clash between those who prioritize "welcoming" refugees and those who see it as a threat to national identity and values. END OF SUMMARY.
