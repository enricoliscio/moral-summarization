SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has decided to opt-out of refugee resettlement, citing the strain on the state due to the federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from some who view it as inhumane and contrary to American values. However, others argue that mass migration can have negative consequences for both destination and origin countries. They argue that it strains social services and infrastructure and leads to a "brain drain" in the countries migrants leave behind. The article also questions the moral high ground of those who support mass migration, suggesting that helping people in their home countries is a more ethical approach. It warns that a tipping point will be reached if refugee resettlement and immigration are not carefully managed, leading to a loss of America's unique character.
END OF SUMMARY.
