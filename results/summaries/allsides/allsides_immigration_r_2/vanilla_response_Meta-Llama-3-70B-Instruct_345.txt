SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has sparked outrage from critics, who accuse Abbott of being "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the author argues that the critics are hypocrites, as they are more concerned with imposing their own moral values on society than with the actual welfare of refugees. The author also argues that mass migration can have negative consequences, including straining social services and infrastructure in destination countries, and depriving origin countries of their best people. Instead, the author suggests that the true moral course of action is to find effective ways to help refugees and their countries in their current locations.
