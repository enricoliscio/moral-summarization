Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the arguments made.

The article starts by discussing Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement, which has sparked criticism from various groups and individuals. The author mentions that this decision was called "inhumane" and "morally wrong" by critics, including Tom Steyer, The Washington Post, and others. The author seems to support Abbott's decision and argues against the critics, suggesting that their moral stance is hypocritical or based on flawed reasoning.

The author then goes on to argue that refugee resettlement and immigration are essentially the same, both bringing in people who are often unskilled and hard to assimilate. They claim that allowing mass migration harms both the destination and origin countries, leading to a decline in quality of life and overburdening social services. The author also questions the morality of prioritizing refugees over the homeless in the same city, like Austin.

Furthermore, the author criticizes the left for their supposed hypocrisy on moral grounds and questions the practicality and morality of mass immigration. They suggest that the real moral action is to help people in their own countries rather than encouraging migration. The article also touches on political implications, warning that increased immigration could lead to a shift in the political landscape towards socialism.

I need to capture all these points in a concise summary, making sure to highlight the author's moral arguments against refugee resettlement and immigration, the criticism from opponents, and the broader implications discussed. I should keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it reflects the author's perspective accurately.
