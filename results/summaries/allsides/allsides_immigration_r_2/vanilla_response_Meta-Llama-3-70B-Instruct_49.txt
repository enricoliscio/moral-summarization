SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has become the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer, have labeled the decision as "inhumane" and "morally wrong." However, the article argues that proponents of mass migration are causing harm to both destination and origin countries, leading to a decline in the quality of life for those left behind. The author suggests that instead of encouraging migration, it is morally right to find effective ways to help people in need in their own countries. The article also criticizes those who downplay the numbers of refugees and immigrants, arguing that a tipping point will eventually be reached, leading to a loss of freedom and identity in countries like the US.

END OF SUMMARY.
