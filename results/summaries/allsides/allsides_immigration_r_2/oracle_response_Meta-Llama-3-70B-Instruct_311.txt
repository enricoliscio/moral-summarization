SUMMARY:

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sparked outrage by becoming the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing the "disproportionate" impact on the border state due to the Federal government's "broken" immigration system. Critics have labeled the decision as "inhumane," "morally wrong," and "prompted by xenophobia and fear." However, the author argues that the true moral course of action is not to encourage migration, but to find effective ways to help those in need in their own countries. The author contends that mass migration creates a vacuum that draws millions, leading to a dangerous journey where many die, and ultimately makes the world a worse place. The author also questions the morality of prioritizing refugees over the homeless and downtrodden populations in one's own country. The article concludes that the true moral high ground lies with those who oppose immigration, as they seek to address the root causes of migration rather than encouraging it.

END OF SUMMARY.
