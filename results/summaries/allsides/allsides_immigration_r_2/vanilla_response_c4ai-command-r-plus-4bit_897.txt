SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has refused to accept refugee resettlement in his state, citing the impact of the federal government's "broken" immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from some who view it as inhumane and contrary to American values. Critics argue that refugee resettlement and immigration are two separate issues, but the author of the article conflates them, arguing that both involve the presence of impoverished and unskilled people from cultures that may not assimilate easily. The author questions the morality of mass migration, suggesting that it creates a vacuum that draws people from their home countries, potentially impacting those left behind negatively. They argue that mass migration can strain destination countries' social services and infrastructure and deplete origin countries of their best people. The article concludes that encouraging migration is not the moral course of action but finding ways to help people in their home countries is. The debate between immigration hawks and proponents of mass migration is discussed, with critics accusing the former of conflating refugee resettlement and immigration.
END OF SUMMARY.
