Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott deciding to decline refugee resettlement. The author mentions that this decision was met with criticism from what they refer to as "woke police," including people like Tom Steyer and organizations like RAICES Texas. They use strong language, calling Abbott's decision "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong." The author seems to be critical of these critics, suggesting that they're imposing their own twisted definition of virtue.

Then, the author argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are essentially the same in terms of their impact, both bringing in people who are often poor, unskilled, and from cultures that don't easily assimilate. They take issue with the idea that helping refugees by bringing them here is the moral high ground. Instead, they suggest that this approach might actually harm both the destination and origin countries by draining the latter of their capable people and overburdening the former.

The author also brings up the point about the homeless in Austin, questioning why the mayor would focus on bringing in more refugees when there's already a homelessness issue. They argue that the real moral action is to help people where they are, rather than encouraging migration.

They also discuss how immigration proponents often don't set a limit on how many immigrants or refugees they want to accept, which could lead to a tipping point where the country's character changes. The author references a Washington Examiner article that supports accepting refugees, but they counter by saying that even small numbers could lead to bigger changes over time.

So, the main points are: Abbott's decision to decline refugees, criticism from progressives, the argument that resettlement and immigration are linked, the negative impacts on both countries, the focus on helping people in their own countries, and the potential long-term demographic changes.

Now, I need to summarize this while keeping the moral framing. The author is against resettlement, arguing that it's not the most moral approach and that it has negative consequences. They're critical of critics who they see as hypocritical or not considering the bigger picture.

I should make sure the summary reflects that the author believes the moral high ground is not with the critics but with those who oppose resettlement, arguing that it's better to help people where they are rather than encourage migration that could harm both countries.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start by mentioning Abbott's decision, the criticism, the author's argument that resettlement and immigration are linked, the negative impacts, and the call to help people in their home countries instead.

Let me try to structure that into a coherent summary, making sure to include the moral arguments from the author's perspective without adding my own opinion.

The article discusses Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to decline refugee resettlement, sparking criticism from progressives who labeled his choice as "inhumane" and "morally wrong." The author counters that resettlement and immigration are interconnected, both bringing in individuals who may struggle to assimilate. They argue that aiding refugees by relocating them is not the most ethical approach, as it can harm both the destination countries by overburdening resources and the origin countries by losing skilled individuals. The author questions the focus on resettlement when domestic issues, like homelessness, persist. They advocate for helping people in their home countries to foster improvement there, rather than encouraging migration. The author also critiques the lack of limits on immigration, fearing long-term demographic shifts that could alter the nation's character. Thus, the moral stance is to address issues locally rather than through resettlement, preserving national integrity and aiding others effectively where they are.
