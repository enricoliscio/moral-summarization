Alright, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. 

The article begins by talking about Texas Governor Greg Abbott declining to accept refugees, which is the first time a GOP governor has done so. He cites the impact on the border state and the responsibility to help those already there. This decision caused a lot of backlash, with critics calling it inhumane and violating American values. The author then argues against the critics, conflating refugee resettlement with immigration, both legal and illegal. He suggests that both represent the movement of people who are often unskilled and not easily assimilable. 

The author criticizes the "woke police" for imposing their definition of virtue, comparing them to Iran's morality police. He questions the moral high ground of immigration hawks versus proponents, arguing that mass migration harms both destination and origin countries. He mentions the strain on social services and the loss of skilled people from origin countries. 

He also brings up the point about helping people where they are instead of encouraging migration. The author questions why some mayors, like Austin's, focus on bringing in refugees while their cities have homeless populations. He warns about the potential for a tipping point where socialist-leaning voters outnumber freedom-loving ones, leading America to "cease to be America."

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like decline, resettlement, decision, impose, inhumane, violate, prevented, wrong, xenophobia, close, safety, opting, welcoming, war, persecution, migration, die, twisting, action, encouraged, worse, strain, stuck, pathologies, bringing, encourage, find, take, betraying, fleeing, limited, invasion, establishment, overhaul, ceases.

I should structure the summary to highlight Abbott's decision, the backlash, the author's argument against mass migration, and the moral implications. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me try to outline the key points:

1. Texas Governor Greg Abbott declines refugee resettlement, citing border state impact and responsibility to current residents.
2. Critics call the decision inhumane, violating American values, and driven by xenophobia.
3. Author argues that refugee resettlement and immigration are conflated, both representing similar challenges.
4. Mass migration strains destination countries and harms origin countries by losing skilled workers.
5. Questioning the focus on refugees while domestic issues like homelessness persist.
6. Warning about a tipping point leading to a loss of American identity.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and includes the moral terms.
