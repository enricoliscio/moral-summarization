SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declined to accept refugee resettlement, citing the disproportionate impact on his state due to the federal government's broken immigration system. This decision has triggered criticism from those who view it as inhumane and a violation of American values. Critics have accused the governor of being prompted by xenophobia and fear. However, the author of this article argues that the true moral course of action is to help those in need right where they are, rather than encouraging migration. They argue that mass immigration causes a vacuum that draws people from their countries of origin, often resulting in dangerous journeys and negatively impacting the social services and infrastructure of the destination countries. The article also raises concerns about the potential strain on social services and infrastructure in destination countries, as well as the loss of talented individuals from the countries of origin. The author believes that encouraging migration is not the solution and that helping people and their countries right where they are is the true moral course of action. This view is contrasted with that of establishment conservatives and leftist Democrats, who support refugee resettlement and immigration overhaul, which the author believes will eventually lead to a tipping point where America ceases to be America.
END OF SUMMARY.
