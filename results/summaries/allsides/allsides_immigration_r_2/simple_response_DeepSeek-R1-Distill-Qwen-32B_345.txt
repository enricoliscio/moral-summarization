Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the author's perspective accurately.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article starts with Texas Governor Greg Abbott refusing to accept refugees, which sparked criticism from various groups and individuals. The author then argues against mass migration, suggesting it's harmful to both origin and destination countries. They also critique the moral stance of immigration proponents, comparing them to the "woke police."

I need to make sure the summary captures the author's argument against mass migration and their critique of the moral arguments from the other side. It's important to include the points about the impact on both countries, the moral high ground debate, and the potential consequences of mass migration.

I should structure the summary to first mention Abbott's decision and the criticism it received. Then, transition into the author's counterarguments about the negative impacts of migration. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral framing as presented in the article.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include key points like the impact on social services, the loss of skilled workers from origin countries, and the comparison to the "woke police." I'll also highlight the author's suggestion that helping people in their own countries is a better moral approach.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and accurately represents the author's moral perspective without adding my own opinions.

SUMMARY: Texas Governor Greg Abbott became the first GOP governor to decline refugee resettlement, citing resource allocation and border state concerns. His decision drew sharp criticism from immigration advocates, who accused him of xenophobia and a violation of American values. Critics argue that refugees and immigrants contribute positively to society, and opposing resettlement reflects a broader opposition to immigration. The author counters by conflating refugee resettlement with mass migration, arguing that both strain resources and harm origin countries by exporting skilled workers. They suggest that instead of encouraging migration, the moral duty is to help people in their home countries. The debate over immigration and refugees highlights conflicting moral perspectives, with critics accusing opponents of xenophobia while proponents face accusations of ignoring domestic needs. The author warns of potential long-term consequences of mass migration, including overpopulation and cultural shifts, questioning whether the moral high ground lies with immigration hawks or proponents. END OF SUMMARY.
