SUMMARY:
The decision by Texas Governor Greg Abbott to refuse refugee resettlement in his state has triggered strong moral condemnation from various quarters. Critics, including presidential candidate Tom Steyer, journalists, and immigration advocates, have labeled the move as "inhumane," "shameful," and "morally wrong," accusing Abbott of being prompted by "xenophobia and fear." They argue that Abbott's decision tarnishes Texas's reputation and goes against the "national character" of welcoming those seeking refuge. The article counters these moral criticisms by conflating refugee resettlement with immigration, arguing that both involve the arrival of impoverished and unskilled individuals from cultures that may not assimilate easily. It questions the morality of mass migration, suggesting that it creates a vacuum that encourages the strongest and wealthiest to leave their countries of origin, ultimately harming those left behind. The piece concludes by challenging the notion of encouraging migration as a moral imperative, instead suggesting that finding effective ways to help people in their home countries is the true moral course of action. However, critics like Brad Polumbo defend refugee resettlement as "doing the right thing to help people fleeing tyrants and terrorists." The article warns that combining refugee resettlement with overhauls to the immigration system could lead to a tipping point where "socialist-leaning voters" outnumber "freedom-loving" ones, ultimately changing the fabric of America.
