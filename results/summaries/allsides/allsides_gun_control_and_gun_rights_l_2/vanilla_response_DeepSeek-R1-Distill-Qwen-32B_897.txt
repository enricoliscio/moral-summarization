Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article talks about Democrats in the House planning to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. They're doing this as a priority in the new Congress. The key figures mentioned are Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who are leading the push after the Sandy Hook tragedy. They're organizing an event with other Democrats and advocacy groups to call for change.

The event is happening after a national vigil for gun violence victims, including those from Parkland, Las Vegas, and other mass shootings. The issue has been stagnant in Washington, with little progress despite Trump's promises after Parkland. There's also a mention of a lawsuit by Lenny Pozner against conspiracy theorists denying Sandy Hook's reality.

Federal background checks are currently limited and not well enforced. Bipartisan efforts failed under Republican control, but now with the Democratic majority in the House, they're pushing a new strategy, hoping to gain Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. Congressman Mike Thompson is expected to introduce a bill, and Peter King might support it despite past failures.

So, the main points are: Democrats introducing background check legislation, event with survivors and advocates, stalled progress in Washington, Pozner's lawsuit, limited enforcement of current laws, and the new strategy with hopes for bipartisan support.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.
