SUMMARY:

In a bold move, Democrats in the House of Representatives are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a crucial step towards addressing the devastating gun violence that has plagued America. The push comes after years of inaction from the White House and Congress, despite heartbreaking tragedies like the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the charge, joined by House Democrats, survivors, and advocacy groups. The event will follow a national vigil for gun violence victims and will feature family members of those affected by mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, and other cities. The moral imperative is clear: it's time for action to curb gun violence and protect American lives. The Democrats' new strategy aims to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 presidential election. END OF SUMMARY.
