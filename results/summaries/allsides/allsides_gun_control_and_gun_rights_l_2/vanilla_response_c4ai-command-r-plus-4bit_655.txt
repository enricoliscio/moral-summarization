SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are pushing for stronger gun control measures in the wake of recent mass shootings in the United States. The Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of its first priorities in the 2019 Congress. The event will be attended by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and bereaved family members of victims from various mass shootings across the country. Despite previous pledges from President Trump to curb gun violence, there has been little progress on the issue from the White House or Congress. Democrats are feeling emboldened to pursue a more aggressive strategy on gun control, with some hoping to win over Republican support and set the agenda for the 2020 presidential election. This push for gun reform is supported by advocacy groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords, started by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords.
