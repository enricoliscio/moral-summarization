SUMMARY: In the wake of recent mass shootings in the United States, prominent Democrats are calling for stronger gun control measures and plan to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut where the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred, are leading the push for action, joined by House Democrats and anti-gun violence advocacy groups. The issue of gun violence has stalled in Washington despite promises from President Trump to take definitive action. Democrats are feeling emboldened to pursue a more aggressive strategy on gun control, hoping to gain more Republican support and make it a key issue in the 2020 presidential election. Family members of victims from mass shootings in Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, Aurora, Colorado, Charleston, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas, are also calling for change. Federal law on background checks is limited and poorly enforced, and even bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have failed in the Republican-controlled Congress. The article highlights the personal story of Lenny Pozner, a father of one of the young victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, who has faced persistent harassment from conspiracy theorists and is suing those who claim the massacre was a hoax. The Democrats' strategy faces challenges with the GOP still controlling the Senate, but they remain determined to make gun reform a top priority.
