SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. This comes as part of a new push for stronger gun control in the wake of recent mass shootings. The legislation is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives, where Democrats now hold a majority. The move is part of a broader effort to make progress on an issue that has bitterly divided America. Advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and family members of victims will join the lawmakers on Capitol Hill to call for change. Despite past pledges from President Trump, there has been little progress on gun control in Washington. Democrats hope to win Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

END OF SUMMARY.
