SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats are demanding stronger gun control measures as they begin a new push to curb gun violence in America. The call for action comes as the Democratic majority in the House prepares to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut where the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting occurred, will lead the demands. They will be joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, and survivors and bereaved family members of mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, Aurora, Charleston, and Houston. The issue of gun control has been stalled in Washington, with negligible progress and broken pledges from the White House and Congress. Victims' families have angrily demanded gun control measures, and one parent of a Sandy Hook victim has been victimized by conspiracy theorists, forcing him to move multiple times. Democrats are emboldened to set out a strident new strategy, winning Republican support and setting their agenda for 2020. Their demands include tightening background checks and strengthening gun reform legislation.
