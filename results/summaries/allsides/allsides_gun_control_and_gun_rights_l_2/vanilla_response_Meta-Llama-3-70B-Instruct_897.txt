SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a top priority for the incoming Congress. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the call for stronger gun control alongside House Democrats and anti-gun violence advocacy groups. The push comes after years of stalled progress on the issue, despite pledges from President Trump to take action after the Parkland school shooting. Federal law requiring background checks is limited and often not well enforced, and bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have failed to pass in the Republican-controlled Congress. However, Democrats are feeling emboldened to take a stronger stance on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set out their platform ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

END OF SUMMARY.
