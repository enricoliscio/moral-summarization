SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are leading a fresh push for stronger gun control in the US. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a bitter issue that divides America. The move comes after a series of mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy, which left 20 children and six school staff dead. Family members of victims from recent mass shootings will join the call to action on Capitol Hill, angrily demanding gun control. Despite previous pledges from Donald Trump, there has been negligible progress on the issue. The Democrats' strident new strategy aims to win more Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election. END OF SUMMARY.
