Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Democrats in the U.S. Congress planning new gun control measures, especially after the midterm elections. They're focusing on background checks for all gun sales. The House Democrats, now in majority, are introducing legislation. They're working with advocacy groups and survivors.

I should mention the key players: Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who are leading the push. They're meeting with House Democrats and groups like the Brady Campaign. The event is happening after a vigil for gun violence victims. They're highlighting past mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, etc.

The article also touches on the challenges: the Senate is still Republican, so bills might be blocked. But Democrats are hopeful for 2020. There's a lawsuit from a Sandy Hook parent against conspiracy theorists, showing the emotional impact. Bipartisan efforts have failed before, but some Republicans might support new bills.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main points: Democrats' new strategy, focus on background checks, key figures, the vigil, challenges, and the broader context like the lawsuit and bipartisan possibilities.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the Democratic push, mention the legislation, key senators, the event, the vigil, recent shootings, the lawsuit, enforcement issues, Senate blockage, and their hopes for 2020. Also, note bipartisan support possibilities.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all critical aspects without going over the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft.
