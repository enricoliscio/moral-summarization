SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats plan to ramp up calls for stronger gun control at the start of a new push to use their strengthened voice in Washington to make progress on an issue that bitterly divides America. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, where 20 children and six staff were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary, will lead demands for fresh action. The Democratic majority in the House is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of its first priorities in 2019, in an aggressive new strategy. This push for gun control is supported by advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, calling for change and demanding an end to gun violence. 

Family members of victims from mass shootings across the country, including Parkland, Las Vegas, Aurora, Charleston, and Houston, have joined together to demand action. The issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress despite pledges from President Trump to curb gun violence. Democrats are now emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy, hoping to win more Republican support and make gun reform a priority in the incoming Congress. 

SUMMARY: END OF SUMMARY.
