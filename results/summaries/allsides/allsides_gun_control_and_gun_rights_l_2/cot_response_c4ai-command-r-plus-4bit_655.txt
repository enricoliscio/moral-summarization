SUMMARY: 
Prominent Democrats are demanding fresh gun control legislation, with an aggressive new strategy that includes sweeping background check bills and advocacy from survivors and the bereaved of gun violence. The issue has been stalled in Washington, despite pledges from Donald Trump for definitive action to curb gun violence. In the wake of mass shootings in Thousand Oaks, California, and Parkland, Florida, anger and demands for gun control have grown louder. 

The Democratic majority in the House is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of its first priorities for 2019. This push for gun reform is emboldened by a strident new strategy, demanding Republican support and setting the stage for the 2020 presidential election. Bipartisan efforts to strengthen background checks have previously failed to gain traction in Congress, with federal law limited and poorly enforced. 

The event on Capitol Hill will include senators from Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred, as well as advocacy groups and family members of victims from recent mass shootings across the country. The Democrats' strategy aims to highlight their strengthened voice in Washington and address an issue that bitterly divides America.
