SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers in the US House of Representatives are expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a key priority for the new Congress. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the push for stronger gun control, joined by House Democrats and anti-gun violence advocacy groups. The effort comes after years of inaction on the issue, despite mass shootings and pledges from President Donald Trump to take action. The proposed legislation aims to strengthen federal law requiring background checks, which is currently limited and poorly enforced. While the GOP-controlled Senate may block the bill, Democrats hope to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 presidential election. A number of advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign and Giffords, will join the call to action on Capitol Hill.

END OF SUMMARY.
