SUMMARY: In the wake of recent gun violence and mass shootings across America, prominent Democrats are pushing for stronger gun control measures. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut where the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting occurred, are leading the calls for action. They are joined by House Democrats, advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and bereaved family members from various mass shootings. The Democratic majority in the House is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as a priority in the incoming Congress. This push for progress on gun control comes despite negligible action from the White House or Congress, and the continued division in America on this issue. The article also highlights the ongoing harassment and threats faced by Lenny Pozner, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, at the hands of conspiracy theorists claiming the massacre was a hoax. Federal law on background checks is limited and poorly enforced, and bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have languished in Congress. Democrats are laying out a strident new strategy, hoping to gain more Republican support and make gun reform a key issue in the 2020 presidential election.
