SUMMARY: 
Prominent Democrats are planning to ramp up calls for stronger gun control and to make it a priority in the new Congress. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut where the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting occurred, will lead demands for fresh action. They will be joined by House Democrats, advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, calling for change and a national vigil for victims of gun violence. 

There have been numerous mass shootings in recent years, including in Parkland, Florida; Las Vegas; Thousand Oaks, California; Aurora, Colorado; Charleston, South Carolina; and Houston, Texas. In the wake of these tragedies, there have been angry demands for gun control and action against conspiracy theorists who harass victims' families. However, progress on gun control has stalled in Washington, with negligible action from the White House or Congress. 

Democrats are now feeling emboldened to lay out an aggressive new strategy on gun control, with a focus on background checks. They plan to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, despite potential blockage from the GOP-controlled Senate. This push for gun reform is being demanded as a priority by incoming House Democrats, with support from some Republicans. The strategy aims to win more bipartisan support and set a moral tone ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
