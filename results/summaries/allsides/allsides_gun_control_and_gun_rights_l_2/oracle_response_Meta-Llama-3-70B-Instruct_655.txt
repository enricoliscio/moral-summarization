SUMMARY:

Democrats are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a move aimed at curbing gun violence that bitterly divides America. The push comes after a series of mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 children and six school staff. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the demands for fresh action. The event will be joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, calling for change. The issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress despite pledges from Donald Trump. The current federal law requiring background checks is limited and often not well enforced, allowing gun violence to persist. Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
