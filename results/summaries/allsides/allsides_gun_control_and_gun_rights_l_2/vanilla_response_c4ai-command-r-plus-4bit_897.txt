SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, are pushing for stronger gun control measures at the start of a new legislative session. They are joined by House Democrats and anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and bereaved families, demanding action on an issue that bitterly divides America. The Democratic majority in the House is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of its first priorities. This push for gun control comes after recent mass shootings in Thousand Oaks, California, Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and other cities across the country. Federal law on background checks is limited and often not well enforced, and even bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats are feeling emboldened to set out a strident new strategy on gun control ahead of the 2020 presidential election, with 46 incoming House Democrats demanding that gun reform be a top priority. They are supported by some Republicans, such as Congressman Peter King, who has previously backed bipartisan legislation on the issue. The push for stronger gun control measures is part of a broader effort to curb gun violence and improve public safety in the United States.
