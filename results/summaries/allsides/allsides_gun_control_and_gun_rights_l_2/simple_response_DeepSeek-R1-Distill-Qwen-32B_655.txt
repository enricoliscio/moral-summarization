Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Democrats in the House planning to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. They're doing this after gaining a majority. The moral angle here is the push for gun control to prevent violence, especially after mass shootings like Sandy Hook and Parkland.

I should highlight the key points: the legislative push, the background checks, the involvement of affected families, and the political challenges like Republican control of the Senate. Also, mention the lawsuit against conspiracy theorists to show the ongoing struggles of victims' families.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clearâ€”emphasizing the desire for safety and the challenges faced in achieving it.

Let me structure it: start with the legislative initiative, mention the leaders, the event with survivors, the stalled progress, the lawsuit, and the political obstacles. Conclude with the Democrats' strategy and the challenges they face.

Make sure to include the moral framing by focusing on the desire to prevent gun violence and protect communities, highlighting the impact on families and the obstacles in Congress.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats in the U.S. House, now in the majority, plan to prioritize legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, following mass shootings like Sandy Hook and Parkland. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, will lead the push, joined by House Democrats and advocacy groups. The effort aims to address gun violence, a deeply divisive issue, with survivors and families of victims advocating for change. Despite federal laws, enforcement is weak, and bipartisan efforts have failed under Republican control. The GOP Senate could block Democratic bills, but Democrats hope to gain Republican support and set the agenda for the 2020 election. Meanwhile, the family of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner is suing conspiracy theorists who claim the massacre was a hoax, highlighting the ongoing trauma faced by victims' families. The push for gun control reflects a moral imperative to reduce violence and protect communities, despite political challenges.  
END OF SUMMARY.
