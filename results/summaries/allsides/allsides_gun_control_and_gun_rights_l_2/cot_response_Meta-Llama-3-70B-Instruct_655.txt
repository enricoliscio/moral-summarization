SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a bitterly divisive issue in America. The move comes after a series of tragic mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, which left 20 children and six school staff dead. Family members of victims from recent mass shootings will join the call to action on Capitol Hill, angrily demanding gun control. Despite previous pledges from Donald Trump, there has been negligible progress on curbing gun violence. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House is feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
