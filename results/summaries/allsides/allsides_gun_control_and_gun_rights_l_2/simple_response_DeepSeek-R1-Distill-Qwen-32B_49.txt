Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Democrats in the House planning to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. They're doing this after the midterm elections where they gained a majority. They're focusing on this issue because it's a major division in the US.

The key points are: 
- Democrats, especially those from Connecticut (Murphy and Blumenthal), are leading the charge after the Sandy Hook tragedy.
- They plan to introduce sweeping legislation, starting with background checks.
- There's an event on Capitol Hill with survivors and advocates.
- The issue has stalled in Washington despite Trump's promises after Parkland.
- Some Republican support exists but not enough to pass bills in the GOP-controlled Senate.
- Democrats hope to gain more Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election.

I need to highlight the moral aspect, emphasizing the push for gun control as a response to tragedies and the failure of previous efforts. Also, mention the stalled progress and the new strategy by Democrats.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
With a strengthened Democratic majority in the House, lawmakers are prioritizing gun control legislation, including universal background checks, as a response to America's ongoing gun violence crisis. This push follows the 2012 Sandy Hook tragedy and recent mass shootings, with Connecticut senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal leading the charge. Advocacy groups, survivors, and families of victims are joining the effort, emphasizing the need for action after years of stagnation in Washington. Despite bipartisan support for background checks, progress has been blocked by Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats aim to introduce sweeping legislation, hoping to garner Republican backing and set the stage for the 2020 election. The moral imperative to prevent gun violence is underscored by the failure of previous efforts and the persistent threat of mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
