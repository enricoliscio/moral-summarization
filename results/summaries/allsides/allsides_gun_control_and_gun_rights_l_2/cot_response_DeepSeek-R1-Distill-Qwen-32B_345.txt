Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Democrats introducing gun control legislation, specifically background checks, following the midterm elections. There are mentions of various mass shootings, advocacy groups, and political strategies.

For step one, I need to find words that carry moral weight. These are words that imply rightness, wrongness, or have a strong emotional connotation. I'll go through each paragraph and pick out such words. Words like "gun control," "background checks," "victims," "survivors," "conspiracy theorists," "harassment," "emboldened," "definitive action," "youth movement," "hoax," "conspiracy theorists," "harassment," "fear," "limited," "enforced," "bipartisan," "failed," "blocked," "emboldened," "strategy," "priority," "survivor," "campaign," "action," "stalled," "pledges," "movement," "hoax," "harassment," "feared," "languished," "support," "introduce," "action," "groups," "prevent," "alliance," "campaign."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral terms. I'll mention the Democrats' plans, the background checks, the mass shootings, the advocacy groups, the lawsuit against conspiracy theorists, the political challenges, and the strategies involved. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it too cluttered.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: starting with the Democrats' legislative push, the background on the shootings, the event on Capitol Hill, the lawsuit, the political landscape, and the strategies and support they're seeking. I'll ensure that each sentence includes a moral term where appropriate, like "gun control," "background checks," "victims," "conspiracy theorists," "harassment," etc.

I also need to be concise, so I'll combine related points and avoid unnecessary details. The key points are the legislative initiative, the context of past shootings, the event, the legal challenges, the political obstacles, and the strategic moves by Democrats. I'll make sure each of these is covered succinctly with the moral framing intact.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all important moral terms are included without making it sound forced. The summary should reflect the moral urgency and the political challenges accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Democratic majority in the House plans to introduce legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, following the midterm elections. This move comes after years of stalled progress on gun control, despite mass shootings like Sandy Hook, Parkland, and Las Vegas. Advocacy groups, survivors, and families of victims are joining calls for action. Federal background check laws are limited and poorly enforced, with bipartisan efforts failing under Republican control. Despite GOP control of the Senate, Democrats are emboldened to push for stricter gun control, aiming to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. A lawsuit filed by a Sandy Hook victim's father targets conspiracy theorists spreading false claims about the massacre. The event on Capitol Hill highlights the moral urgency of addressing gun violence and the challenges of political division. END OF SUMMARY.
