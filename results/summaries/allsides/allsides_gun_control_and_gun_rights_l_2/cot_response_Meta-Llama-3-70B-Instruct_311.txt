SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats, led by Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are launching a fresh push for stronger gun control, an issue that bitterly divides America. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a top priority in the incoming Congress. This aggressive new strategy comes after negligible progress from the White House or Congress, despite pledges from Donald Trump for definitive action to curb gun violence. Family members of victims from mass shootings, including the bereaved and angry, will join the call to action on Capitol Hill, demanding change. The event follows the annual national vigil for all victims of gun violence, highlighting the need for a strident approach to address this critical issue. END OF SUMMARY.
