SUMMARY:

Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are leading the charge for stronger gun control in the wake of devastating mass shootings that have left countless victims bereaved. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a crucial step towards progress on an issue that bitterly divides America. The event will bring together shooting survivors, advocacy groups, and family members of victims from mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, and other recent tragedies. Despite previous pledges from Donald Trump, the issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress from the White House or Congress. The federal law requiring background checks is limited and often not well enforced, allowing gun violence to persist. Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
