SUMMARY: Democrats in the House of Representatives are planning to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of their first priorities in the new Congress of 2019. This push for stronger gun control comes in the wake of numerous mass shootings that have bitterly divided America, including the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and the recent shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting took place, are leading the calls for action, demanding an end to gun violence and the harassment of victims' families. They are joined by advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, including family members of victims from Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, Aurora, Colorado, Charleston, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas. Lenny Pozner, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, has filed a lawsuit against conspiracy theorists who claim the massacre was a hoax. Despite negligible progress from the White House or Congress, Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set the agenda for the 2020 presidential election. The legislation is expected to be introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson and will be a top priority for the incoming Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
