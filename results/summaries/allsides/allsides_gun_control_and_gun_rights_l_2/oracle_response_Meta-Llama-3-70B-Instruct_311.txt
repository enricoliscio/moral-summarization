SUMMARY:

Democrats in the House are expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a crucial step towards progress on an issue that bitterly divides America. The move comes after years of inaction, despite devastating mass shootings that have left countless bereaved families in their wake. The push for stronger gun control is led by Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where 20 children and six school staff were gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012. They will be joined by House Democrats, shooting survivors, and advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, to demand change. The event follows the annual national vigil for all victims of gun violence, which honors the memories of those killed in shootings, massacres, and other violent incidents. Despite previous pledges from the White House and Congress, progress has been blocked, and the issue has languished. Democrats hope to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 presidential election.
