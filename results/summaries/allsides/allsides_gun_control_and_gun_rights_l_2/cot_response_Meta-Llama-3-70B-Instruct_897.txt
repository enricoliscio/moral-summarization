SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a move seen as a fresh and aggressive push for stronger gun control. The event will be joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, who are angrily demanding change. Despite bitter divisions, Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support. The issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress from the White House or Congress, despite pledges from Donald Trump for definitive action to curb gun violence. The push for gun reform comes as victims of mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy, continue to face harassment and fear for their lives. END OF SUMMARY.
