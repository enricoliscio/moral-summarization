SUMMARY:

In a bold move to address the devastating issue of gun violence in America, prominent Democrats are set to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. The push comes after years of inaction from the White House and Congress, despite numerous mass shootings and promises of reform. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy occurred, will lead the demands for change. The event will bring together House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved to call for action. The moral imperative is clear: it's time for America to take concrete steps to prevent further tragedies. The current federal law requiring background checks is limited and poorly enforced, and bipartisan efforts have failed to gain traction. Democrats are determined to make gun reform a top priority, hoping to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 presidential election.

END OF SUMMARY.
