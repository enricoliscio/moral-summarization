SUMMARY:

In a bold move to address the devastating issue of gun violence, Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. This effort is led by Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where the tragic Sandy Hook elementary school shooting occurred in 2012. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is determined to make progress on this critical issue, which has been stalled in Washington despite numerous mass shootings. Family members of victims from recent mass shootings will join the lawmakers and anti-gun violence advocacy groups on Capitol Hill to demand change. The event follows the annual national vigil for all victims of gun violence. While the GOP-controlled Senate may block the bill, Democrats are hopeful of winning more Republican support and setting a strong stance ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
