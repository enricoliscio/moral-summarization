Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Democrats in the House planning new gun control legislation, specifically background checks. They're pushing this after several mass shootings, highlighting the emotional impact on families. The author uses words like "violence," "massacre," and "killed," which carry strong moral weight. I should include these terms to maintain the original tone. Also, there's mention of stalled progress and blocked bills, which show the struggle against gun control. I'll need to succinctly capture these elements without exceeding 200 words. Let me structure it by starting with the legislative push, then the context of shootings, the emotional impact, and the challenges they face. I'll make sure to include key morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

SUMMARY:  
Prominent Democrats, including Connecticut senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are spearheading efforts to advance gun control legislation following recent mass shootings. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House plans to prioritize sweeping background check requirements as part of a bold new strategy. This initiative aims to address the deeply divisive issue of gun violence in America, with emotional appeals from survivors and families of victims, including those from Parkland, Las Vegas, and Sandy Hook. Despite federal laws, background checks are often poorly enforced, and bipartisan efforts have stalled under Republican control. The GOP Senate could block Democratic bills, but Democrats remain determined to push for progress, particularly ahead of the 2020 election. Advocacy groups like the Brady Campaign and Giffords are supporting the push, while some Republicans, like Peter King, have expressed openness to reform. The moral imperative is underscored by the persistent harassment of victims' families, such as Lenny Pozner, whose son Noah was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre. The legislative push aims to curb gun violence and prevent further tragedies.  
END OF SUMMARY.
