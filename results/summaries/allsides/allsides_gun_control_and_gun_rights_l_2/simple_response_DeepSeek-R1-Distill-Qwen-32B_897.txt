Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Democratic push for gun control legislation. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral angles.

First, the article talks about Democrats introducing legislation for background checks on all gun sales. They're doing this after the midterm elections where they gained a majority in the House. The moral framing here is about preventing gun violence and protecting communities, especially after mass shootings like Sandy Hook and Parkland.

I should highlight the leaders involved, like Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who have personal connections to the Sandy Hook tragedy. Their involvement adds a moral weight because they're representing victims and their families.

The article also mentions the event at St. Markâ€™s church, which is a vigil for gun violence victims. This shows the human impact and the emotional push behind the legislation. Including this event emphasizes the moral imperative to act.

Another point is the failure of past bipartisan efforts, especially under Republican control. This highlights the political obstacles but also the Democrats' renewed determination. The moral angle here is about accountability and leadership in addressing a national crisis.

There's also the lawsuit by Lenny Pozner against conspiracy theorists. This adds a layer of moral struggle, where not only are they fighting for legislation but also against misinformation and harassment. It shows the resilience of the victims' families and the need for truthful action.

The strategy includes targeting the 2020 election, which is a political move, but the moral framing is about setting a clear stance on gun control to protect future generations.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without losing the moral perspective. I'll structure it by starting with the legislative push, then the leaders, the event, the political challenges, the lawsuit, and the broader strategy.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear, focusing on the moral and emotional aspects. Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all key points while maintaining the author's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats in the U.S. Congress are launching a new push for gun control, leveraging their strengthened majority in the House to address the nation's deeply divided issue of gun violence. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook tragedy occurred, are leading calls for action. The House is expected to introduce legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, part of a bold strategy to combat gun violence. This effort will be supported by survivors, advocacy groups, and families of victims from mass shootings, including Parkland, Las Vegas, and Aurora. Despite stalled progress under previous Republican leadership, Democrats aim to win Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. Bipartisan efforts have failed in the past, but renewed momentum is emerging, with some Republicans like Peter King expressing openness to new legislation. The moral imperative to protect communities and prevent tragedies is central to this push, as families like Lenny Pozner's, whose son Noah was killed at Sandy Hook, continue to fight against conspiracy theories and harassment. END OF SUMMARY.
