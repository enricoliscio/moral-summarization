SUMMARY:
Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are leading a new push for stronger gun control in the wake of devastating mass shootings. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a "fresh" and "aggressive" strategy to address the bitterly divisive issue. The move comes as family members of victims from recent mass shootings, including Parkland and Las Vegas, demand "definitive" action to curb gun violence. Despite negligible progress from the White House or Congress, Democrats are feeling "emboldened" to take a stand, with 46 incoming House Democrats calling for gun reform to be a top priority. The push for change is expected to be met with resistance from the GOP-controlled Senate, but Democrats hope to win over Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 presidential election.
