SUMMARY:

In a bid to make progress on a bitterly divisive issue, prominent Democrats are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. The move comes after years of negligible progress from the White House or Congress, despite pledges to curb gun violence. The issue has been marred by tragedy, with mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, Aurora, Charleston, and Houston, leaving countless bereaved families in its wake. The recent shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, which claimed 12 lives, has added to the urgency. Family members of victims, including those from the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, will join Democrats on Capitol Hill to demand change. The event follows the annual national vigil for all victims of gun violence. Despite the GOP's control of the Senate, Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to win more Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
