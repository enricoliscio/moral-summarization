SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a priority for the new Congress. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the push for stronger gun control. The House Democratic majority is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks, following a report by Mother Jones. The move comes as the nation marks the anniversary of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, which killed 20 children and six staff members in 2012. Family members of victims from recent mass shootings will join lawmakers and advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign and Giffords, to call for change. Despite past pledges, progress on gun control has stalled in Washington. Democrats hope to win Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
