SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a crucial step towards progress on an issue that bitterly divides America. The move comes as prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where 20 children and six school staff were gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012, demand fresh action. The event will be joined by shooting survivors, the bereaved, and anti-gun violence advocacy groups, calling for change. The issue has stalled in Washington, with negligible progress from the White House or Congress, despite pledges from Donald Trump. Family members of victims from mass shootings are demanding gun control, including Lenny Pozner, whose six-year-old son Noah was killed at Sandy Hook, and is suing conspiracy theorists who claim the massacre was a hoax. Federal law requiring background checks is limited and often not well enforced, but Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control.

END OF SUMMARY.
