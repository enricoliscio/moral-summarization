SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats, including senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, are leading calls for stronger gun control measures in the United States. They are demanding fresh action to address gun violence, an issue that bitterly divides the nation. The Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as a priority in the 2019 Congress. This push for gun control is supported by advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and families bereaved by gun violence.

The event, held at Capitol Hill, follows the national vigil for victims of gun violence and comes in the wake of numerous mass shootings across the country, including the recent tragedy in Thousand Oaks, California. The issue has been stagnant in Washington, with little progress made despite promises from President Donald Trump to curb gun violence. However, Democrats are now emboldened to pursue a more aggressive strategy on gun control, aiming to gain Republican support and set their agenda for the 2020 presidential election.

The proposed legislation faces challenges with the GOP still controlling the Senate, but Democrats are determined to make their voices heard. Congressman Mike Thompson is expected to introduce a bill, joining other advocates for gun reform like Gabby Giffords and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. This unified push for stricter gun laws aims to protect Americans' lives and hold accountable those who contribute to the persistent issue of gun violence in the United States.
