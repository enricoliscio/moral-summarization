SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats, including Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, are planning to ramp up calls for stronger gun control measures in the United States. The newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is expected to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of its first priorities in 2019. This push for gun control is being supported by anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved. Family members of victims from mass shootings in Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, Aurora, Colorado, Charleston, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas are also demanding action. Despite pledges from President Donald Trump to curb gun violence, there has been little progress from the White House or Congress. Democrats are feeling emboldened to pursue a more aggressive strategy on gun control, with some Republicans also indicating their support for tightening background checks. The Democratic effort is being led by Congressman Mike Thompson, who is expected to introduce a bill, joined by Murphy, Blumenthal, and others. Advocacy groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords are also supporting the call to action.
END OF SUMMARY.
