SUMMARY:

Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales, a top priority for the new Congress. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, will lead the push for stronger gun control. The House Democratic majority is expected to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. The move comes after years of inaction on gun control, despite pledges from President Trump to take action after the Parkland shooting. Family members of victims from recent mass shootings will join lawmakers and advocacy groups on Capitol Hill to demand change. The event follows a national vigil for gun violence victims. While the GOP still controls the Senate, Democrats hope to win Republican support and set out their stall ahead of the 2020 presidential election.

END OF SUMMARY.
