Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Democrats in the U.S. Congress planning to push for stronger gun control measures, especially after the 2018 midterm elections where they gained a majority in the House. They want to introduce legislation for universal background checks on all gun sales. 

The article mentions specific senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who are leading this push, especially since they were affected by the Sandy Hook shooting. There's an event planned with survivors and advocacy groups. 

It also talks about how progress on gun control has been stalled, despite President Trump's promises after the Parkland shooting. There's a lawsuit mentioned from a Sandy Hook victim's family against conspiracy theorists. 

The summary needs to include the key points: the new strategy by Democrats, the background checks legislation, the event on Capitol Hill, the stalled progress, and the lawsuit. Also, mention that while the House is Democratic, the Senate is still Republican, so bills might be blocked, but Democrats are hopeful for 2020.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important point is covered.

SUMMARY:  
With a Democratic majority in the House, lawmakers plan to prioritize legislation requiring universal background checks on all gun sales. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, will lead the push, marking the start of a new gun control initiative. The effort follows years of stagnation in Washington, despite mass shootings like Sandy Hook, Parkland, and Las Vegas. Advocacy groups, survivors, and families of victims will join the call for action on Capitol Hill. While the Republican-controlled Senate may block bills, Democrats aim to gain Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. Federal background checks are currently limited and poorly enforced, and bipartisan efforts have failed under GOP control. The lawsuit by Lenny Pozner, whose son was killed in Sandy Hook, highlights the ongoing challenges faced by victims' families. END OF SUMMARY.
