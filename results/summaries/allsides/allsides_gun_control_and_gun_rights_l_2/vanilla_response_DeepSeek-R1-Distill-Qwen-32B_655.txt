Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Democrats introducing gun control legislation. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the Democratic majority in the House plans to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. That's a major point. They're doing this as one of their first priorities in the new Congress.

The article also talks about specific senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who are leading the push. They're holding an event with other Democrats and anti-gun violence groups. They're bringing in families affected by mass shootings in places like Parkland, Las Vegas, and others.

It's important to note that despite previous promises, especially from Trump after the Parkland shooting, there's been little progress. The article also mentions a lawsuit from a Sandy Hook parent against conspiracy theorists, which adds context about the ongoing challenges they face.

Additionally, the Senate is still controlled by Republicans, so any legislation passed by the House could be blocked. However, Democrats are pushing forward, hoping to gain some Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements. I'll structure it to mention the legislation, the leaders, the event, the stalled progress, the lawsuit, and the political strategy. I'll avoid getting too bogged down in details and keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY:  
The Democratic majority in the House plans to prioritize legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales as part of a new push for stronger gun control. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, will lead the effort, following the Sandy Hook shooting. The initiative, expected to be introduced in the 2019 Congress, aims to address the stalled issue of gun violence in Washington. Advocacy groups, survivors, and families of victims from mass shootings, including Parkland, Las Vegas, and others, will join the call for action. Despite bipartisan attempts, previous efforts under Republican control failed. With the Democratic House majority, lawmakers hope to gain Republican support and influence the 2020 election. A lawsuit by a Sandy Hook parent highlights ongoing challenges, as conspiracy theorists continue to spread misinformation. END OF SUMMARY.
