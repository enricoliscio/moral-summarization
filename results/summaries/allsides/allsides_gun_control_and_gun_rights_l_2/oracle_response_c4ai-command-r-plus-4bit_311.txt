SUMMARY: In the wake of recent gun violence and mass shootings in the United States, prominent Democrats are calling for stronger gun control measures and plan to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut where the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred, are leading these demands for progress on gun control. They are joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, and individuals personally affected by gun violence. The issue has bitterly divided America, and despite pledges from President Donald Trump, negligible progress has been made at the federal level. Democrats are now emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control, hoping to gain more Republican support and make it a priority for the incoming Congress. The legislation is expected to be introduced by the Democratic majority in the House, but it may face challenges in the Republican-controlled Senate. This push for gun reform comes amidst ongoing harassment and threats faced by family members of victims, such as Lenny Pozner, who lost his son in the Sandy Hook shooting and has been targeted by conspiracy theorists.
