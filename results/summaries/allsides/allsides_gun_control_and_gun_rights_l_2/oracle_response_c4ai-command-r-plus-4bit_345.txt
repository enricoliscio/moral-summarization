SUMMARY: In the wake of recent tragic mass shootings in the United States, prominent Democrats are calling for stronger gun control legislation and plan to introduce sweeping bills to impose background checks on all gun sales. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut where the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred, are leading the push for progress on an issue that bitterly divides the nation. They are joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, demanding action to curb gun violence.

The issue has stalled in Washington despite pledges from President Donald Trump to take definitive action after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in 2018. Families of victims from mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, Aurora, Charleston, and Houston are among those calling for change. The Democratic majority in the House is expected to introduce legislation as one of its first priorities, despite potential blockage by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Lenny Pozner, whose son Noah was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, has filed a lawsuit against conspiracy theorists who claim the massacre was a hoax. Pozner has faced harassment and even feared for his life due to persistent harassment. Federal law on background checks is limited and poorly enforced, and even bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have languished in Congress. Democrats are feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy on gun control ahead of the 2020 election, with support from advocacy groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords.
