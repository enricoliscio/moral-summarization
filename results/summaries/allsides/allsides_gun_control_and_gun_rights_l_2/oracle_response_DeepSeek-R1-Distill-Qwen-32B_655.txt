Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Democrats in the House planning new gun control legislation, specifically background checks on all gun sales. They're pushing this as a priority after the midterm elections. The article mentions several mass shootings, like Sandy Hook and Parkland, and how families of victims are advocating for change. There's also a lawsuit against conspiracy theorists who claim the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax. The author uses words like "violence," "shooting," "killed," and "blocked" which carry moral weight.

I need to make sure my summary includes these morally charged words. I should focus on the key actions: introducing legislation, background checks, the involvement of specific congressmen, and the context of past shootings. I also need to mention the stalled progress and Republican opposition, as well as the lawsuit against conspiracy theorists. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to highlight the push for gun control, the emotional context from victims' families, and the political challenges they face.

Let me start by outlining the main points: Democrats introducing legislation, background checks, mass shootings mentioned, families advocating, stalled progress, Republican control, and the lawsuit. I'll make sure to include words like "legislation," "violence," "shooting," "killed," "blocked," etc., to maintain the moral framing. I'll also keep the summary concise, ensuring each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats in the House plan to introduce legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, marking a new push for gun control following the midterm elections. Prominent figures like Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, will lead calls for action, alongside families of victims from mass shootings in Sandy Hook, Parkland, Las Vegas, and others. The event coincides with a national vigil for gun violence victims. Despite federal laws and bipartisan efforts, progress has stalled under Republican-controlled Congress, with bills often blocked or languishing. Democrats aim to set a strident new strategy, hoping to gain Republican support and prepare for the 2020 election. Meanwhile, Lenny Pozner, father of a Sandy Hook victim, filed a lawsuit against conspiracy theorists claiming the massacre was a hoax, highlighting the ongoing harassment and fear faced by victims' families. The push for gun reform faces significant political and emotional challenges, with violence and division persisting in the U.S.
