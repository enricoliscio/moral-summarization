Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about Democrats in the U.S. House planning to introduce legislation for background checks on all gun sales. They're doing this after the midterm elections, where they gained a majority. The key players mentioned are Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who are leading the push. They're organizing an event with other Democrats and anti-gun violence groups.

The article also mentions several mass shootings, like Parkland, Las Vegas, and Aurora, highlighting the ongoing issue of gun violence. It notes that despite past promises, little progress has been made in Washington. There's a lawsuit from a Sandy Hook parent suing conspiracy theorists, which adds context about the challenges they face.

Additionally, it discusses the political landscape: the Senate is still under Republican control, so any House-passed bills might be blocked. However, Democrats are hopeful and plan to make gun reform a top priority, aiming to gain Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. Congressman Mike Thompson is expected to introduce a bill, and there's mention of bipartisan support from Peter King.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the legislative push, key figures, the event, the background on stalled progress, and the political strategy. I should also include the lawsuit as it shows the challenges they face. Let me structure this clearly, making sure each point is concise and flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats in the U.S. House, now in the majority, plan to prioritize legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales, following the midterm elections. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, representing Connecticut, will lead the push, alongside House Democrats and anti-gun violence groups. The initiative follows mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, and other cities, with little progress on gun control in Washington despite President Trump's promises. A lawsuit by Lenny Pozner, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, targets conspiracy theorists claiming the massacre was a hoax. Federal background check laws are limited, and bipartisan efforts have failed under Republican control. While the GOP still controls the Senate, Democrats aim to advance their gun control agenda, hoping to gain Republican support and set the stage for the 2020 election. Congressman Mike Thompson is expected to introduce a bill, with bipartisan backing from Peter King. The event on Capitol Hill will include advocacy groups like the Brady Campaign and Giffords.  
END OF SUMMARY.
