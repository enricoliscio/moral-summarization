SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats, including senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, are leading a new push for stronger gun control legislation in the United States. They are demanding action to address the bitterly divisive issue of gun violence that has plagued the nation. The Democratic majority in the House of Representatives plans to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as a top priority. This push for progress comes in the wake of numerous tragic shootings and massacres that have left countless bereaved and traumatized, including the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and the recent shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. The issue has been stalled in Washington, with negligible progress despite pledges from President Donald Trump. Victims' family members and advocacy groups are calling for change and demanding gun control to curb gun violence and prevent further loss of life. Federal law on background checks is limited and poorly enforced, and even bipartisan efforts to strengthen them have languished in Congress. Democrats are now feeling emboldened to lay out a strident new strategy, hoping to gain more Republican support and make a stand ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
END OF SUMMARY.
