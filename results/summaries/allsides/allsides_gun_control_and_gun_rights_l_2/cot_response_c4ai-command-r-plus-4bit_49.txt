SUMMARY: Prominent Democrats are pushing for stronger gun control, demanding fresh action and an aggressive new strategy to impose background checks on all gun sales. This call for change is supported by advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and the bereaved, including those impacted by mass shootings in Parkland, Las Vegas, and Sandy Hook. While negligible progress has been made at the federal level, with pledges from the White House and Congress stalling, Democrats are feeling emboldened to take control of the issue. They aim to win over more Republican support and set their strategy ahead of the 2020 election. The issue of gun control has been further complicated by conspiracy theorists, who have harassed and targeted the bereaved, forcing some to move and even fear for their lives. The legislation to strengthen background checks has failed to gain traction in the Republican-controlled Congress, but with a new Democratic majority in the House, there is hope for change. This push for gun reform is being demanded as a priority by incoming House Democrats, who are expected to introduce fresh legislation to address this pressing issue. END OF SUMMARY.
