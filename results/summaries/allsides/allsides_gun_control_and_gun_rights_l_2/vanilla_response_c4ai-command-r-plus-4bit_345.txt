SUMMARY: Democrats in the House of Representatives are planning to introduce sweeping legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales as one of their first priorities for the incoming Congress in 2019. This push for stronger gun control is being led by senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, the state where the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred in 2012. They will be joined by House Democrats, anti-gun violence advocacy groups, shooting survivors, and bereaved families calling for change. The event follows the national vigil for victims of gun violence and comes after recent mass shootings in Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, Thousand Oaks, California, and other cities across the US. Despite pledges from President Trump to curb gun violence, there has been little progress on the issue in Washington. Democrats are feeling emboldened to pursue a more aggressive strategy on gun control, hoping to gain more Republican support and set the agenda for the 2020 presidential election. A bill to tighten background checks is expected to be introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson, with support from other Democrats and advocacy groups.
END OF SUMMARY.
