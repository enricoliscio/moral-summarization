SUMMARY:

In a bold move to tackle the scourge of gun violence, Democratic lawmakers are set to introduce legislation to impose background checks on all gun sales. This comes after years of inaction from the White House and Congress, despite repeated tragedies and broken promises. The push is led by Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who represent Connecticut, where the devastating Sandy Hook massacre occurred in 2012. They will be joined by House Democrats, survivors of mass shootings, and advocacy groups to demand change. The event follows a national vigil for gun violence victims and comes as the country mourns the latest mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. The proposed legislation aims to strengthen federal law, which is currently limited and poorly enforced. While the GOP-controlled Senate may block the bill, Democrats are determined to make gun control a top priority ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
