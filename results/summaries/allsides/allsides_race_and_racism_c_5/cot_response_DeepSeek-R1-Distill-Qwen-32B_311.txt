Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Joe Biden and Cory Booker criticizing Trump for his rhetoric related to white supremacy and mass shootings. 

The user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "fueled," "white supremacy," "mass shootings," "condemn," "racism," "bigotry," "hatred," "anti-immigrant," "invasion," "reform," "licenses," "stricter," "darkness," "toxic," "hate," "racism," and "division" stand out as having strong moral implications.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article. I'll mention Biden and Booker's accusations against Trump, the context of the mass shootings, Trump's response, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main arguments from both Biden and Booker, Trump's stance, and the broader implications for the election. I'll keep it clear and to the point, ensuring all the important moral elements are included without going over the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  

Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have accused President Donald Trump of fostering white supremacy and hatred through his rhetoric, linking it to recent mass shootings. Biden criticized Trump for "fanning the flames of white supremacy" and drawing parallels between Trump's anti-immigrant language and the El Paso shooter's manifesto. Booker emphasized the need to address racism and white supremacy, rather than focusing on whether Trump is a racist. Trump, who denies being racist, has proposed mental health reforms and curbing gun access for potentially violent individuals but has not called for major gun law changes. Protesters greeted Trump during his visits to El Paso and Dayton. Biden and Booker are among 24 Democratic candidates seeking to oppose Trump in the 2020 election, with most advocating for stricter gun laws. Biden and Booker have condemned Trump's "toxic" and divisive rhetoric, urging unity against hate and racism.  

END OF SUMMARY.
