Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first. It's about Joe Biden and Cory Booker accusing Trump of fueling white supremacy, which led to recent mass shootings. Trump visited the affected cities and addressed the issue, but his rhetoric is being criticized.

I should start by identifying the main points. Biden and Booker are the Democratic candidates speaking out. They're linking Trump's words to the shootings. The shootings in El Paso and Dayton are mentioned, with the El Paso shooter targeting Hispanics. Trump's response includes mental health and social media monitoring, but not gun law changes.

I need to keep the moral angle, so I should highlight how the candidates are framing Trump's actions as contributing to the violence. Also, include Trump's denial and his proposed solutions. Mention the candidates' calls for stricter gun laws and their focus on addressing racism and gun violence.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by introducing the accusations, the shootings, Trump's response, and the candidates' proposed solutions. Also, note the moral stance they're taking against Trump's rhetoric.

Let me draft it: Start with Biden and Booker's accusations, mention the shootings, Trump's response and denial, their focus on gun control and addressing white supremacy, and the moral framing against Trump's words.

I think that covers all the key points without losing the moral perspective. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for allegedly fueling white supremacy, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings. Biden accused Trump of using "clear language and code" to promote white supremacy, while Booker focused on addressing the roots of hate crimes. The weekend shootings in El Paso and Dayton, targeting Hispanics and resulting in 31 deaths, intensified scrutiny of Trump's inflammatory language, such as describing immigration as an "invasion." Trump, who denies racism, called for mental health reforms and social media monitoring but avoided major gun law changes. Biden and Booker, among other Democrats, advocate for stricter gun control, including universal background checks and assault weapon bans, while emphasizing the need to confront racism and division. END OF SUMMARY.
