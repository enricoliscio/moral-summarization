SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which are blamed for recent US mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have consequences. Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also spoke out against white nationalism and gun violence, saying that these acts of hatred are "harvested" after being "planted". Trump, who has denied being a racist, called for condemnation of racism, bigotry, and white supremacy in a speech on Monday. The weekend's mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton have intensified criticism of Trump's rhetoric, with many calling for stricter gun laws. Biden and Booker are among 24 candidates vying to take on Trump in the 2020 election.
