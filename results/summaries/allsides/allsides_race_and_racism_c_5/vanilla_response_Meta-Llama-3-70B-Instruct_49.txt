SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that led to recent mass shootings in the US. Biden said Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have consequences. Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also spoke out against white nationalism and gun violence, saying that these acts of hatred are "harvested" from rhetoric that has been "planted". Trump visited the cities where the shootings occurred and was met with protesters. He proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters, but stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates, including Biden and Booker, are calling for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons.

END OF SUMMARY.
