SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Donald Trump of encouraging white supremacy beliefs that are blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden delivered a fiery speech in Iowa, claiming that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" through his rhetoric and policies. Senator Cory Booker, speaking at the South Carolina church where a white supremacist killed nine people in 2015, echoed similar sentiments. They both highlighted the connections between Trump's language, including referring to immigrants as "an invasion," and the El Paso shooter's manifesto, which expressed hatred towards Hispanics. Trump's response to the shootings has been criticized for falling short of addressing gun law reforms. Instead, he focused on mental health reforms and keeping guns away from potentially violent individuals. The Democratic candidates have called for stricter gun laws, including background checks and banning assault-style weapons. Biden and Booker's remarks emphasize their stance against racism and division, urging action to address these issues.
END OF SUMMARY.
