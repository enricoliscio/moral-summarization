SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, blaming him for the recent U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and has a "toxic tongue" that promotes "hate, racism, and division." Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum, but are harvested from the seeds of white nationalism and racism. Trump's response to the shootings was criticized for not addressing the root cause of the problem, instead proposing reforms to mental health laws and social media monitoring. The Democrats have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. The debate has shifted from whether Trump is a racist to who is doing something to address the problem of racism and white supremacy. END OF SUMMARY.
