SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have strongly criticized President Donald Trump's rhetoric on race, accusing him of fueling white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the US. Biden, in a fiery speech, argued that Trump has aligned himself with dark forces in the nation and has embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division. He also drew connections between Trump's language and the El Paso shooter's manifesto, stating that the president's rhetoric has dangerous implications. Meanwhile, Booker, speaking at the church where a devastating shooting took place in 2015, emphasized that acts of hatred are cultivated and harvested. Both candidates called for action against racism and white supremacy, with Biden invoking past presidents who opposed hate and Booker urging a focus on addressing the issues rather than debating labels. The criticism comes as Trump visited El Paso and Dayton, where mass shootings took place, and proposed reforms on mental health and social media, while stopping short of advocating for major gun law changes.
