SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that led to several U.S. mass shootings, including the recent ones in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Trump, who has denied being a racist, called for condemning "racism, bigotry and white supremacy" in a speech, but stopped short of proposing major gun law reforms. Biden and other Democratic contenders, including Cory Booker, emphasized the need to address white nationalism and gun violence, with Booker noting that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the problem. The candidates have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
