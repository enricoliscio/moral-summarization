Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker criticizing Trump's rhetoric after mass shootings. They used specific morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Biden accuses Trump of fueling white supremacy, which led to the shootings. Booker talks about white nationalism and gun violence. Trump denied being racist but proposed some measures without major gun law changes. There were two mass shootings: one targeting Hispanics and another in Dayton.

I need to highlight the moral terms like "shootings," "killed," "supremacy," "hatred," etc. I'll structure the summary to include Biden and Booker's accusations, Trump's response, and the context of the shootings. Also, mention the proposed solutions and the political implications.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the moral framing words as much as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me start drafting: mention the candidates, their accusations, the shootings, Trump's rhetoric, his response, and the political stance. Make sure each moral term is included where appropriate.

Check the word count to ensure it's concise. Maybe combine some sentences to save space. Also, ensure the flow is logical, moving from the accusations to the shootings, Trump's response, and the proposed solutions.

Alright, I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary that preserves the moral elements the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for fueling white supremacy and hate, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings. Biden accused Trump of "fanning the flames of white supremacy," while Booker emphasized that acts of hatred are rooted in planted seeds of division. The weekend's shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which killed 31 people, intensified scrutiny of Trump's inflammatory language, including his description of immigration as an "invasion." Trump denied racism but proposed measures like mental health reforms and social media monitoring, avoiding major gun law changes. Biden and Booker called for stricter gun control, including background checks and bans on assault weapons. Trump's rhetoric and policies have been condemned by Democrats, who argue his words align with hate and division. The candidates focused on addressing systemic racism and hate, rejecting debates over Trump's personal racism and instead emphasizing action to combat these issues. END OF SUMMARY.
