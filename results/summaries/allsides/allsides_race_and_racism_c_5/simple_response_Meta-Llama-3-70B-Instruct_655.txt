SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runners Joe Biden and Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which they blame for recent mass shootings in the US. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have been a catalyst for hate crimes. Booker echoed this sentiment, saying that these acts of hatred are "harvested" from the rhetoric of leaders. Trump, who has denied being a racist, called for condemnation of racism and white supremacy in a speech, but Biden and Booker argue that his words ring hollow. They point to Trump's previous rhetoric, such as calling immigration an "invasion," as contributing to a culture of hate. The Democrats are calling for stricter gun laws and action against white supremacy, while Trump's proposals focus on mental health reform and social media detection. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Trump's rhetoric and policies are seen as perpetuating hate and division, while the Democrats are advocating for a more inclusive and compassionate approach.
