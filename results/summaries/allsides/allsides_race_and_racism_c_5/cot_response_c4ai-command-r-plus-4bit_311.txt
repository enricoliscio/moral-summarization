SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy and blamed him for several mass shootings in the U.S. Biden and other Democratic contenders criticized Trump's incendiary rhetoric and hard-line immigration policies, accusing him of aligning with the "darkest forces in the nation". They condemned racism, bigotry, and white supremacy, and called for action to address these issues. In response to the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump proposed mental health reforms and improving social media detection of potential shooters, but stopped short of supporting major gun law reforms. Trump's rhetoric, such as calling Central American immigrants "an invasion," has been criticized for its potential influence on the El Paso shooter's anti-immigrant hatred. The Democratic candidates, including Biden and Cory Booker, have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the issues of white nationalism and gun violence. They emphasize the need to address racism and white supremacy, not just debate whether Trump is a racist. END OF SUMMARY.
