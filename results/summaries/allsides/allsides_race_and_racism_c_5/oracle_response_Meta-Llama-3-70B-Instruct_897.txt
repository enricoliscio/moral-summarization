SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused Republican President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have led to several U.S. mass shootings, including the recent rampages in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Another contender, Cory Booker, emphasized that these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum, but are "harvested" from the rhetoric of leaders like Trump. Trump's aides deny that his rhetoric was a cause of the shootings, but many critics argue that his language, including calling immigrants an "invasion," has contributed to the problem. Biden and Booker, along with most Democratic candidates, are calling for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons, to combat the scourge of gun violence and white nationalism.
