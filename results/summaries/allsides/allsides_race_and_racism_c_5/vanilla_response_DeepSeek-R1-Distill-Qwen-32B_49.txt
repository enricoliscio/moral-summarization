Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the recent mass shootings and their accusations against Trump. 

Biden says Trump's rhetoric has fueled white supremacy, leading to the shootings. He mentions the president's coded language and direct statements. Booker talks about hate and its roots, focusing on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a white supremacist killed nine people. 

The article also covers the two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, both linked to hate. Trump has denied being racist and has proposed some measures like mental health reforms and working with social media, but not major gun law changes. He visited the affected cities but faced protests. 

The Democrats, including Biden and Booker, are pushing for stricter gun laws. Biden criticizes Trump's alignment with hate, while Booker shifts the focus from Trump's racism to the actions needed to combat it. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Biden and Booker's accusations, the shootings, Trump's response, and the Democratic candidates' stance on gun laws. I'll make sure to include key points like the president's rhetoric, the shootings' causes, and the proposed solutions. 

Let me structure it: first, Biden's accusation, then Booker's speech, the details of the shootings, Trump's response, the protests, and the Democratic candidates' positions. I'll keep it concise, ensuring each main point is covered without extra details. 

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for allegedly fueling white supremacy, citing his rhetoric as a factor in recent mass shootings. Biden accused Trump of using "clear language and code" to promote white supremacy, while Booker focused on addressing hate and its roots during a speech at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The weekend shootings in El Paso and Dayton, linked to anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant hatred, intensified scrutiny of Trump's inflammatory statements. Trump denied racism, calling for unity and proposing measures like mental health reforms and social media monitoring, but stopped short of advocating major gun law changes. He faced protests during visits to the affected cities. Biden and Booker are among 24 Democratic candidates seeking to oppose Trump in the 2020 election, with most advocating stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and assault weapon bans. Biden and Booker emphasized the need to combat hate and division, with Booker shifting focus from Trump's alleged racism to the actions required to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
