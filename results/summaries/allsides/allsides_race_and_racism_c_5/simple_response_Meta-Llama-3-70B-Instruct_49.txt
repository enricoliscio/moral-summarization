SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that led to recent mass shootings in the US. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have consequences, citing the El Paso shooter's manifesto that echoed Trump's anti-immigrant sentiments. Booker emphasized that white nationalism and gun violence are interconnected and that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a toxic environment. Both candidates called for stricter gun laws and condemned Trump's response to the shootings, which they deemed inadequate. The moral framing of this article is clear: Trump's rhetoric is morally reprehensible and has emboldened white supremacists, leading to devastating consequences. The candidates' strong stance against hate and racism serves as a moral imperative for the nation.
