SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which are blamed for several US mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have been "a call to action for white supremacists." Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also spoke out against white nationalism and gun violence, saying that these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum, but are harvested after being planted. Trump visited the cities where the mass shootings occurred and proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters. However, he stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates, including Biden and Booker, have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons.
