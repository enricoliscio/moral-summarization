SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs blamed for several U.S. mass shootings. In a speech in Iowa, Biden condemned Trump's rhetoric, saying he has "fanned the flames of white supremacy." Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, echoed similar themes in a speech at the South Carolina church where a white supremacist fatally shot nine people in 2015. The recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton have intensified criticism of Trump's incendiary language and hard-line immigration policies. Biden and Booker criticized Trump's response to the shootings and called for stricter gun laws. They argued that Trump has aligned himself with forces of hate, racism, and division in the nation. Booker emphasized the need to address racism and white supremacy head-on, regardless of individual opinions on Trump's character.

END OF SUMMARY.
