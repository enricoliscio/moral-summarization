SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused Republican President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have led to several U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and has a "toxic tongue" that has "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Trump visited two cities where 31 people were killed in rampages last weekend, and Biden criticized Trump's response, saying it stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Other Democratic contenders, such as Cory Booker, also condemned Trump's rhetoric, saying it has contributed to a culture of white nationalism and gun violence. Booker emphasized that the issue is not whether Trump is a racist, but rather who is doing something to address the problem of racism and white supremacy. END OF SUMMARY.
