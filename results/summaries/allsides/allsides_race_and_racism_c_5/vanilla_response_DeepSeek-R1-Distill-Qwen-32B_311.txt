Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Joe Biden and Cory Booker's reactions to the recent mass shootings. The article mentions that Biden accused Trump of fueling white supremacy, while Booker focused on addressing the issues of hate and gun violence. I should note the key points: the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump's response, and the political implications for the 2020 election.

First, I'll start by identifying the main events. There were two mass shootings over the weekend, one targeting Hispanics and the other resulting in nine deaths, including the shooter's sister. The article connects these events to Trump's rhetoric, which some argue incites hatred.

Next, Biden's speech in Iowa is important. He criticized Trump for promoting white supremacy and linked Trump's words to the shootings. I should include that Biden mentioned Trump's "toxic tongue" and how his rhetoric has contributed to the problem.

Then, Cory Booker's speech in Charleston is another key point. He emphasized that hate doesn't occur in a vacuum and focused on taking action against these issues rather than debating Trump's racism. This shows the Democratic candidates' strategies in addressing the shootings.

I should also mention Trump's response, where he condemned racism but stopped short of major gun law reforms. His visit to the affected cities was met with protests, highlighting the political tension.

Lastly, the article notes that most Democrats are pushing for stricter gun laws, which is a significant policy difference from Trump's approach.

Putting it all together, I need to condense these points into a concise summary under 200 words, ensuring all key elements are covered without going into too much detail. I'll structure it by first mentioning the shootings, then Biden's and Booker's reactions, Trump's response, and the broader implications for the election.
