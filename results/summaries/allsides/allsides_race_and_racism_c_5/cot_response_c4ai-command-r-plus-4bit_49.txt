SUMMARY: 
Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs blamed for recent mass shootings in the U.S. In speeches, Biden and Booker argued that Trump's divisive rhetoric, including his characterization of Central American migrants as "an invasion," has emboldened white supremacists and contributed to a culture of hate and racism. Trump, who has denied being a racist, visited El Paso and Dayton, the sites of the recent shootings, and proposed reforms focusing on mental health and social media detection rather than gun control. Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic candidates, advocate for stricter gun laws. They assert that Trump's inflammatory language and alignment with "darkest forces" have created an environment conducive to acts of hatred and violence. While Trump aides refute these claims, Biden and Booker maintain that the president's toxic rhetoric and failure to address racism and white supremacy are detrimental to the nation. They believe that Trump's actions and words carry moral implications that cannot be ignored.
