Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the recent mass shootings and their accusations against Trump. 

So, the key points are: Biden and Booker are Democratic candidates. They're criticizing Trump for fueling white supremacy, which they link to the shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Trump visited both cities and addressed the issue, but his rhetoric is under fire. 

I should note the main events: the shootings, Trump's response, Biden's accusations, Booker's speech, and the policy differences, especially on gun control. Also, mention that Trump's supporters deny his words caused the violence.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main accusations, the context of the shootings, and the political implications. Make sure to include both candidates' perspectives and the reactions from Trump's side.

Let me structure it: start with Biden and Booker's accusations, mention the shootings, Trump's response, their proposed solutions, and the ongoing debate. Keep it concise and clear.
