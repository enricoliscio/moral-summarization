Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and then write a concise summary using those words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Joe Biden and Cory Booker accusing Trump of fueling white supremacy, which led to mass shootings. Trump's rhetoric is criticized for being incendiary, and he's denied being racist. The article also mentions the specifics of the shootings and the political responses.

For the first step, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that express judgment or moral evaluation. Words like "accused," "fueling," "white supremacy," "hate," "bigotry," "condemn," "racism," "harvested," "planted," "incendiary," "condemnation," "invasion," "toxic," "hate," "division," "address," "problem," "reform," "stricter," "license," "oppose," "embrace," "darkness," "strategy," "exist," "something," "doing." These words all carry moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Biden and Booker's accusations against Trump, the shootings, Trump's response, the criticism of his rhetoric, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should structure the summary to first mention Biden and Booker's accusations, then describe the shootings and their context, followed by Trump's response and the political reactions. I'll ensure that the summary flows logically and includes the key moral terms identified earlier.

I need to be concise, so I'll combine related points where possible. For example, mentioning both Biden and Booker's statements together, then moving on to the shootings, and then Trump's reaction. I'll also highlight the political divide and the calls for stricter gun laws.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all the key moral points are included. I'll make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the moral framing provided by the authors.

**SUMMARY:**  
Joe Biden and Cory Booker accused Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy and hate through his rhetoric, linking it to recent mass shootings. Biden criticized Trump for embracing a "toxic" and divisive strategy, while Booker focused on addressing racism and white supremacy rather than debating Trump's racism. The shootings in El Paso and Dayton, driven by hatred toward Hispanics and others, sparked criticism of Trump's incendiary language, such as calling immigration an "invasion." Trump denied racism, calling for mental health reform and social media monitoring but avoiding gun law changes. Biden and Booker, among other Democrats, advocate for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons. The article highlights the moral divide over Trump's rhetoric and the need to confront racism and hate. END OF SUMMARY.
