SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden and Cory Booker, have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Biden, in a speech in Iowa, said that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" through his rhetoric and policies, exposing himself to renewed condemnation following the El Paso shooting. Booker, speaking at the church in Charleston where a white supremacist killed nine people in 2015, echoed similar sentiments and called for action against racism and white supremacy. The weekend's mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which left 31 people dead, have intensified criticism of Trump's incendiary language and hard-line immigration policies. Trump, who visited El Paso and Dayton on Wednesday, has denied that his rhetoric was a cause of the shootings and proposed reforms to mental health laws and social media monitoring instead of major gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the issues of white nationalism and gun violence in their campaigns.
