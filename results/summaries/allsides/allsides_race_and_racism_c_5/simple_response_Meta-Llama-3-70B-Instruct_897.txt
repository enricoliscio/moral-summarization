SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which they blame for several US mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have consequences, citing the El Paso shooter's manifesto that echoed Trump's "invasion" rhetoric. Booker emphasized that acts of hatred don't happen in a vacuum, but are harvested from the seeds of white nationalism and racism. Both candidates called for stricter gun laws and condemned Trump's rhetoric, with Biden saying that Trump has aligned himself with the "darkest forces" in the nation. The president, however, denied any responsibility, instead proposing reforms to mental health laws and social media detection of potential mass shooters. The candidates' moral framing emphasizes the need for accountability and action against racism and white supremacy.
