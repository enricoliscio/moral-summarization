Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker accusing Trump of promoting white supremacy, leading to mass shootings. I should highlight the key points: Biden's accusation, the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump's response, and the candidates' positions on gun control and rhetoric.

First, I'll mention Biden's speech in Iowa, his criticism of Trump's rhetoric. Then, Booker's speech in Charleston, emphasizing the roots of hate. I should include details about the shootings, the suspects' motivations, and Trump's proposed solutions without major gun law changes.

Also, note the protests against Trump and the Democrats' stance on stricter gun laws. Keep the summary concise, under 200 words, focusing on the moral aspects like hate, division, and responsibility.

SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for allegedly fueling white supremacy and hate, citing recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Biden accused Trump of using "clear language and code" to promote white supremacy, while Booker emphasized the roots of hate and the need for action against racism. The shootings, driven by anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant hatred, have intensified scrutiny of Trump's rhetoric, such as his description of immigrants as an "invasion." Trump has denied racism, calling for unity and proposing measures like mental health reforms and social media monitoring, but not major gun law changes. Biden and Booker are among 24 Democratic candidates vying to oppose Trump in 2020, with most advocating for stricter gun control. The candidates have focused on addressing hate and division, rejecting Trump's rhetoric and urging action against racism. END OF SUMMARY.
