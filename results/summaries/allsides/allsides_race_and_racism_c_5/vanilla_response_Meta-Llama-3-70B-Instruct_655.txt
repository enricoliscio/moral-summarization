SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which are blamed for several US mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" in the nation. Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also addressed the issue of white nationalism and gun violence in a speech at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The weekend's back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton have intensified criticism of Trump's rhetoric, which many say is incendiary. Trump has proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters, but stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates, including Biden and Booker, have called for stricter gun laws. The candidates' remarks come as Trump visited the cities affected by the mass shootings, where he was greeted by protesters.
