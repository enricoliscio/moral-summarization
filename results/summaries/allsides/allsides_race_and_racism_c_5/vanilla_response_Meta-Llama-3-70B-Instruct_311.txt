SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which are blamed for several US mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" in the nation. Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also spoke out against white nationalism and gun violence, saying that these acts of hatred are "harvested" after being "planted". The comments come after two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which left 31 people dead. Trump has denied being a racist and called for condemning racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. However, many critics argue that his rhetoric, including calling immigrants an "invasion", has contributed to the violence. Biden and Booker are among 24 candidates vying to take on Trump in the 2020 election, with most calling for stricter gun laws and action against white supremacy.
