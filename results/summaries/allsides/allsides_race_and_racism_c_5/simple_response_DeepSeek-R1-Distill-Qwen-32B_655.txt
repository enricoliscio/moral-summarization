Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker criticizing Trump's rhetoric regarding white supremacy and mass shootings. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Biden accuses Trump of fueling white supremacy, which led to mass shootings. Booker talks about the roots of these shootings and the need to address them. Trump, on the other hand, claims he's not a racist and focuses on mental health and social media as solutions, avoiding major gun law changes. The article also mentions the two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, with the El Paso shooter having an anti-immigrant manifesto.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements: Biden's accusation, Booker's address, Trump's response, the shootings, and the political implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone, highlighting how Trump's rhetoric is linked to the violence.

I'll start by stating Biden's accusation, then mention Booker's speech. Next, I'll describe the shootings and their connection to Trump's statements. Then, I'll note Trump's approach and the Democrats' calls for stricter gun laws. Finally, I'll conclude with the candidates' focus on addressing hate and division.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all points are covered without exceeding the word limit.
