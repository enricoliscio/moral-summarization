Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the issue of white supremacy and gun violence, particularly in the context of recent mass shootings. They're criticizing Trump's rhetoric as fueling these issues. I should highlight their accusations against Trump, mentioning specific examples like the El Paso shooting and the manifesto.

I also need to include Trump's response, where he condemns racism but doesn't address gun laws. Biden and Booker's stances on stricter gun laws are important too. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the moral critique without going into too much detail.

I should structure it by first mentioning Biden's accusation, then Booker's speech, followed by Trump's reaction, and conclude with the candidates' positions on gun control. Keeping it clear and to the point while maintaining the moral perspective is key.
