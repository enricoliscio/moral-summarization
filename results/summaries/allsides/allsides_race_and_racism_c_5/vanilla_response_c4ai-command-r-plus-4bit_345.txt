SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs blamed for recent mass shootings in the U.S. Joe Biden, the front-runner, delivered a fiery speech in Iowa, stating that Trump's rhetoric has fanned the flames of racism and division in the nation. Cory Booker, another contender, spoke at the South Carolina church where a white supremacist killed nine people in 2015, emphasizing that acts of hatred are cultivated and enabled. The weekend's mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton intensified criticism of Trump's inflammatory language and hard-line immigration policies. Trump, who visited the affected cities, proposed mental health reforms and social media collaboration to detect potential shooters but fell short of supporting major gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates have called for stricter gun laws, with Booker advocating for firearm licensing. Biden and Booker criticized Trump for aligning himself with forces of racism and division, while Booker shifted the focus to addressing the problem of white supremacy and racism.
