SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Trump of promoting white supremacy and divisive rhetoric that fuels mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden delivered a fiery speech in Iowa, blaming Trump's language for inciting hatred and violence, specifically mentioning Trump's characterization of Central American immigrants as "an invasion." Biden and Senator Cory Booker, another Democratic contender, criticized Trump's response to the recent shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which left 31 people dead. They joined other Democratic candidates in calling for stricter gun laws and addressing the issues of racism and white supremacy. Booker's speech at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, where a previous mass shooting took place, emphasized that acts of hatred are cultivated and cannot be ignored. Trump, who denies accusations of racism, proposed reforms focused on mental health and social media monitoring but fell short of supporting significant gun law changes. The Democratic candidates aim to challenge Trump in the 2020 election, highlighting the urgent need to address the rising tide of hate and division in the country.
