SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused Republican President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, blaming him for several U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and has a "toxic tongue" that has "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Another contender, Cory Booker, also condemned white nationalism and gun violence, emphasizing that these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum, but are "harvested" after being "planted." Trump's visit to the cities where the mass shootings occurred was met with protests, and he proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters, but stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Biden and Booker, among other Democrats, have called for stricter gun laws and condemned Trump's rhetoric, which they believe has contributed to the rise of white supremacy and hate crimes.
