SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runners Joe Biden and Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which they blame for recent mass shootings in the US. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have been a catalyst for hate crimes. Booker echoed this sentiment, saying that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a culture of hate. The criticism comes after two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which left 31 people dead. Trump has denied being a racist and called for condemnation of racism, bigotry, and white supremacy, but his opponents argue that his words and actions have emboldened white nationalists. The debate highlights the need for stricter gun laws and a reckoning with the nation's dark forces of hate and division. END OF SUMMARY.
