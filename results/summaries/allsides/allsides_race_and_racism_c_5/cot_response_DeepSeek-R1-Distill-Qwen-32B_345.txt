Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task involves two main steps: first, identifying all the single words with moral framing from a given news article, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing President Trump's rhetoric in the context of recent mass shootings. The key moral issues here are white supremacy, racism, gun violence, and the impact of political language on such events.

For the first step, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "accused," "fueled," "white supremacy," "mass shootings," "fanned," "flames," "harvested," "planted," "incendiary," "condemn," "hatred," "anti-immigrant," "invasion," "toxic," "hate," "division," "opposed," "darkness," "racism," "address," and "problem." These words are charged with moral judgment, so I'll list them each with a bullet.

Next, the summary needs to encapsulate the main points while retaining these moral terms. I should mention Biden and Booker's accusations against Trump, the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump's response, and the candidates' calls for stricter gun laws. It's important to highlight the moral framing, so I'll use terms like "fueled," "white supremacy," "incendiary rhetoric," and "condemn."

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally. I'll start by stating Biden's accusation, then Booker's speech, followed by the details of the shootings and Trump's reaction. Finally, I'll note the candidates' positions on gun laws and the moral implications of Trump's rhetoric.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and to the point, making sure it reflects the moral framing as per the original article. Let me put it all together, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**  
Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy, linking it to recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Biden and Cory Booker highlighted the president's incendiary rhetoric, with Booker emphasizing the need to address racism rather than debating whether Trump is a racist. Trump, who denied being racist, called for mental health reforms and tighter gun control but stopped short of major legislative changes. The shootings, driven by hatred for Hispanics and others, intensified criticism of Trump's hard-line immigration policies and his use of terms like "invasion." Biden and Booker, among other Democrats, called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and bans on assault weapons. Biden criticized Trump's toxic rhetoric and alignment with hate, while Booker focused on taking action against racism and white supremacy. The moral framing centered on Trump's role in exacerbating division and hatred, with Democrats advocating for unity and reform.
