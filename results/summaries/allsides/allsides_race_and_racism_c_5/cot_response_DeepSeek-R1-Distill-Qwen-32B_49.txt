Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Joe Biden and Cory Booker's responses to Trump's rhetoric in the context of recent mass shootings. 

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words. The user wants me to list each word with an asterisk. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "fueled," "white supremacy," "condemn," "incendiary," "racist," "hatred," "bigotry," "invasion," "darkness," "toxic," "hate," "racism," and "division" stand out as they relate to moral issues.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Biden and Booker's accusations against Trump, the mass shootings, Trump's response, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Biden's accusation, moving to the shootings, Trump's rhetoric, and the candidates' stances. I'll also mention the protesters and the Democrats' calls for stricter gun laws. 

I need to be careful not to add any personal opinions, just stick to the facts while keeping the moral language intact. Let me structure it step by step to cover all key points succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy and hate, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings. Biden criticized Trump for using "clear language and code" to promote white supremacy, while Booker emphasized the roots of hatred and racism. The weekend's shootings in El Paso and Dayton, driven by anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant hatred, intensified scrutiny of Trump's incendiary statements, such as calling Central Americans an "invasion." Trump denied responsibility, calling for mental health reforms and curbing access to guns for violent individuals, but stopped short of supporting major gun law changes. Protesters greeted Trump during his visits to El Paso and Dayton. Biden and Booker, among 24 Democratic candidates, called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and bans on assault-style weapons. Biden condemned Trump's toxic rhetoric and alignment with "the darkest forces," while Booker focused on addressing racism and white supremacy rather than assigning blame.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
