SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused Republican President Donald Trump of encouraging white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker delivered speeches criticizing Trump's rhetoric and its potential influence on the shooters. The El Paso shooting, in particular, has been linked to anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by Trump's characterization of Central American migrants as "an invasion." Trump has denied any responsibility for the shootings and instead proposed reforms focusing on mental health and social media monitoring. The Democratic candidates, including Biden and Booker, have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the issues of racism and white supremacy as key factors in the recent tragedies. They argue that Trump's language and policies have contributed to a toxic environment that enables acts of hatred and violence. Biden and Booker emphasize the urgent need to address these issues and take action against racism and gun violence in the United States.
