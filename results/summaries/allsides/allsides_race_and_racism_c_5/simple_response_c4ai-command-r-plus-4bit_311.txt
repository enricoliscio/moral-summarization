SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Donald Trump of promoting white supremacy and contributing to the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. In a speech, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that Trump's rhetoric has fueled hatred and division in the country, aligning himself with "the darkest forces in the nation." Senator Cory Booker, speaking at the church where a white supremacist killed nine people in 2015, argued that acts of hatred are harvested from seeds that have been planted. Both Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic contenders, have called for stricter gun laws and rejected Trump's divisive language. They believe his words and actions have exposed him to condemnation for promoting racist and anti-immigrant sentiments. Trump's aides have denied any connection between his rhetoric and the shootings, but critics argue that his inflammatory language and policies have created an environment where such violence can thrive. Biden and Booker, among other candidates, aim to address the issues of racism, white supremacy, and gun violence head-on as they seek to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
