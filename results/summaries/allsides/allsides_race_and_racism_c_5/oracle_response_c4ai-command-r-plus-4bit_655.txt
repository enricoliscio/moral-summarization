SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that are blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker delivered speeches criticizing Trump's rhetoric and its potential influence on the shooters. The El Paso shooting, in particular, has been linked to anti-immigrant hatred, with the shooter's manifesto referring to a "Hispanic invasion of Texas." Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the issues of racism and white supremacy. They argue that Trump's language and policies have exposed him to condemnation and that his response to the shootings fell short of addressing the root causes. In contrast, Trump and his aides have denied any connection between his rhetoric and the shootings, focusing instead on mental health and social media as potential factors. The back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which took the lives of 31 people, have intensified the debate around gun control, racism, and the role of political rhetoric in inciting violence.
