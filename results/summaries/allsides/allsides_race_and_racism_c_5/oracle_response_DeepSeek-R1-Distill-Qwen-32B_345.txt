Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about Joe Biden and Cory Booker accusing Trump of fueling white supremacy, leading to mass shootings. The morally charged words include "shootings," "killed," "rampages," "fanned," "supremacy," etc. I need to make sure these terms are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key events: the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump's response, and the Democratic candidates' criticisms. The moral framing is about how Trump's rhetoric contributes to hate and division.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Biden and Booker's accusations, the details of the shootings, Trump's stance, and the proposed solutions by Democrats. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the morally framed words are included.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary elements and maintain the moral perspective. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Democratic front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings that killed 31 people. Biden criticized Trump for using "clear language and code" to "fawn the flames of white supremacy," while Trump denied racism and called for unity. In El Paso, a gunman killed 22, driven by anti-Hispanic hatred, and in Dayton, nine were killed, including the shooter's sister. Biden highlighted Trump's "toxic tongue" and alignment with "dark forces," while Trump proposed mental health reforms and curbing gun access for violent individuals. Cory Booker focused on addressing racism and white nationalism, emphasizing action over blame. Democrats, including Biden and Booker, advocate for stricter gun laws, universal background checks, and banning assault weapons. Trump's visit to the affected cities drew protests, as the nation grapples with hate, division, and the consequences of inflammatory rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
