SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacist beliefs that have been blamed for several mass shootings in the U.S. Biden and other Democrats criticized Trump's rhetoric, saying it was incendiary and racist. They pointed to the president's hard-line immigration policies and his labeling of Central American migrants as "an invasion," which echoed the anti-immigrant hatred in the El Paso shooter's manifesto. Trump's aides denied his rhetoric played a role in the shootings. In the wake of the tragedies, Trump proposed mental health law reforms and enhanced social media monitoring to detect potential shooters, but fell short of endorsing stricter gun law reforms. Meanwhile, Democratic contenders for the presidential nomination, including Biden and Cory Booker, highlighted the issues of white nationalism and gun violence. Booker rejected the debate over Trump's racism, asserting that the real question is who is taking action to address racism and white supremacy. Biden condemned Trump for aligning himself with the darkest forces and embracing hate and division. The back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton intensified criticism of Trump's rhetoric and exposed him to renewed condemnation.
END OF SUMMARY.
