SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have led to several U.S. mass shootings, including the recent ones in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Another Democratic contender, Cory Booker, also condemned white nationalism and gun violence, emphasizing that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the problem. Trump, who has denied being a racist, proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters, but stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Biden and Booker, along with most Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. The debate has highlighted the need to address racism, bigotry, and white supremacy in the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
