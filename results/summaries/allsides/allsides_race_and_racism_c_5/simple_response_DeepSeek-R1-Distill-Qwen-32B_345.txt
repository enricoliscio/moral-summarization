Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. They're criticizing Trump for fueling white supremacy and hate through his rhetoric. Trump, on the other hand, is denying any connection and instead focusing on mental health and social media as causes. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments made by Biden and Booker. They're linking Trump's statements to the shootings, suggesting his words have emboldened racists. Also, the article mentions the political implications, like Trump's visit to the affected cities and the Democrats' calls for stricter gun laws.

I should structure the summary to highlight the accusations against Trump, the context of the shootings, and the differing responses from Biden, Booker, and Trump himself. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but include all key points.

Let me outline the main points:
1. Biden accuses Trump of promoting white supremacy through his rhetoric.
2. Booker addresses the same issues, focusing on the roots of hate.
3. Trump's response includes denying racism and proposing policy changes without gun law reform.
4. The shootings are linked to anti-immigrant and white supremacist ideologies.
5. The political stakes, with Democrats pushing for stricter gun laws.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include these points while maintaining the moral framing against Trump's rhetoric and the implications for the 2020 election.

SUMMARY: Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for allegedly fueling white supremacy and hate, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Biden accused Trump of embracing a "political strategy of hate, racism, and division," while Booker focused on addressing systemic issues rather than debating Trump's racism. Trump, who denies racism, proposed mental health reforms and social media monitoring but avoided major gun law changes. The shootings, driven by anti-immigrant and white supremacist ideologies, have intensified scrutiny of Trump's immigration policies and rhetoric. Democrats, including Biden and Booker, are advocating for stricter gun laws. The political stakes are high as the 2020 election approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
