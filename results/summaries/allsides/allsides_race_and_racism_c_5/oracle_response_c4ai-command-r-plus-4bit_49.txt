SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that are blamed for the recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden delivered a fiery speech in Iowa, claiming that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" through his rhetoric and policies. Senator Cory Booker also addressed the issues of white nationalism and gun violence during a speech at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where a deadly shooting took place in 2015. The weekend's mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have intensified criticism of Trump's incendiary language and hard-line immigration stance. While Trump has condemned racism and proposed some measures to address gun violence, he has fallen short of calling for significant gun law reforms. Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic candidates, have advocated for stricter gun laws and addressed the urgent need to address racism and white supremacy in the nation. They believe that Trump's alignment with these forces and his embrace of divisive rhetoric pose a grave threat to the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
