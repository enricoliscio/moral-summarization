Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the recent mass shootings, linking them to Trump's rhetoric. The main moral issues here are racism, white supremacy, gun violence, and the impact of political speech on societal actions.

I notice the author uses words like "shootings," "killed," "rampages," "fanned," "supremacy," "shot," "dead," "hatred," "racism," "bigotry," "invasion," "attack," "checks," "banning," "requiring," "opposed," "aligned," "embraced," "hate," and "division." These words carry strong moral connotations, so I need to include them in the summary.

Biden accuses Trump of fueling white supremacy through his language, pointing out the El Paso shooter's manifesto as evidence. Booker focuses on addressing the problem rather than blaming individuals. Trump's response includes proposals on mental health and social media but avoids major gun law changes. The summary should highlight these points, using the moral terms to convey the severity of the issues.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed words as possible. I'll structure it to cover Biden's accusations, Booker's stance, Trump's response, and the candidates' differing approaches on gun control and rhetoric.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral words and the main arguments from each candidate. I'll keep it clear and to the point, ensuring all critical points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Cory Booker have criticized President Donald Trump for allegedly fueling white supremacy and hatred, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings. Biden accused Trump of "fanning the flames" of white supremacy, citing the president's use of inflammatory language, such as calling immigration an "invasion." Trump visited El Paso and Dayton after the shootings, where he proposed mental health reforms and curbing gun access for violent individuals but avoided major gun law changes. Booker, speaking at a historically black church, emphasized the need to address racism and white supremacy rather than debating whether Trump is a racist. Both Biden and Booker condemned Trump's "toxic" rhetoric and his alignment with "dark forces" of hate and division. The candidates also called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. Trump's administration has faced criticism for its hard-line immigration policies and rhetoric, which some argue contributed to the shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
