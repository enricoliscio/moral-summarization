SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that are blamed for recent mass shootings in the U.S., which have intensified criticism of Trump's incendiary rhetoric. Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a fiery speech, said that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his hard-line immigration policies and rhetoric have exposed him to renewed condemnation. Senator Cory Booker, speaking at the church where a white supremacist shooting took place in 2015, emphasized that acts of hatred are planted and harvested. Both Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws and rejected Trump's divisive language and policies. They argue that Trump has aligned himself with dark forces and embraced a strategy of hate, racism, and division. While Trump has denied being a racist and proposed some reforms to address gun violence, his aides deny any connection between his rhetoric and the shootings.
