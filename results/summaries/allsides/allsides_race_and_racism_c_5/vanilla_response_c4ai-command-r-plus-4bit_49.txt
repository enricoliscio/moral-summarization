SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have criticized President Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies, accusing him of fueling white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker delivered speeches addressing the issue and calling out Trump's divisive language. Biden asserted that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy," while Booker emphasized that acts of hatred are the result of underlying ideologies. The El Paso shooting, driven by hatred for Hispanics, has drawn attention to Trump's hard-line immigration policies and inflammatory language. Trump has denied any responsibility for the shootings and proposed limited gun law reforms. Most Democratic candidates have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the issues of white nationalism and gun violence. Biden and Booker's speeches highlight their concerns over Trump's alignment with divisive forces and their commitment to addressing racism and white supremacy.
