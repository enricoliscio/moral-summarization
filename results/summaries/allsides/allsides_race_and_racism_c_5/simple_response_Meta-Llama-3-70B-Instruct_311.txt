SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runners Joe Biden and Cory Booker have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which they blame for recent mass shootings in the US. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and that his words have led to violent acts. Booker emphasized that these acts of hatred do not occur in a vacuum, but are rather harvested from the seeds of racism and white nationalism. Trump, who has denied being a racist, has proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect potential mass shooters, but has stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Biden and Booker, along with most Democratic candidates, are advocating for stricter gun laws and condemning Trump's rhetoric as incendiary and divisive. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Trump's words and actions are being seen as perpetuating racism and white supremacy, and it is the responsibility of leaders to condemn and address these evils.
