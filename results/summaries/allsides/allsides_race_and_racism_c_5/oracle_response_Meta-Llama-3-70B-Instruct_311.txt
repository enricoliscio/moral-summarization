SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused Republican President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs blamed for several U.S. mass shootings, including the recent El Paso and Dayton rampages that killed 31 people. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and "embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Another contender, Cory Booker, echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that Trump's words have "harvested" hatred. Trump's response to the shootings was criticized for not addressing the root causes, instead proposing reforms to mental health laws and social media detection. Biden and Booker, along with other Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. The candidates emphasized the need to "oppose hate" and address the problem of racism and white supremacy. END OF SUMMARY.
