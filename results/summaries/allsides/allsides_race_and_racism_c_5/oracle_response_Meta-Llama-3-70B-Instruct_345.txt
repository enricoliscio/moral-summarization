SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have led to several U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump's rhetoric has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and has "aligned himself with the darkest forces in the nation." Trump's visit to the cities where 31 people were killed in rampages last weekend sparked criticism of his incendiary rhetoric. Biden and fellow Democratic contender Cory Booker emphasized the need to address white nationalism and gun violence, with Booker saying that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that they are "harvested only once they have been planted." Trump's aides deny that his rhetoric was a cause of the shootings, but many Democrats have called for stricter gun laws, including universal background checks and banning assault-style weapons. Biden and Booker urged action against racism, bigotry, and white supremacy, with Booker saying that what matters is not who is or isn't a racist, but who is and isn't doing something about it.
