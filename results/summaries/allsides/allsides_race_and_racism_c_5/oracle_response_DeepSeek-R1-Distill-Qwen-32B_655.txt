Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should make sure to include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing mass shootings and their accusations against Trump's rhetoric. Trump is accused of fueling white supremacy and racism, which led to the shootings. The shootings in El Paso and Dayton are highlighted, with the El Paso shooter targeting Hispanics. Trump's response includes proposing mental health reforms and working with social media but not supporting major gun law changes. Biden and Booker are pushing for stricter gun laws. 

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words: shootings, killed, rampages, fanned, supremacy, shot, dead, hatred, racism, bigotry, shooting, invasion, attack, short, checks, banning, requiring, opposed, aligned, embraced, hate, division.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start with Biden's accusation, mention the shootings and Trump's visit. Then include Booker's speech and the context of the church. Highlight the weekend's events and the criticism of Trump's rhetoric. Mention the specific shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the motivations, and Trump's response. Finally, note Biden and Booker's calls for stricter gun laws and their criticism of Trump's alignment with hate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be selective but include as many moral words as possible. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate terminology.

SUMMARY:  
Democratic front-runner Joe Biden accused President Trump of fueling white supremacy, linking his rhetoric to recent mass shootings. In El Paso, a gunman killed 22 people driven by anti-Hispanic hatred, while in Dayton, nine were shot dead. Biden criticized Trump's "toxic" language, comparing it to the shooter's "invasion" rhetoric. Trump denied responsibility, proposing mental health reforms and social media monitoring but avoiding major gun law changes. Cory Booker, another Democratic candidate, focused on addressing racism and gun violence, rejecting debates over Trump's racism. Biden and Booker called for stricter gun laws, including background checks and bans on assault weapons. Both candidates condemned Trump's "division" and "hate" tactics, emphasizing action over blame.  
END OF SUMMARY.
