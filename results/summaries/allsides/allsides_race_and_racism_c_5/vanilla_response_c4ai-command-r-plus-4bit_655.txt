SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the United States. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Cory Booker delivered speeches condemning Trump's rhetoric and its role in inciting hatred and violence. Biden criticized Trump for using inflammatory language and aligning himself with "the darkest forces in the nation." Booker emphasized that acts of hatred are not committed in a vacuum and that addressing racism and white supremacy is crucial. Trump has faced renewed condemnation for his rhetoric and immigration policies, with critics pointing out similarities between his language and the manifesto of the El Paso shooter. Trump visited El Paso and Dayton, the sites of the recent shootings, and proposed reforms focusing on mental health and social media detection, but fell short of advocating for major gun law changes. Biden and Booker are among the 24 candidates vying for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, with most calling for stricter gun control measures.
