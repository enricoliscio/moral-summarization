Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing the recent mass shootings and their accusations against Trump's rhetoric. 

First, Biden is calling out Trump for fueling white supremacy, especially after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton. He mentions that Trump's language has contributed to the problem. Then, Booker talks about the roots of these shootings, emphasizing that they don't happen in a vacuum. 

The article also details the two mass shootings: El Paso targeting Hispanics and Dayton, where the shooter killed his sister and others. Trump visited both cities and faced protesters. He proposed some measures like mental health reform and working with social media but didn't call for major gun law changes. 

Biden and Booker are part of the Democratic race, and most candidates are pushing for stricter gun laws. Trump's team denies his rhetoric caused the shootings. 

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Biden and Booker's accusations, the shootings, Trump's response, and the political implications. Make sure to include the main actors, their statements, and the context of the shootings. Also, mention the proposed solutions and the candidates' positions on gun control.

Let me structure this: start with Biden and Booker's accusations, then describe the shootings, Trump's response, his visit, and the proposed measures. Finally, note the candidates' positions on gun laws and the political debate.

I should keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Make sure the flow is logical, moving from the accusations to the events, then Trump's actions, and finally the political landscape.
