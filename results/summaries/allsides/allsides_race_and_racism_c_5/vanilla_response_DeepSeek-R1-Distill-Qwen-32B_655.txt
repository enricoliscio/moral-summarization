Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Joe Biden and Cory Booker addressing mass shootings and their criticism of Trump's rhetoric. 

Biden accuses Trump of fueling white supremacy, especially after the shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Trump, on the other hand, says he condemns racism and proposed some measures but didn't push for major gun law changes. Booker focused on addressing white nationalism and gun violence, emphasizing action over who is racist.

I should include the key points: Biden's accusation, Trump's response, the shootings' details, Booker's speech, and the broader context of the Democratic candidates' positions on gun control. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main issues without too much detail. 

Let me structure it: start with Biden's accusation, mention the shootings, Trump's reaction, Booker's stance, and the candidates' gun control proposals. Make sure to include the locations and the number of casualties. Also, note the contrast between Trump's rhetoric and the candidates' calls for stricter laws.

I need to ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding any markdown. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, covering all essential aspects without getting bogged down in specifics.
