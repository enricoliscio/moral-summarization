SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling the flames of white supremacy and blamed him for the recent mass shootings in the U.S. Biden and other Democratic contenders, including Cory Booker, criticized Trump's hateful and divisive rhetoric, including his labeling of Central American immigrants as "an invasion." They argued that Trump's toxic language and alignment with the darkest forces of racism and white supremacy have contributed to the increasing acts of hatred and violence. Trump, who has denied being a racist, proposed reforms focusing on mental health and social media detection while stopping short of addressing gun law reforms. Meanwhile, Biden and Booker, among other Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the urgent need to confront racism and white supremacy head-on. Booker emphasized that the real question is not who is racist but who is taking action against these toxic forces. Biden and Booker's moral stance against Trump's rhetoric and policies highlights their commitment to combating hate, racism, and division in the nation.
