SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Donald Trump of promoting white supremacy beliefs that are blamed for the recent mass shootings in the U.S., which killed 31 people. Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a speech in Iowa, criticized Trump for using "clear language and code" to fan the flames of white supremacy and incite hatred and division. Senator Cory Booker, in a speech at the historically black church in Charleston where a white supremacist shooting took place in 2015, emphasized that acts of hatred are the result of underlying causes. Both Biden and Booker highlighted Trump's rhetoric, such as calling Central American immigrants "an invasion," as contributing to the toxic environment that led to the El Paso shooting. They, along with other Democratic candidates, have called for stricter gun laws and addressed the urgent need to combat racism and white supremacy. While Trump has denied accusations of being racist, he proposed reforms to address gun violence and condemned racism and white supremacy in a national address. However, critics argue that his rhetoric and policies have exposed him to renewed condemnation following the tragic shootings.
