SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have been blamed for several U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" with his rhetoric, including calling Central Americans trying to enter the United States "an invasion." Trump's aides deny that his rhetoric was a cause of the shootings. Biden and other Democratic contenders, such as Cory Booker, have called for stricter gun laws and condemned Trump's "toxic tongue" and "strategy of hate, racism, and division." Booker emphasized that what matters is not whether Trump is a racist, but who is doing something to address the problem of racism and white supremacy. The debate comes after two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, which left 31 people dead. END OF SUMMARY.
