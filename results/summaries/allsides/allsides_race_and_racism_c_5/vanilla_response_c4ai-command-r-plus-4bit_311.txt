SUMMARY: Several Democratic presidential candidates have criticized President Trump for his rhetoric on immigration and its role in fueling white supremacy beliefs that have been blamed for recent mass shootings in the U.S. Joe Biden and Cory Booker, two of the Democratic contenders, gave speeches addressing the issue. Biden accused Trump of "fanning the flames of white supremacy" and condemned his use of inflammatory language, such as referring to Central American migrants as "an invasion." Booker, speaking at the church where a white supremacist shooting took place in 2015, emphasized that acts of hatred are cultivated and not spontaneous. Both candidates, along with many others in the Democratic field, have called for stricter gun control measures to address the issue of gun violence in the country. Trump, who visited El Paso and Dayton, faced protests and criticism for his response to the shootings, with many believing his rhetoric has contributed to the rise in white supremacist beliefs. Trump's aides deny any connection between his rhetoric and the shootings, and the president has proposed reforms focused on mental health and social media detection of potential shooters.
