SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused Republican President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs, which have been blamed for several U.S. mass shootings. Biden stated that Trump has "fanned the flames of white supremacy" and has a "toxic tongue" that has "publicly and unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division." Another contender, Cory Booker, emphasized that "these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum" and that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the problem. Trump's aides deny any connection between his rhetoric and the shootings. The president proposed reforming mental health laws and working with social media to detect possible mass shooters, but stopped short of calling for major gun law reforms. Biden and Booker are among 24 candidates vying to take on Trump in the November 2020 election, with most Democrats calling for stricter gun laws. END OF SUMMARY.
