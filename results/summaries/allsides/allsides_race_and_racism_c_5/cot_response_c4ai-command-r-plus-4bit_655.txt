SUMMARY: Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacy beliefs blamed for recent mass shootings in the U.S. Biden and other Democratic contenders for the presidential nomination, such as Cory Booker, have criticized Trump's rhetoric and policies, arguing that they contribute to a culture of hatred and division. Trump's language, including referring to Central American immigrants as "an invasion," has been linked to the El Paso shooter's anti-immigrant manifesto. Biden and Booker highlighted the need to address racism and white supremacy, with Biden condemning Trump for aligning himself with "the darkest forces in the nation." In response to the shootings, Trump proposed mental health reforms and social media collaboration to identify potential shooters but fell short of supporting significant gun law changes. Biden and Booker, among other Democratic candidates, advocate for stricter gun laws and addressing the root causes of hatred to prevent future tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
