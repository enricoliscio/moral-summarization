SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the organization and avoiding business with it. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justified the designation, stating that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives." The resolution highlights the alarming statistic that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on the organization and its members. This move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level.
