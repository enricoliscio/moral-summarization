SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading "propaganda" that "misinforms and aims to deceive the public" about the dangers of gun violence. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, condemned the NRA as "absolutely disgraceful" for standing in the way of saving lives through its opposition to gun control. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and avoid doing business with the organization. The NRA has condemned the resolution as a "reckless assault" on its members and the freedoms they stand for. The move comes amidst growing national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
