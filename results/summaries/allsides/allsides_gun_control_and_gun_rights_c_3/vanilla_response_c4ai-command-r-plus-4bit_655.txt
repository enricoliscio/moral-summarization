SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA to an epidemic of gun violence in the US and urges the city to distance itself from the organization by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the NRA. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, stated that the designation is justified because the NRA's opposition to gun control is costing lives. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA condemned the move as a reckless assault on law-abiding citizens. This comes amid increased national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has faced pressure to take up gun control legislation, but has maintained that President Trump should support it first.
END OF SUMMARY.
