SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA to an "epidemic of gun violence" in the U.S. and urges San Francisco to distance itself from the organization. The NRA is accused of spreading "propaganda" that "misinforms" and "aims to deceive" the public about the dangers of gun violence. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, calls the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and says its opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives.‚Äù The resolution notes that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S.'s gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other "high-income" country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy'" to the violence epidemic. END OF SUMMARY.
