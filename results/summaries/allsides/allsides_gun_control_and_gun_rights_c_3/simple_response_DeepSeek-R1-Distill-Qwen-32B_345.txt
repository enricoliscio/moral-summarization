Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, the article is pretty detailed, so I need to make sure I capture the key points without losing the essence.

First, I should identify the main points. The resolution was passed unanimously, calling the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. They linked the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution urges San Francisco to examine ties with the NRA and avoid business with them. The reasoning is that the NRA spreads misinformation and stands in the way of saving lives. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored it, and she called the NRA absolutely disgraceful.

Then, the NRA responded, calling the resolution a worthless soundbite and an assault on their freedoms. They mentioned Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo as another example of their opposition. There have been recent mass shootings, and the issue is getting more attention, especially with Senate Majority Leader McConnell under pressure but not taking action yet.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include the resolution's main actions, the reasoning behind it, the reaction from the NRA, and the context of recent events. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”so highlighting the stance against the NRA and the push for gun control measures.

I should structure the summary to start with the resolution, then the reasoning, the reaction, and the broader context. Make sure it's clear and flows well. I need to avoid any markdown and just write a plain summary. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the "epidemic of gun violence" in the U.S. The resolution calls for San Francisco to sever ties with the NRA, avoid business with it, and examine local vendors' and contractors' connections to the group. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, criticized the NRA for spreading misinformation and obstructing gun control measures, stating it is "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution highlights that 100 Americans die daily from gun violence, with the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on its freedoms and values. This move follows recent mass shootings and national attention on gun violence, as well as the NRA's criticism of Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammunition. The resolution aims to set a precedent for similar legislation at higher levels of government. END OF SUMMARY.
