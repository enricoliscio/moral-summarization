SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution condemns the NRA for spreading "propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence," thereby standing in the way of "saving lives." The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA and avoid doing business with the organization or its affiliates. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justified the designation, citing the NRA's opposition to gun control as "absolutely disgraceful" and a hindrance to addressing the daily toll of 100 Americans killed by gun violence. The NRA has condemned the resolution as a "reckless assault" on its members and freedoms. The move comes amid growing national attention to gun violence following recent mass shootings.
