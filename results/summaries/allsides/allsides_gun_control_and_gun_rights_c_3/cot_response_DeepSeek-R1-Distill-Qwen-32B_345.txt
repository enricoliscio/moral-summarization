Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with the San Francisco Board of Supervisors declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." That's a strong term, so "terrorist" is definitely morally framed. They mention the "epidemic of gun violence," so "epidemic" and "violence" are moral terms. The resolution urges distancing from the NRA, so "distance" and "examine" are part of the action but not necessarily moral. 

The resolution says the NRA spreads "propaganda" that "misinforms" and "deceives" the public about "dangers of gun violence." So "propaganda," "misinforms," "deceives," and "dangers" are all morally charged. Supervisor Stefani calls the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and "out for what they really are," so "disgraceful" is another moral word.

The resolution mentions 100 Americans killed daily, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. "Killed," "daily," "homicide," and "higher" are factual but "killed" has a moral connotation. 

The NRA condemns the resolution as a "worthless" and "disgusting" "soundbite remedy." So "worthless," "disgusting," and "remedy" are moral terms. They also call it a "reckless assault" on their freedoms, so "reckless" and "assault" are moral. 

The NRA says Walmart's decision to stop selling ammo would "hurt business" and "not make us any safer." "Hurt" and "safer" are moral. Recent mass shootings in California, Ohio, and Texas have brought attention to gun violence. "Mass shootings" and "attention" are part of the context but "violence" again. Senate Majority Leader McConnell is under pressure for gun control legislation, which is a moral issue. Trump's discussions with the NRA head on background checks are mentioned, highlighting the political stance.

So, compiling all the morally framed words: terrorist, epidemic, violence, misinforms, deceives, dangers, disgraceful, worthless, disgusting, reckless, assault, hurt, safer, violence, legislation, stance.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating the resolution, mention the moral terms like declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization, link it to the epidemic of gun violence. Highlight that the resolution urges distancing and examines ties, accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda, misinforming, and deceiving. Include Stefani's description as disgraceful. Mention the statistics on daily killings and higher homicide rate. Note the NRA's condemnation as worthless and disgusting, their belief it's a reckless assault on freedoms. Also, mention the recent shootings and the political pressure on McConnell and Trump. Keep it under 200 words.

Let me structure this: Start with the resolution, the declaration, the reasons (epidemic, violence), the actions taken (distance, examine ties), the accusations against the NRA (propaganda, misinform, deceive), Stefani's comments, the statistics, NRA's response, recent events, and the political context. Make sure to include all the key moral terms without making it too long.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
