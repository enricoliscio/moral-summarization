Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral stance presented.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They link the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining vendors' and contractors' ties. It also mentions the NRA spreading propaganda that misleads the public about gun violence dangers. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored the resolution, calling the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and opposing gun control as standing in the way of saving lives. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA responded by condemning it as a "soundbite remedy," accusing it of being a reckless assault on their freedoms. Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun control, with McConnell under pressure but waiting for Trump's support.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing intact. The article portrays the NRA negatively, associating them with gun violence and misinformation. The resolution is presented as a necessary step to protect public safety, while the NRA's response is defensive, arguing against the characterization.

I should structure the summary to include the resolution's declaration, the reasons given (propaganda, hindering gun control), the call to action by the city, the NRA's response, and the broader context of recent shootings and political inaction.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without losing the moral perspective. I'll start by stating the resolution, then the reasons, the call to action, the NRA's condemnation, and the context of recent events and political implications.

Let me draft it step by step:

1. San Francisco declares NRA a domestic terrorist organization.
2. Reason: NRA's role in gun violence epidemic, spreading misinformation.
3. Call to examine ties and avoid business with NRA.
4. Supervisor Stefani's justification: NRA's opposition to gun control is blocking life-saving measures.
5. Resolution passed unanimously.
6. NRA condemns the move as a worthless attempt, attacking their freedoms.
7. Recent shootings and political pressure on McConnell and Trump.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the U.S. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda that misleads the public about gun violence dangers and urges the city to sever ties with the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and argued its opposition to gun control stands in the way of saving lives. The resolution highlights that 100 Americans die daily from gun violence, a rate 25 times higher than in other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy,'" accusing it of attacking their freedoms. This move comes amid national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell facing pressure to address gun control but delaying action until President Trump supports legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
