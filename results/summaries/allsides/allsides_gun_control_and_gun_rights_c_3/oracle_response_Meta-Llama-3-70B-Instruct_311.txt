SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution, passed unanimously, urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the organization. The NRA is accused of spreading "propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence." Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justified the designation, saying the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives.‚Äù The resolution highlights the devastating impact of gun violence, with 100 Americans killed daily, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other "high-income" country. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on a law-abiding organization.
