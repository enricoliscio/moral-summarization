SUMMARY: In a unanimous vote, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in spreading misinformation and obstructing gun control efforts, contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, emphasizes that the NRA's stance is hindering progress in reducing gun-related deaths and deserves to be labeled as such. The resolution calls for San Francisco to cut ties with the NRA and encourages similar actions at other levels of government. The NRA, in response, dismissed the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy,'" claiming that it is an attack on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This incident reflects the growing pressure on the NRA and the urgency to address gun violence following recent mass shootings across the country.

END OF SUMMARY.
