SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in spreading misinformation and deception about gun violence, which has resulted in an epidemic of gun-related deaths and injuries in the United States. It urges the city to distance itself from the NRA and any associated organizations by examining and severing ties with vendors and contractors linked to the group. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, emphasizes that the NRA's opposition to gun control measures is costing lives, and that their reckless and harmful actions justify the designation of a domestic terrorist organization. The resolution also calls attention to the alarming rate of gun homicides in the US, which is 25 times higher than that of any other high-income country. The NRA has responded by dismissing the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting soundbite remedy," but the move by San Francisco supervisors sends a strong message about the organization's role in perpetuating gun violence and endangering lives. It is hoped that this resolution will inspire similar actions at other levels of government to address the issue of gun violence and hold the NRA accountable for its harmful influence.
END OF SUMMARY.
