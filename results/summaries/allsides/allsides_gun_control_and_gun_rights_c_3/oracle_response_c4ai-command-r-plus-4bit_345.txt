SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in spreading misinformation and deceit about the dangers of gun violence, which has resulted in an epidemic of gun violence in the United States, with 100 Americans killed daily and a gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, emphasizes that the NRA's opposition to gun control measures is hindering efforts to save lives and reduce the violence that is gripping the nation. The resolution calls for San Francisco to examine and cut ties with vendors and contractors associated with the NRA, urging similar actions at the local, state, and federal levels. The NRA has condemned the resolution as a "reckless assault" on their organization and members, denying the accusations and claiming that such actions will not remedy the issue of gun violence. This moral stance against the NRA comes amidst increased national attention on gun violence after recent mass shootings.
END OF SUMMARY.
