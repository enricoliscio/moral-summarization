SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution condemns the NRA for spreading "propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence," and urges the city to distance itself from the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, argues that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives" and that the organization is "absolutely disgraceful" for its role in enabling gun violence. The resolution highlights the alarming fact that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on their organization and its members.
