SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution comes in response to the growing epidemic of gun violence in the United States, which claims the lives of 100 Americans daily. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, argues that the NRA spreads deceptive propaganda that hinders progress on gun control and costs lives. San Francisco plans to distance itself from the NRA by examining and severing ties with vendors and contractors associated with the organization. The resolution also encourages similar actions at other levels of government. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This moral stance taken by San Francisco highlights the ethical imperative to address the devastating impact of gun violence and the need to hold organizations accountable for their role in perpetuating it. END OF SUMMARY.
