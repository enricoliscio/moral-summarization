Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the resolution connects the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. It urges San Francisco to distance itself by examining vendors and contractors tied to the NRA and avoiding business with them. The resolution also states that the NRA spreads misinformation about gun violence dangers.

Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored the resolution and believes the designation is justified because the NRA's opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. She describes the NRA as "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution notes that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries.

The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA responded by condemning it as a "soundbite remedy" and an assault on their freedoms. This is the second high-profile condemnation this week, with Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammunition also drawing their ire.

Recent mass shootings in California, Ohio, and Texas have brought national attention back to gun violence. Senate Majority Leader McConnell is under pressure to address gun control, but he's waiting for Trump's support. Trump discussed gun background checks with NRA head Wayne LaPierre in August.

So, I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the resolution, its reasons, the impact, NRA's response, and the broader context of gun control debates.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the resolution's passage, the reasons behind it, the call for distancing, the statistics, the NRA's opposition, and the national context.

Let me check the word count as I go to make sure I stay within limits. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the U.S. epidemic of gun violence. The resolution calls for the city to sever ties with the NRA, avoid doing business with it, and examine local vendors' and contractors' connections to the group. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justified the designation, stating the NRA's opposition to gun control "stands in the way of saving lives." The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy' to violence," and vowed to continue its work. This move comes amid national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings and debates over gun control legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
