SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution denouncing the National Rifle Association as a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" and misleading the public about the dangers. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, sponsor of the resolution, emphasized that the NRA's opposition to gun control measures is costing lives, with 100 Americans killed daily by gun homicide. The resolution calls for San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and its associates, sending a strong message against an organization that has come under increased scrutiny following recent mass shootings across the country. The NRA, in response, condemned the resolution as a "reckless assault" on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This moral indictment of the NRA reflects a growing sentiment that the organization's influence contributes to a culture of violence and deception, hindering efforts to implement life-saving reforms. The resolution aims to inspire similar actions at other levels of government, signaling a potential shift in the moral discourse surrounding gun control.
END OF SUMMARY.
