SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining ties local vendors and contractors have to the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, stated that the designation is justified due to the NRA's opposition to gun control, which she believes is a contributing factor to the gun violence epidemic in the United States. The resolution passed unanimously and has sparked controversy, with the NRA condemning it as a "reckless assault." Stefani hopes the resolution will pave the way for similar legislation at other levels of government. This comes amid increased national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings and pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to address gun control legislation.

END OF SUMMARY.
