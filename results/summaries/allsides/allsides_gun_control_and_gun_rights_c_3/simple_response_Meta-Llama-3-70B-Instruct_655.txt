SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution condemns the NRA for spreading misinformation and standing in the way of saving lives by opposing gun control measures. It urges the city to distance itself from the organization and avoid doing business with it. The resolution cites the "epidemic of gun violence" in the US, where 100 Americans are killed daily, making the country's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on their organization and its members. This move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level, with the goal of reducing gun violence and saving lives.
