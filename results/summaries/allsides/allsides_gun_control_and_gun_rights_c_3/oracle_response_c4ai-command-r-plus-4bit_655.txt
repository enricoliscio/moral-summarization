SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in spreading misinformation and deception about the dangers of gun violence, which has resulted in an epidemic of gun-related killings and shootings across the United States. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, emphasized that the NRA's opposition to gun control measures is costing lives and that their actions amount to a reckless assault on public safety. The resolution calls for San Francisco to cut ties with the NRA and any associated organizations, sending a strong message to other governments to follow suit. The NRA has responded by condemning the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting" attack on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This moral indictment of the NRA comes amid increased national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings. With pressure mounting on lawmakers to address the issue, the resolution highlights the moral imperative to prioritize saving lives over the interests of the gun lobby.
END OF SUMMARY.
