SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution cites the NRA's role in the "epidemic of gun violence" in the US and encourages the city to cut ties with the organization and its associates. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, stated that the NRA spreads misinformation about gun violence and that its opposition to gun control measures is costing lives. The resolution passed unanimously, despite condemnation from the NRA, which called the move "reckless" and an assault on law-abiding citizens. This comes amidst increased national attention on gun violence after recent mass shootings and pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to address gun control legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
