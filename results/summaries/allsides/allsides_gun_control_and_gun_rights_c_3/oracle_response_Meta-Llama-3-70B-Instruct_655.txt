SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution condemns the NRA for spreading "propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence." By opposing gun control, the NRA is "standing in the way of saving lives," according to Supervisor Catherine Stefani. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and its associated organizations, citing the devastating statistics of 100 Americans killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on their organization and values. This move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level to address the gripping issue of gun violence.
