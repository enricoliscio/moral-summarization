SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association as a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in spreading misinformation about gun violence and obstructing life-saving gun control measures. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, asserts that the NRA's stance on gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives," contributing to an "epidemic of gun violence" that claims 100 American lives daily. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and its affiliates by scrutinizing ties local vendors and contractors have to the organization. Stefani hopes the resolution will inspire similar actions at other governmental levels. The NRA denounced the resolution as a "reckless assault" on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This condemnation comes amidst heightened national attention to gun violence following recent mass shootings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been pressured to address gun control, but he maintains that President Trump should take the lead. The NRA's influence on Trump is evident, as his discussions with NRA head Wayne LaPierre made headlines. This resolution reflects a moral stance against the NRA's harmful rhetoric and its devastating impact on American lives.
END OF SUMMARY.
