SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda that "misinforms and aims to deceive the public" about the dangers of gun violence, thereby standing in the way of "saving lives". The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA and avoid doing business with the organization or its affiliates. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, condemned the NRA as "absolutely disgraceful" for its opposition to gun control, which she believes is responsible for the daily killing of 100 Americans. The resolution highlights the US's gun homicide rate, which is 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution as a "reckless assault" on its members and their freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
