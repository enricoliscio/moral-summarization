SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA to gun violence in the US and urges the city to distance itself from the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, stated that the designation is justified as the NRA's opposition to gun control stands in the way of saving lives. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA condemned it as a reckless assault on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This comes amid increased national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has faced pressure to take up gun control legislation but maintains that President Trump should support it first.

END OF SUMMARY.
