SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a *resolution* that declares the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The *resolution*, which passed unanimously, *connects* the NRA to an "epidemic of gun *violence*" in the U.S. and *urges* the city to *avoid* doing business with the organization. It *spreads propaganda*, *misinforms*, and *deceives* the public about the *dangers* of gun *violence*, according to the *resolution*. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the *resolution*, said that the NRA's *opposition* to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives" and that the *designation* of domestic terrorist organization is *justified*. The NRA *condemned* the *resolution*, calling it a "worthless and *disgusting* '*soundbite remedy*' to the *violence epidemic*." The NRA also said the *resolution* was a "*reckless assault* on a *law-abiding* organization" and that they remain "*undeterred* and *guided* by our values and *belief* in those who want real *solutions* to gun *violence*."
END OF SUMMARY.
