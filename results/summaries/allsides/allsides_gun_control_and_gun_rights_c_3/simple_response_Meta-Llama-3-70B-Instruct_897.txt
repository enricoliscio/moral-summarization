SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution, passed unanimously, urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the organization and avoiding business with them. The NRA's opposition to gun control is seen as "standing in the way of saving lives," and its propaganda is deemed "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution highlights the staggering statistic that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on a law-abiding organization. This move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level.
