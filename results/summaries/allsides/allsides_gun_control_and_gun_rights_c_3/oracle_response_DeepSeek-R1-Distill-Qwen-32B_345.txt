Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the NRA as a domestic terrorist organization. They connected the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the US. The resolution urges the city to distance itself from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties. It also says the government should avoid doing business with the NRA or its affiliates. The resolution mentions that the NRA spreads propaganda to misinform the public about gun violence dangers. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored it and said the designation is justified because the NRA's opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. The resolution notes that 100 Americans die daily from gun violence, making the US's rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA condemned it, calling it a worthless soundbite remedy and an assault on their freedoms. They remain undeterred and believe in real solutions. This is the second condemnation this week; earlier, they criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo. Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun violence, with McConnell under pressure but waiting for Trump's support. Trump discussed background checks with NRA head LaPierre, which was newsworthy.

Now, I need to create a summary using the morally framed words: violence, misinforms, deceive, control, saving, killed, homicide, die, shooting, remedy, gripping, assault, shootings.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: resolution passed, NRA labeled as terrorist, reasons (gun violence, misinforming, deceiving), consequences (avoid business), statistics, NRA's response, recent shootings, and political context.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it forced.

Let me draft it:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda to misinform and deceive the public about gun dangers, urging the city to sever ties with the organization and avoid business dealings. Supervisor Catherine Stefani justified the move, stating the NRA's opposition to gun control stands in the way of saving lives. The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, a rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution as a worthless "soundbite remedy," calling it a reckless assault on their freedoms. This follows recent mass shootings and political pressure on gun control, with the NRA also criticizing Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammunition. The resolution aims to pave the way for broader legislation against the NRA.

Wait, that's 156 words. I can add more details if needed without exceeding 200. Let me check if I included all the moral words:

violence, misinforms, deceive, control, saving, killed, homicide, die, shooting, remedy, gripping, assault, shootings.

In my summary, I have: violence, misinform, deceive, control, saving, killed, remedy, assault, shootings. I'm missing homicide, die, and gripping. Let me see where I can incorporate those.

Maybe change "killed" to "die" or "homicide." For example: "100 Americans die daily from gun violence, making the U.S. homicide rate..." Also, "gripping" could be used in "gripping epidemic."

Let me adjust:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the epidemic of gun violence gripping the U.S. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda to misinform and deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, urging the city to sever ties and avoid business dealings. Supervisor Catherine Stefani justified the move, stating the NRA's opposition to gun control stands in the way of saving lives. The resolution highlights that 100 Americans die daily from gun violence, making the U.S. homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution as a worthless "soundbite remedy," calling it a reckless assault on their freedoms. This follows recent mass shootings and political pressure on gun control, with the NRA also criticizing Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammunition. The resolution aims to pave the way for broader legislation against the NRA.

Now, I've included: violence, misinform, deceive, control, saving, die, homicide, remedy, assault, shootings, gripping. I think that covers most of them. I'm missing "shooting" as a separate word, but I have "mass shootings" which includes it. Maybe I can adjust to include "shooting" explicitly. Alternatively, it's okay if not all are used, as long as as many as possible are included.

Final check: under 200 words, includes moral framing, all key points.
