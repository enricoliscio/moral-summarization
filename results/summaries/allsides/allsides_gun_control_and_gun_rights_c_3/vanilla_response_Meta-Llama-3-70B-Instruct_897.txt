SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization". The resolution connects the NRA to an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US and urges San Francisco to distance itself from the organization by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the NRA. The resolution also calls for the local government to avoid doing business with the NRA or associated organizations. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on the organization and its members. The move comes amid growing national attention on gun violence, following recent mass shootings in California, Ohio, and Texas. The resolution's sponsor, Supervisor Catherine Stefani, hopes the move will pave the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level.
