Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They linked the NRA to the "epidemic of gun violence" and urged distancing from the organization. The resolution also mentions that the NRA spreads "propaganda" to mislead the public about gun dangers. Supervisor Stefani called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and said their opposition to gun control is standing in the way of saving lives. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA responded by condemning the move as a "worthless" and "disgraceful" soundbite remedy. They also criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo. The article mentions recent mass shootings and the pressure on Senate Majority Leader McConnell to take up gun control legislation.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article again and pick out words that carry a moral judgment.

- Epidemic: implies a widespread problem, negative.
- Misinforms: suggests deception, negative.
- Deceive: also deceptive, negative.
- Absolutely disgraceful: clearly negative.
- Worthless: negative.
- Disgraceful: again negative.
- Reckless: implies carelessness, negative.
- Soundbite remedy: suggests insincere or superficial, negative.
- Hurt business: negative impact.
- Not make us any safer: negative outcome.
- Pressure: implies urgency, but not necessarily negative.
- Take up legislation: neutral.
- Support legislation: neutral.
- Background checks: neutral.
- National headlines: neutral.

Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check again.

In the resolution, they mention "propaganda," which is a negative term. Also, "domestic terrorist organization" is a strong negative label. "Opposition to gun control" is framed negatively here. "Saving lives" is positive, but the context is that the NRA is preventing that. "Violence epidemic" is another negative term. "Hurt business" is negative. "Not make us any safer" is negative. "Pressure" is more about the situation, but "real solutions" is positive. "Guided by values" is positive, but the overall context is negative towards the NRA.

So, the morally framed single words are:

epidemic, misinforms, deceive, absolutely disgraceful, worthless, disgraceful, reckless, soundbite remedy, hurt, safer, pressure, real, guided, values, belief, solutions.

Wait, but some of these might not be single words or might not carry the moral framing as intended. Let me make sure each is a single word and carries a moral judgment.

Epidemic: yes, implies a bad situation.
Misinforms: negative action.
Deceive: negative.
Absolutely disgraceful: very negative.
Worthless: negative.
Disgraceful: negative.
Reckless: negative.
Soundbite remedy: the term "soundbite" might not be moral, but "remedy" is more about action. Maybe "soundbite" is more about style than morality. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, "reckless" is definitely moral.
Hurt: negative impact.
Safer: positive, but in the context of not making us safer, so negative.
Pressure: not inherently moral, but in the context of needing to act, maybe.
Real: positive, as in genuine solutions.
Guided: positive, as in following values.
Belief: neutral, but in the context of positive values.
Solutions: positive.

So, I think the main morally framed words are:

epidemic, misinforms, deceive, absolutely disgraceful, worthless, disgraceful, reckless, soundbite, hurt, safer, pressure, real, guided, belief, solutions.

Wait, "soundbite" is part of "soundbite remedy," which is a term used pejoratively, so maybe "soundbite" is part of the moral framing. Alternatively, "soundbite remedy" as a phrase is negative.

I think I should list each single word that is part of the moral framing. So, from the article:

- Epidemic
- Misinforms
- Deceive
- Absolutely disgraceful
- Worthless
- Disgraceful
- Reckless
- Soundbite
- Hurt
- Safer
- Pressure
- Real
- Guided
- Belief
- Solutions

But I'm not sure if "pressure" and "solutions" are morally framed. "Pressure" is more about the situation, while "solutions" are positive actions. Maybe I should include them as they are part of the moral argument.

Now, for the summary, I need to preserve as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the resolution, the reasons, the NRA's response, and the context of recent shootings and political pressure.

I'll structure the summary to mention the resolution, the moral framing terms, the NRA's response, and the broader context.

Let me draft it:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in the epidemic of gun violence. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda that misinforms and deceives the public, contributing to the daily loss of 100 American lives. Supervisor Catherine Stefani called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" for blocking gun control measures. The NRA responded, condemning the resolution as a worthless and reckless attempt to address violence, while Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo also faced criticism. Amid recent mass shootings, the resolution aims to set a precedent for broader legislation, though Senate Majority Leader McConnell has yet to act, awaiting President Trump's support.

I think this captures the moral framing using the identified words. Let me check the word count: it's around 100 words, so under 200. I included epidemic, misinforms, deceive, absolutely disgraceful, worthless, reckless, and others where possible. It flows well and maintains the moral perspective.
