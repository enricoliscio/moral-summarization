SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a *resolution* that declares the National Rifle Association a "*domestic terrorist organization*." The *resolution* connects the NRA to an "*epidemic* of gun *violence*" in the U.S. and *urges* the city to *avoid* doing business with the organization. It accuses the NRA of spreading *propaganda* that *misinforms* and *deceives* the public about the *dangers* of gun *violence*. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the *resolution*, said that the designation is *justified* because the NRA's opposition to gun control is *standing in the way of saving lives*. The NRA *condemned* the *resolution*, calling it a "*reckless assault*" on a law-abiding organization and its *values*, *freedoms*, and efforts to find *solutions* to gun *violence*. The NRA also *criticized* Walmart's recent decision to *stop selling certain ammunition*, saying it would *hurt* business and would *not make* the country *safer*. The *resolution* passed unanimously as a response to recent mass shootings and the ongoing *epidemic of gun violence gripping* the nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
