SUMMARY: 
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a *resolution* that declares the National Rifle Association a "*domestic terrorist organization*." The *resolution* connects the NRA to an "*epidemic* of gun *violence*" in the US and *urges* the city to distance itself from the organization by examining local ties and *avoiding* doing business with the NRA. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the *resolution*, said the designation is justified because the NRA's stance on gun control is "*standing in the way of saving lives*." The NRA *condemned* the *resolution*, calling it a "*reckless assault*" on a "*law-abiding organization*" and its "*freedoms*." This is the second *condemnation* the NRA has faced recently, following Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammunition. The NRA *disgraceful* called Walmart's move "*worthless*" and said it would not make the country safer. The *resolution* passed *unanimously*, reflecting the strong sentiment against the NRA's role in the nation's gun *violence* *epidemic*. Supervisor Stefani hopes the *resolution* will inspire similar *legislation* elsewhere.
END OF SUMMARY.
