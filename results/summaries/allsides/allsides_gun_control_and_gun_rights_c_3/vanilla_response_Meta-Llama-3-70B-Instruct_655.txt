SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA to the "epidemic of gun violence" in the US and urges the city to distance itself from the organization by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the NRA. The resolution also calls for the local government to avoid doing business with the NRA or associated organizations. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justified the designation, stating that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives." The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on the organization and its members. The move comes amid growing national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
