SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading "propaganda" that "deceives" the public about the dangers of gun violence, and labels the organization as "absolutely disgraceful". The supervisors aim to distance themselves from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the organization and avoiding business with it. The resolution is meant to pave the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level. The NRA has condemned the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy'" and a "reckless assault" on its members and their freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
