SUMMARY: 
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution that condemns the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in spreading "propaganda" and contributing to the "epidemic of gun violence" in the United States, which results in 100 Americans killed daily. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, justifies the designation by stating that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives." The resolution calls for San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and its associates by examining and potentially severing ties with vendors and contractors linked to the organization. The NRA, in response, condemns the resolution as a "reckless assault" on their organization and members, stating that they remain "undeterred" and "guided by their values and belief in freedoms." This resolution comes amidst heightened national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings across the country. The NRA has also faced criticism for its stance on gun control, with Walmart recently announcing it will no longer sell certain ammunition, citing concerns for public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
