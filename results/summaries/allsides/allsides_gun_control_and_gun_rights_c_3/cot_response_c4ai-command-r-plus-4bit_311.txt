SUMMARY: 
In a unanimous vote, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution condemning the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in perpetuating gun violence in the United States, which claims the lives of 100 Americans daily and gives the country a gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income nation. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, denounces the NRA's opposition to gun control as an impediment to saving lives, accusing them of spreading deceptive propaganda. The resolution encourages San Francisco to sever ties with the NRA and urges similar actions at other governmental levels. The NRA responded by criticizing the resolution as a "reckless assault" on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms, dismissing it as a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy.'" The condemnation comes amid heightened national attention to gun violence following recent mass shootings and increasing pressure on lawmakers to address the issue. This includes scrutiny of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's stance on gun control legislation. The resolution reflects a growing movement to hold the NRA accountable for its role in obstructing progress towards reducing gun violence and improving public safety.
