SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating gun violence in the US. The resolution connects the NRA to an "epidemic of gun violence" and urges the city to distance itself from the organization by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the NRA. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, justifies the designation by stating that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives.‚Äù The resolution highlights the alarming fact that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on a law-abiding organization. This move is a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level, and serves as a moral call to action to address the devastating impact of gun violence.
