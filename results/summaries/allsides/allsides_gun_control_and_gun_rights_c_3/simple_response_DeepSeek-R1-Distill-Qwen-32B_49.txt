Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The resolution passed unanimously, designating the NRA as a domestic terrorist group because they're seen as opposing gun control, which is linked to gun violence. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA by examining local ties and avoiding business with them. It also mentions the high rate of gun violence in the US compared to other countries. The article also includes the NRA's response, calling the resolution a "soundbite remedy" and an attack on their freedoms. Additionally, there's context about recent shootings and political reactions, like McConnell's stance and Trump's discussions with the NRA.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the resolution and its reason. Then mention the actions San Francisco is taking, the statistics on gun violence, the NRA's response, and the broader context of recent shootings and political inaction.

I should ensure the moral framing is preserved. The article portrays the NRA negatively, so I'll highlight that the resolution is based on their opposition to gun control and the resulting loss of lives. The NRA's response is framed as dismissive and defensive, which I'll include to show their stance.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: resolution passed, reasons, actions taken, statistics, NRA's criticism, and the political backdrop. Keeping each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to make sure each point is covered without being too detailed. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. I'll end with the required tokens.

I think that covers all the key points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its opposition to gun control as a barrier to reducing gun violence. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading misinformation and links its influence to the U.S.'s high gun violence rate, which kills 100 Americans daily. San Francisco plans to examine local vendors' and contractors' ties to the NRA and avoid doing business with it. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" and urged similar legislation at higher levels. The NRA responded by condemning the resolution as a "worthless soundbite remedy," accusing it of attacking their freedoms. This move follows recent mass shootings and ongoing political debates over gun control, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell under pressure to act. END OF SUMMARY.
