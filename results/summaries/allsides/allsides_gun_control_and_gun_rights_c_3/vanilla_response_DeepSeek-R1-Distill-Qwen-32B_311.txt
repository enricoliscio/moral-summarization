Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They linked the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution urges the city to examine ties with the NRA and avoid doing business with them. It also mentions that the resolution is a step towards similar legislation at higher levels.

The resolution argues that the NRA spreads misinformation about gun violence dangers. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored it, saying the NRA's opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. She called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution also states that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries.

The resolution passed unanimously. The NRA responded by condemning it, calling it a "worthless soundbite remedy" and an assault on their freedoms. They also criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo earlier in the week.

Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun violence. Senate Majority Leader McConnell is under pressure to address gun control, but he's waiting for Trump's support. Trump met with NRA head LaPierre in August regarding background checks.

So, the key points are:
- SF declares NRA a domestic terrorist group.
- Reason: linked to gun violence epidemic, spreading misinformation.
- Resolution aims to cut ties and influence higher legislation.
- NRA condemns the move, calls it a political attack.
- Recent shootings and political context.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include all main points clearly and concisely, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without overlap.
