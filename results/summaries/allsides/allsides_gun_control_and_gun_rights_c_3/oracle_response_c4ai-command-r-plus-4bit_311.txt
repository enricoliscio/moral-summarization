SUMMARY: In a unanimous vote, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution denouncing the National Rifle Association as a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution highlights the NRA's role in perpetuating an epidemic of gun violence in the United States, where approximately 100 Americans lose their lives daily due to gun homicide. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, the sponsor of the resolution, emphasizes that the NRA's opposition to gun control measures is a direct impediment to saving lives and that their propaganda misinforms and deceives the public about the dangers of gun violence. The resolution urges San Francisco to examine and sever ties with vendors and contractors associated with the NRA, taking a stand against the disgraceful organization and its role in the recent mass shootings that have gripped the nation. The NRA, in response, condemned the resolution as a "worthless and disgusting" assault on their organization and members, denying their role in the violence epidemic. This bold move by San Francisco sets a precedent for future legislation aimed at holding the NRA accountable for their harmful influence on the nation's gun violence crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
