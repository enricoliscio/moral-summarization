SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization" due to its role in perpetuating an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. The resolution condemns the NRA's opposition to gun control, which is seen as "standing in the way of saving lives." The board urges the city to distance itself from the NRA and avoid doing business with organizations associated with it. The resolution cites the staggering statistic that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the US's gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on their organization and its members. This move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level, and is a strong moral stance against the NRA's harmful influence.
