Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the resolution was passed on Tuesday. It connects the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA by examining vendors' and contractors' ties. They also want to avoid doing business with the NRA or its associates. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda to mislead the public about gun violence dangers.

The resolution passed unanimously, according to a spokesperson. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored it and said the designation is justified because the NRA's opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. She called the organization "absolutely disgraceful."

The article also notes that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA responded by condemning the resolution, calling it a worthless soundbite and an assault on their freedoms. They also criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo earlier in the week.

Additionally, the article mentions recent mass shootings in California, Ohio, and Texas, leading to increased attention on gun violence. Senate Majority Leader McConnell is under pressure to address gun control, but he's waiting for Trump's support. Trump discussed background checks with NRA head LaPierre in August.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the resolution passed, the reasons given (gun violence epidemic, propaganda), the call to distance from NRA, the NRA's response, recent shootings, and the political context with McConnell and Trump.

I should structure it to include the key actors, actions, and reactions. Make sure to mention the resolution's impact on local, state, or federal legislation as per Supervisor Stefani. Also, highlight the NRA's criticism and their stance against the resolution.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and covers all critical elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the resolution's passage, then the reasons, the call to action, the NRA's response, recent events, and the political backdrop.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
