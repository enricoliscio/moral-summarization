SUMMARY:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA to an "epidemic of gun violence" in the US and urges the city to distance itself from the organization. It also calls for the local government to avoid doing business with the NRA or associated organizations. The resolution cites the NRA's opposition to gun control as a major obstacle to saving lives. The move is seen as a step towards similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on a law-abiding organization and its members. The resolution comes amid growing national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings in California, Ohio, and Texas.
