Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They link the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence and want to distance themselves by examining vendors' ties to the NRA. The resolution also urges avoiding business with the NRA. They criticize the NRA for spreading propaganda that misinforms and deceives the public about gun violence dangers. Supervisor Stefani justified the designation, saying the NRA's opposition to gun control is standing in the way of saving lives. The resolution mentions 100 daily gun-related deaths, highlighting the U.S. high homicide rate compared to other high-income countries. The NRA responded by condemning the resolution, calling it a worthless soundbite remedy and an assault on their freedoms. Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun violence, with McConnell under pressure but hesitant to act without Trump's support.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: violence, misinforms, deceive, control, saving, killed, homicide, die, shooting, remedy, gripping, assault, shootings. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and to end with specific tokens. I should structure it to include the main points: the resolution, the reasoning behind it, the impact on business, the NRA's response, and the context of recent shootings.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the resolution, then the reasons, the consequences, the NRA's reaction, and the broader context. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key elements.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and the essential details without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the "epidemic of gun violence" in the U.S. The resolution calls for San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA by examining local vendors' and contractors' ties to the organization and avoiding business with it. It criticizes the NRA for spreading propaganda that "misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence." Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, argued that the NRA's opposition to gun control is "standing in the way of saving lives" and described the organization as "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy'" and an "assault" on its members' freedoms. This move comes amid national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings, including those in Texas and California. END OF SUMMARY.
