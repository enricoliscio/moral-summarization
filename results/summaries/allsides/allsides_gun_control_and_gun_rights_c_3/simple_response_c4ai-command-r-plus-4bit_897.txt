SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution connects the NRA's propaganda and opposition to gun control to the epidemic of gun violence in the US, which has a gun homicide rate 25 times higher than any other high-income country. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, argues that the NRA's actions are "standing in the way of saving lives." The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and for similar legislation to be introduced at other levels of government. This moral stance by San Francisco is a bold statement against the NRA and a call for action to address the issue of gun violence in America. The NRA, however, has condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on law-abiding citizens and their freedoms. This move by San Francisco highlights the growing pressure on politicians and organizations to address gun violence and the role of the NRA in obstructing meaningful reform.

END OF SUMMARY.
