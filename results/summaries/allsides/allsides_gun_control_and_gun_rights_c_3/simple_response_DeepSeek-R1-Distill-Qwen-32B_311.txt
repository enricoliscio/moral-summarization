Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They link the NRA to gun violence and want to distance themselves by examining local vendors and contractors. The resolution aims to influence similar legislation elsewhere. Supervisor Stefani calls the NRA disgraceful and says their opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. The article also mentions the NRA's response, calling the resolution a "soundbite remedy" and an attack on freedoms. Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun control, with political figures like McConnell and Trump involved.

I need to capture the moral stance: San Francisco is taking a stand against the NRA, framing them as harmful. The summary should highlight the resolution, the reasoning, the NRA's criticism, and the broader context of gun control debates.

I should structure it concisely, making sure to include key points: the resolution's declaration, the reasons (gun violence, misinformation), the call to action for other levels of government, the NRA's response, and the political context.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive. Also, ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”San Francisco is condemning the NRA for contributing to violence, while the NRA defends itself as law-abiding.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each important point is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously declared the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the "epidemic of gun violence" in the U.S. The resolution calls for the city to sever ties with the NRA and its affiliates, accusing it of spreading misinformation and obstructing efforts to save lives through gun control. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, described the NRA as "absolutely disgraceful" and emphasized the need for similar legislation at higher levels of government. The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, with the U.S. gun homicide rate being 25 times higher than in other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on its members' freedoms and asserting its commitment to finding real solutions to gun violence. This move comes amid heightened national attention on gun control following recent mass shootings, with political leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump under pressure to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
