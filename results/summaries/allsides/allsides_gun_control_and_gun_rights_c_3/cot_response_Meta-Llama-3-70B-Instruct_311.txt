SUMMARY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization." The resolution condemns the NRA for spreading "propaganda" that misinforms the public about the dangers of gun violence, which is responsible for the "epidemic of gun violence" in the US. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, called the NRA "absolutely disgraceful" for standing in the way of saving lives by opposing gun control. The resolution urges San Francisco to distance itself from the NRA and avoid doing business with the organization or its associates. The NRA has condemned the resolution, calling it a "worthless and disgusting'soundbite remedy'" to the violence epidemic. The move is seen as a step towards paving the way for similar legislation at the local, state, or federal level. END OF SUMMARY.
