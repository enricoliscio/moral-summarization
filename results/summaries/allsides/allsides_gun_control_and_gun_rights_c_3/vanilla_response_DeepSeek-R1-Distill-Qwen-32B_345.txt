Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They connected the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. and want to distance themselves by examining vendors and contractors tied to the NRA. The resolution also urges avoiding business with the NRA or its affiliates. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored it, saying the NRA's opposition to gun control is preventing life-saving measures. She called the organization "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution passed unanimously. The NRA responded by calling it a "worthless soundbite remedy" and accused it of attacking their freedoms. They also criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo. The article mentions recent mass shootings and the pressure on Senate Majority Leader McConnell to address gun control, with Trump discussing background checks with the NRA head.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main action: San Francisco declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. Then, mention the reasons given, like the epidemic of gun violence and the resolution's calls for distancing. Include Supervisor Stefani's comments and the NRA's response. Also, note the recent shootings and the political context with McConnell and Trump. Keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the resolution, the reasons, the response, and the broader context.
