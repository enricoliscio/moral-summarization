Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the NRA as a "domestic terrorist organization." They connected the NRA to the epidemic of gun violence, urged distancing from the organization, and examined local ties. The resolution mentions the NRA spreading propaganda to misinform the public about gun dangers. Supervisor Stefani emphasized the need for legislation to save lives, pointing out the high gun homicide rate. The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA condemned it as a worthless soundbite, accusing it of an assault on their freedoms. Recent shootings have increased attention on gun violence, and political figures are under pressure.

Now, I need to identify the key morally charged words: violence, misinforms, deceive, control, saving, killed, homicide, die, shooting, remedy, gripping, assault, shootings. I'll make sure these are included where appropriate.

I'll structure the summary to include the resolution, the reasons behind it, the impact on legislation, the NRA's response, and the context of recent shootings. I'll keep each sentence concise and ensure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft it:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors declared the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization," linking it to the epidemic of gun violence. They urged distancing from the NRA, examining local ties, and avoiding business with it. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda to misinform and deceive the public about gun dangers. Supervisor Stefani emphasized the need for legislation to save lives, noting 100 daily gun-related deaths and the U.S.'s high homicide rate. The NRA condemned the resolution as a worthless soundbite, accusing it of recklessly assaulting their freedoms. Recent shootings have intensified focus on gun violence, with political pressure mounting, especially on McConnell and Trump to address the issue.

I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. It looks good. I've included all the necessary morally framed words and maintained the structure. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading propaganda to misinform and deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, urging the city to distance itself from the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, argued that the NRA's opposition to gun control is standing in the way of saving lives. The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a worthless "soundbite remedy" and a reckless assault on its freedoms. Recent shootings, including those in Texas and Ohio, have intensified national attention on gun violence, with political figures like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell facing pressure to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
