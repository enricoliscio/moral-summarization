Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors declaring the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. 

First, I need to read the article carefully. The key points are that the resolution was passed, the reasons given by the supervisors, the impact on local businesses, and the NRA's response. 

I should identify the moral elements. The supervisors are framing the NRA as harmful, using terms like "epidemic of gun violence" and "misinforming the public." They also mention the high rate of gun deaths, which adds urgency. 

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the resolution's main points: declaring the NRA a terrorist organization, urging disassociation from vendors and contractors tied to the NRA, and the justification based on public deception and opposition to gun control.

I also need to mention the NRA's response, calling the resolution a "soundbite remedy" and an assault on their freedoms. This shows the conflict and opposing viewpoints.

I should structure the summary to start with the resolution, then the reasons behind it, the call to action for local businesses, the statistics cited, and end with the NRA's rebuttal. 

Make sure to keep the moral framing intact, highlighting the supervisors' stance against the NRA's influence and the NRA's defense of their rights. 

I'll also include the mention of recent shootings and the political context, like McConnell's stance, to show the broader implications.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it, keeping each sentence focused on the main points without extra details.

SUMMARY:  
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a "domestic terrorist organization," citing its role in promoting gun violence and opposing gun control. The resolution accuses the NRA of spreading misinformation to deceive the public about the dangers of firearms, contributing to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. It urges San Francisco to sever ties with the NRA and its affiliates, examining local vendors' and contractors' connections to the organization. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who sponsored the resolution, argued that the NRA's opposition to gun control "stands in the way of saving lives" and described the group as "absolutely disgraceful." The resolution highlights that 100 Americans are killed daily by gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than in other high-income countries. The NRA condemned the resolution, calling it a "reckless assault" on their freedoms and a "worthless soundbite remedy" to gun violence. This move comes amid national attention on gun violence following recent mass shootings, with political pressure mounting on lawmakers to address the issue.  
END OF SUMMARY.
