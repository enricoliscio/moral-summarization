Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passing a resolution declaring the NRA a "domestic terrorist organization." They're linking the NRA to the gun violence epidemic in the U.S. The resolution urges San Francisco to examine its ties with the NRA and avoid doing business with them. They mention that the NRA spreads misinformation about gun violence dangers. Supervisor Catherine Stefani sponsored the resolution, saying it's a step towards similar legislation elsewhere. The resolution notes that 100 Americans die daily from gun violence, making the U.S. gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other high-income countries.

The resolution passed unanimously, and the NRA responded by calling it a worthless soundbite remedy, attacking their freedoms. They also criticized Walmart's decision to stop selling certain ammo. Recent mass shootings have brought attention back to gun control, with McConnell under pressure but waiting for Trump's support.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: the resolution, the reasoning, the impact, NRA's response, and the broader context of gun control debates.

Let me structure it: start with the resolution, mention the epidemic link, the actions San Francisco is taking, the reasoning behind the designation, the unanimously passed fact, the NRA's criticism, recent shootings, and the political context with McConnell and Trump.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.
