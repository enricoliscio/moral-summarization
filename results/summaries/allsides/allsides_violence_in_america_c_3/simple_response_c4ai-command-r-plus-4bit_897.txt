SUMMARY: President Trump visits Pittsburgh synagogue, drawing protests and criticism for his inflammatory rhetoric. Trump's visit comes a week before national elections and amid heightened debate over his encouragement of far-right extremists. Protesters, including Pittsburgh's Jewish community, marched against Trump's rhetoric, which they believe contributed to the surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. The president's trip was met with disapproval, with congressional leaders declining to join him. His brief visit included lighting candles for the victims and meeting with wounded officers and a victim's wife. Meanwhile, the first funerals for the victims were held, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, faces hate crime charges and potential death penalty. Protest organizers and Jewish leaders believe Trump's rhetoric about migrant caravans may have influenced Bowers' anti-Semitic beliefs. The Pittsburgh chapter of Bend the Arc, a Jewish group, released a letter signed by over 78,000 people stating Trump is not welcome until he denounces white nationalism.
END OF SUMMARY.
