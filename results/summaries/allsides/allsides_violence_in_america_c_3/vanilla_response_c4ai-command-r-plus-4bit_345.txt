SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh on Tuesday, following the deadly attack on a synagogue by an anti-Semitic gunman that left 11 people dead. Accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the president lit candles for each of the victims at the Tree of Life temple and paid his respects at a makeshift memorial outside. The visit was met with protests, with thousands rallying against Trump's presence in the city and criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric, which some believe may have contributed to the rise in white nationalist activity. The trip came just a week before crucial national elections, where Republicans are hoping to maintain control of Congress. Trump also visited wounded police officers in the hospital and spent time with the families of the victims, including the wife of one of the slain congregants. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with thousands paying their respects to the Rosenthal brothers at the Rodef Shalom synagogue. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, faces 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty if convicted. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders criticized Trump's rhetoric and his characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion," noting that Bowers had echoed similar sentiments in his social media posts.
END OF SUMMARY.
