SUMMARY:
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, despite widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have provoked the violence. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, condemning his divisive words and actions. The president's visit was seen as ill-timed, and many felt he had not done enough to denounce white nationalism and neo-Nazi activity. Trump lit candles for the victims and placed stones on a memorial, but made no public remarks. The visit came just seven days before national elections, with many seeing the attack as a consequence of the president's harmful rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
