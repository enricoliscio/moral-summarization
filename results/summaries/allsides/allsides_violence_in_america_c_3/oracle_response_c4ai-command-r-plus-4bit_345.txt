SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack. The trip came amid widespread disapproval of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which critics believe may have contributed to provoking the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Protesters, including members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, arguing that his rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists and neo-Nazi activity. They asserted that Trump's rhetoric about migrant caravans may have influenced the gunman, who believed anti-Semitic lies and felt provoked to act. While Trump paid his respects at the memorial, thousands protested his presence, with local Jewish leaders stating that he was not welcome until he fully denounced white nationalism. The first funerals for the victims were held, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, faces 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty. The tragedy has sparked a national debate about the impact of political rhetoric on acts of violence and the rise of far-right extremism.
