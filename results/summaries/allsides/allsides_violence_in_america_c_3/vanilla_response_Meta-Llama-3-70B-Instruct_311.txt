SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, lighting candles for each of the victims. Thousands of protesters gathered nearby, criticizing Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which they believe may have contributed to the attack. Trump's visit came just seven days before national elections and was met with widespread disapproval from congressional leaders and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto. The president and first lady Melania Trump were accompanied by Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, all of whom are Jewish. Trump also visited wounded police officers and the wife of one of the slain congregants. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with over 1,800 people attending. The attack has sparked a national debate over Trump's rhetoric and its potential impact on white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity.
