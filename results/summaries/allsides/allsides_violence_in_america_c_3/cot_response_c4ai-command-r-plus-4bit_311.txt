SUMMARY: Anti-Semitic gunman attacks Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. President Trump visits the site amid protests and criticism for his inflammatory rhetoric. Trump's rhetoric is criticized for provoking the attack and contributing to a surge in far-right extremism. Protesters argue Trump's rhetoric may have provoked the attack by characterizing migrant caravans as an "invasion." The president's visit comes a week before national elections. The first funerals for the victims are held, and the gunman is charged with hate crimes and faces the death penalty. The attack sparks a national debate about the morality of Trump's rhetoric and its encouragement of far-right extremists.
END OF SUMMARY.
