SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, despite widespread disapproval for his inflammatory rhetoric that may have contributed to the deadly attack. Trump and the first lady lit candles for each of the 11 slain worshipers and paid their respects at a memorial outside the synagogue. Thousands of protesters, including members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally during his visit, criticizing his rhetoric and its potential role in provoking the attack. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders have denounced Trump's rhetoric and its potential impact on encouraging far-right extremists. The Pittsburgh chapter of Bend the Arc, a Jewish organization, organized an open letter stating that Trump is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism.
END OF SUMMARY.
