Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. He lit candles and met with families, but there were protests against him. The key points are his presence, the criticism over his rhetoric, and the broader debate on white nationalism.

I should highlight Trump's actions, the reactions from protesters and Jewish leaders, and the context of his rhetoric contributing to the attack. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspects are clear, like the criticism of his words and the rejection by the community.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's visit, mention the protests, his meeting with families, the criticism, and the aftermath. Make sure to include the rejection by Jewish leaders and the connection to his rhetoric.

I should avoid any bias but present the moral framing as given. Keep it concise and include all important elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue after the anti-Semitic attack that killed 11 worshipers, lighting candles in memory of the victims. His visit was met with protests, as critics accused his inflammatory rhetoric of contributing to the violence. Protesters, including members of the Jewish community, marched with signs promoting unity and kindness, referencing the legacy of Fred Rogers. Trump's presence was also condemned by Jewish leaders, who demanded he denounce white nationalism before being welcome in Pittsburgh. The attack has intensified national debates over Trump's words, with critics linking his characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion" to the gunman's anti-Semitic beliefs. The president's visit, which included meeting victims' families, was brief and lacked public remarks, focusing on showing respect. However, his administration rejects claims that his rhetoric has fueled far-right extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
