Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about President Trump visiting the Pittsburgh synagogue after the anti-Semitic attack. He lit candles for the victims, but there were protests against his presence. The author uses words like "attacked," "slain," "provoked," "rhetoric," and "anti-Semitic" which carry strong moral connotations.

I should highlight Trump's visit, the protests, the victims, and the criticism of his rhetoric. Also, mention the connection between his statements and the attack, as well as the public's call for him to denounce white nationalism.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it by mentioning Trump's actions, the protests, the victims' funerals, the political context, and the broader debate about his rhetoric and its impact.

Let me make sure to include terms like "anti-Semitic attack," "slain," "provoke," "respect," "wounded," "charged," "death penalty," "rhetoric," "white nationalist," and "denounce." I'll also note the protesters' signs referencing Fred Rogers, emphasizing kindness and unity.

Finally, I'll conclude with the broader implications of the attack and the calls for Trump to address the issues. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. Thousands protested his presence, accusing his inflammatory rhetoric of provoking the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump, accompanied by Melania, entered the Tree of Life temple to show respect, though some criticized the timing. Protesters, including members of Pittsburghâ€™s Jewish community, held signs promoting friendship and kindness, referencing Fred Rogers. Trump also visited wounded police officers and the family of a slain congregant. His visit came amid heightened debate over his rhetoric, which critics say has encouraged white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. The gunman, Robert Bowers, was charged with hate crimes, and his actions were linked to anti-Semitic lies about Jews funding migrant caravans. Protesters and Jewish leaders called on Trump to denounce white nationalism, with over 78,000 signing a letter rejecting his presence until he does so. The attack underscored the national debate over rhetoric, provocation, and the need for unity. END OF SUMMARY.
