SUMMARY:

U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where an anti-Semitic gunman attacked and killed 11 worshipers, sparking widespread criticism for his inflammatory rhetoric that may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Despite protests from thousands, including members of the Jewish community, Trump lit candles for each of the slain victims and placed stones on a memorial outside the temple. The visit came just seven days before national elections, with critics accusing Trump of fueling white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity through his rhetoric. Protest organizers claimed that Trump's tweets about the Central American migrant caravan may have contributed to the attack, as the gunman believed anti-Semitic lies that Jews were funding the caravan. Trump's administration has rejected the notion that he has encouraged far-right extremists. The visit was met with protests, with many calling for Trump to fully denounce white nationalism.
