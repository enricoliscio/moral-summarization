Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Trump visiting a Pittsburgh synagogue after a tragic shooting. There are several moral words used, like "attacked," "slain," "provoked," "respect," and others. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key events: Trump visited the synagogue, lit candles, protesters were there, the attack details, and the political context. I need to highlight the moral aspects, such as the attack being provoked by Trump's rhetoric, the respect shown, and the criticism he faced.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's actions, the reaction from protesters, the details of the attack, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words where appropriate. I also need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included naturally. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure clarity. Finally, I'll review to make sure the moral framing is preserved as per the author's original intent.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. Thousands protested his presence, criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric, which critics claim may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump, accompanied by Melania, entered the Tree of Life temple, where Rabbi Jeffrey Myers greeted them. They lit yahrzeit candles and placed flowers and stones at a memorial. Trump’s visit, described as “very humbling and sad,” was brief and without public remarks. Protesters, including members of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, rallied nearby, chanting psalms and carrying signs promoting unity and kindness. Trump also visited a hospital to meet wounded police officers and the family of slain congregant Richard Gottfried. The visit occurred a week before national elections, with Trump’s daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining him. The attack has intensified debate over Trump’s rhetoric, accused of contributing to white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protesters linked Trump’s tweets about migrant caravans to the gunman’s actions, as the suspect referenced Jewish organizations in his social media posts. Over 78,000 people signed a letter urging Trump to denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. END OF SUMMARY.
