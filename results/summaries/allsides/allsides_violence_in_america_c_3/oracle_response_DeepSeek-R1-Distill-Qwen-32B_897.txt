Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. The author uses words like "attacked," "slain," and "provoked," which carry strong moral connotations. I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

I notice that the article talks about the attack being the deadliest on American Jewry. That's a significant point, so I'll include that. Also, the criticism of Trump's rhetoric is important because it's linked to the attack. I should mention how his words might have provoked the gunman.

The protest against Trump's visit is another key point. The protesters are diverse and include the Jewish community, so I'll note that. They're using slogans like "We build bridges not walls," which ties into themes of friendship and kindness, so those words should be included.

The gunman's social media post referencing Jewish organizations and the caravan is a crucial detail. It shows how Trump's rhetoric might have influenced the attacker, so I need to highlight that.

Also, the fact that Trump was accompanied by Jewish advisors and the mayor's disapproval adds context to the visit. I should mention that some family members wanted him there, but others felt it was insensitive.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll structure it to cover Trump's visit, the criticism, the protest, the gunman's motivations, and the broader implications of Trump's rhetoric.

Let me make sure I include words like "provoked," "attack," "rhetoric," "protest," "friendship," "kindness," "charged," "death," "lies," and "denounce." I'll also mention the national debate and the call to denounce white nationalism.

I should avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts presented, ensuring the moral framing is clear. Keeping it all within the word limit while covering all these points is the challenge. I'll need to be concise but thorough.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. I'll start with Trump's visit, then the criticism, the protest, the gunman's motivations, and conclude with the national debate and calls for denouncing extremism. That should cover all the key moral points from the article.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. The visit came amid widespread criticism of his inflammatory rhetoric, which critics argue may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands protested his presence, chanting slogans like "We build bridges not walls" and invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers, a symbol of friendship and kindness. Trump's visit, described as "humbling and sad" by his press secretary, included meeting the families of victims and visiting wounded police officers. However, the trip sparked debate over its timing and relevance, with Pittsburgh’s mayor calling it ill-timed. The attack has intensified national scrutiny of Trump’s rhetoric, which critics claim has encouraged white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protesters accused Trump of contributing to the bloodshed through his tweets about migrant caravans, which the gunman referenced in a post. The accused shooter, Robert Bowers, was charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. Local Jewish leaders have called on Trump to denounce white nationalism before being welcomed in Pittsburgh. END OF SUMMARY.
