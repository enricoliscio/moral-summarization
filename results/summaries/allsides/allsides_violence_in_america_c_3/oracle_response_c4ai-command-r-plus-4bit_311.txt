SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman and paid his respects to the 11 slain worshipers, despite facing widespread disapproval for his inflammatory rhetoric that critics say may have helped provoke the attack. While thousands protested his presence, Trump lit candles and spent time with the families of the victims, including the wife of slain congregant Richard Gottfried. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with more than 1,800 people paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty. The attack has sparked a national debate over Trump's rhetoric and its potential encouragement of far-right extremists, with protest organizers and local Jewish leaders stating that Trump's words and actions have contributed to provoking the bloodshed and encouraging white nationalism.
