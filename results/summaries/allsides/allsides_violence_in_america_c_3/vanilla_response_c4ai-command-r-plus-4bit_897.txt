SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in a shooting rampage, despite protests from local leaders and Jewish community members. Accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the president lit candles for each of the victims and paid his respects at a memorial outside the synagogue. The visit came amid criticism of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which many believe may have contributed to the rise in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protesters held an anti-Trump rally, carrying signs invoking the late Fred Rogers and his lessons on friendship and kindness. The first funerals for the victims were also held, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, was charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. The attack has sparked a national debate about Trump's rhetoric, with critics arguing that his words may have influenced the shooter's actions. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders believe that Trump's rhetoric about migrant caravans may have influenced the shooter's anti-Semitic beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
