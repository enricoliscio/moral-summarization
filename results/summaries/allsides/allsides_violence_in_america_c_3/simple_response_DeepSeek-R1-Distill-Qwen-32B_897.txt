Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article is about Trump visiting the Pittsburgh synagogue after the shooting. He lit candles and met with victims' families. There were protests against him, people saying his rhetoric contributed to the attack. He was accompanied by Jewish advisers. The attack was the deadliest on American Jews, and the gunman had anti-Semitic motives. The article also mentions the upcoming elections and the debate over Trump's words.

I should highlight the key points: Trump's visit, the protests, the criticism of his rhetoric, the context of the attack, and the political timing. I need to keep the moral aspects, like whether his visit was appropriate and if his words incited violence. Also, include the Jewish community's response and the election context.

I'll start by stating Trump visited the synagogue, then mention the protests and criticism about his rhetoric. Then note the attack details, the political timing, and the community's reaction. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include the moral framing elements like the debate over his influence and the community's rejection.

Alright, let me put that together clearly and concisely.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 victims, while protests erupted over his presence. Critics argue Trump's inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the attack, the deadliest on American Jews. Despite criticism, Trump met with victims' families and Jewish leaders, including advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. The visit came amid national debate over his words, which some claim fueled white nationalist activity. Protesters accused Trump's rhetoric about migrant caravans of inciting the gunman, who referenced anti-Semitic lies about Jews funding the caravans. Local Jewish leaders called on Trump to denounce white nationalism before being welcome in Pittsburgh. The attack heightened tensions as the nation approached midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
