Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Trump's visit to a Pittsburgh synagogue after a mass shooting. They also outlined a specific process: first, identify all morally framed single words, then write a summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. I need to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "anti-Semitic," "inflammatory," "provoked," "deadliest," "humbling," "sad," "disapproval," "ill-timed," "provoke," "respect," "friendship," "kindness," "build bridges," "walls," "hate crimes," "surge," "white nationalist," "neo-Nazi," "invasion," "terrorists," "slaughtered," "anti-Semitic lies," "funding," "immoral," "agenda." These words are charged with moral implications, so they should be included in the summary.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's visit and the moral criticism surrounding it. I'll note the protests and the moral stance taken by the protesters. Then, I'll touch on the victims and the gunman's motivations, linking back to Trump's rhetoric. Finally, I'll include the political context and the Jewish community's response, emphasizing the moral issues involved.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. I'll make sure each sentence conveys the moral framing accurately, reflecting the author's perspective on Trump's actions and their consequences.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with Trump's visit, mention the moral criticism, the protests, the victims, the gunman's statements, the political timing, and the community's rejection of Trump until he denounces white nationalism. Each of these points will incorporate the morally framed words identified earlier.

I think that covers all the necessary elements. Time to draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and preserves the moral framing as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  

U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. His visit drew widespread disapproval, with protesters denouncing his presence and accusing his inflammatory rhetoric of provoking the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Critics argued Trump’s words, including his characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion," may have fueled the gunman’s anti-Semitic beliefs. The gunman, Robert Bowers, referenced Jewish organizations in his social media posts, echoing anti-Semitic lies that Jews were funding the caravan. Trump’s visit, described as "humbling and sad," was met with protests, including a rally invoking the values of friendship and kindness championed by Fred Rogers. The attack heightened national debate over Trump’s rhetoric and its link to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Jewish leaders and protesters demanded Trump denounce white nationalism, calling his presence in Pittsburgh unwelcome until he does so. The visit came amid heightened political tensions, seven days before the midterm elections.
