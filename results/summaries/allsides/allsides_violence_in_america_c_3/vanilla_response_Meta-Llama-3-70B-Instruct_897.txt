SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack. Trump lit candles for each of the victims and placed stones on a memorial outside the temple. The visit came amidst widespread criticism of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which some believe may have contributed to the attack. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally nearby, citing Trump's divisive language and perceived ties to white nationalism. The president's visit was seen as ill-timed by some, including Pittsburgh's mayor, and was not joined by congressional leaders. Trump also visited wounded police officers and met with the wife of one of the slain congregants. The visit came just a week before national elections, which will determine control of Congress.
