SUMMARY:
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, amid widespread disapproval for his inflammatory rhetoric that critics say may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, singing Old Testament psalms and carrying signs with slogans such as "We build bridges not walls." Trump's visit came just seven days before national elections, with critics arguing that his rhetoric has contributed to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protest organizers said Trump's tweets about the caravans of Central American migrants may have been a factor in provoking the attack, which has heightened a national debate over his rhetoric.
