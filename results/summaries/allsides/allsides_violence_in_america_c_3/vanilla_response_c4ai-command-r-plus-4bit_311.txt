SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue that was attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, despite protests from thousands of people and criticism from local Jewish leaders. Accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump lit candles for each of the 11 slain worshipers and paid his respects at a memorial outside the synagogue. The visit came just a week before national elections and amid widespread disapproval of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which many believe may have contributed to the surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders argued that Trump's rhetoric, including his characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion," may have been a factor in provoking the attack. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with more than 1,800 people paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes.
