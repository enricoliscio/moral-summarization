SUMMARY:
Amid widespread *protest* and *disapproval* over his *inflammatory* rhetoric, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh on Tuesday, less than a week after a *hateful* shooting *attack* at a synagogue that left 11 *slain* worshippers. Trump's visit, which some congressional leaders declined to join, was met with *protest* from thousands of people, including members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. They asserted that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a surge in white *nationalism* and *immoral* activity. The *protest* organizers and local Jewish leaders criticized Trump's characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion" and his false claims about *financed* *terrorists*, which they believed may have contributed to the *murderous* *anti-Semitic* *attack*. The president, accompanied by his wife Melania, first daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, spent about 30 minutes at the Tree of Life synagogue, where he lit candles in memory of the *slain* and visited injured police officers at a hospital. The first funerals for the victims were also held on Tuesday, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including *hate crimes*, and could face the death penalty. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections that will determine control of Congress, with the president facing intense scrutiny over his divisive rhetoric and its potential impact on encouraging far-right extremists.
