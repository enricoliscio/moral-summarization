SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, amidst widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, citing his divisive language and accusing him of provoking the attack. Trump lit candles for the victims and visited wounded police officers, but made no public remarks. The visit came just a week before national elections, and critics argue that Trump's rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists and neo-Nazis. Protest organizers pointed to Trump's tweets about the migrant caravan, which they say may have inspired the gunman's beliefs. Local Jewish leaders have called on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism before being welcomed in Pittsburgh.
