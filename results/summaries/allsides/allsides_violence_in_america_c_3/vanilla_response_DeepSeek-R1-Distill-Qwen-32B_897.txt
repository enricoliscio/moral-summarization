Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. He lit candles for the 11 victims. There were protests against him. Critics say his rhetoric might have contributed to the attack. He was accompanied by Melania, Ivanka, and Kushner. The visit was short, no public remarks. The attack happened a week before the elections. The gunman's motivations were linked to anti-Semitic beliefs and Trump's comments about migrants. The article also mentions a rally against Trump and a letter from Jewish leaders rejecting his visit until he denounces white nationalism.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's visit, the protests, the criticism of his rhetoric, the political context, and the gunman's motivations. Make sure to include key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Trump visits Pittsburgh synagogue, 11 killed, protests, criticism of his rhetoric, the visit's context, and the gunman's ties to anti-Semitism and Trump's statements.

I should keep it clear and to the point, making sure each main point is covered succinctly.
