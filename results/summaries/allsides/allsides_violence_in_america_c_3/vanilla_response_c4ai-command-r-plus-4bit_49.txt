SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, following the deadly attack on a synagogue by an anti-Semitic gunman that left 11 people dead. Accompanied by the first lady Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the president paid his respects at the Tree of Life synagogue and lit candles for each of the victims. The visit was met with protests from thousands of people, who criticized Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and its potential role in provoking the attack. Protesters carried signs invoking Fred Rogers, a beloved resident of the city, and his messages of friendship and kindness. Trump's visit came just a week before crucial national elections, where control of Congress is at stake. Earlier in the day, the first funerals for the victims were held, with more than 1,800 people paying their respects to two brothers, David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were killed in the attack. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, faces 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty if convicted. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders have criticized Trump's rhetoric, arguing that his words may have contributed to the surge in white nationalist activity and the attack itself.
END OF SUMMARY.
