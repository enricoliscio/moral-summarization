SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh on Tuesday, lighting candles for each of the 11 worshipers slain in the anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue. Trump's visit drew protests from thousands, who accused him of inflammatory rhetoric that may have helped provoke the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump entered the synagogue with First Lady Melania Trump and lit ritual candles in memory of the victims. They then visited a memorial outside, where the first lady placed a flower and the president a stone for each of the dead. Protesters held an anti-Trump rally, carrying signs invoking the late Fred Rogers and his lessons on friendship and kindness. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with more than 1,800 people paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty. The attack has sparked a national debate over Trump's rhetoric and its potential encouragement of white nationalist activity. Protest organizers and Jewish leaders stated that Trump's rhetoric may have helped provoke the attack, and that he is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism.
END OF SUMMARY.
