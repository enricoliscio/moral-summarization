SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, sparking widespread criticism and protests. Trump's visit was seen as ill-timed and inflammatory, as his rhetoric has been accused of provoking the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Despite this, Trump lit candles for each of the victims and paid respects at a memorial outside the synagogue. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, condemning Trump's presence and his divisive rhetoric. The protesters invoked the legacy of Fred Rogers, a beloved Pittsburgh resident who preached kindness and friendship. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections, which will determine control of Congress. The attack has heightened a national debate over Trump's rhetoric, which critics say has contributed to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity.
