Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Donald Trump visiting the Pittsburgh synagogue after the shooting. He lit candles for the 11 victims. There were protests against his visit. Some people think his rhetoric contributed to the attack. He also visited a hospital where he met police officers and the family of a victim. The article mentions the national elections are coming up, and there's a debate about his words encouraging white nationalists. The gunman had ties to anti-Semitic beliefs and referenced Trump's comments about migrants. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should include the key points: Trump's visit, the protests, the victims, his meeting with families, the context of the elections, and the criticism about his rhetoric. I should make sure to mention the timing of the visit, the reactions from both supporters and critics, and the broader implications of the attack. Also, include the fact that the gunman was charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. I need to keep it concise but cover all main events and issues.
