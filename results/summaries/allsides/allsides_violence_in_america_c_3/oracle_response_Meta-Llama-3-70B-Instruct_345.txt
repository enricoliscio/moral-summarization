SUMMARY:

U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for each of the 11 slain worshipers. Thousands protested his presence, criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric that may have provoked the deadliest attack ever on American Jewry. Trump's visit came amidst widespread disapproval, with many accusing him of encouraging white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. The president's trip was seen as ill-timed, with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and congressional leaders of both parties declining to join. Trump's visit was marked by respect and kindness, as he lit ritual yahrzeit candles and placed stones on a memorial for each of the dead. However, protesters held an anti-Trump rally, invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers, who taught friendship and kindness. The visit came just seven days before national elections, with Trump's rhetoric and actions under scrutiny. The attack has heightened a national debate over Trump's words, with many saying they have contributed to a surge in hate crimes and bloodshed. END OF SUMMARY.
