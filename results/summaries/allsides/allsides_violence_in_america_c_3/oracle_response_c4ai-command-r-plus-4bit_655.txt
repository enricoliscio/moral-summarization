SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman and lit candles for each of the 11 slain worshipers. The trip came amid widespread disapproval of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which critics say may have contributed to provoking the deadliest attack ever on American Jewry. Protesters, including members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, asserting that the president's rhetoric has encouraged far-right extremists. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with thousands paying their respects. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. Protest organizers and Jewish leaders have criticized Trump for his failure to denounce white nationalism and for spreading anti-Semitic lies. More than 78,000 people signed a letter stating that Trump is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism.
