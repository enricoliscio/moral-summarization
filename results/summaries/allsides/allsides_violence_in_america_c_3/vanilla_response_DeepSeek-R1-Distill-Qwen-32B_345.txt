Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, so I should focus on the main points.

First, Trump visited the synagogue, lit candles, and spent about 30 minutes there. He was accompanied by Melania, Ivanka, Kushner, and Mnuchin. Some people protested his visit, including members of the Jewish community, and there were funerals happening too.

The article mentions that Trump's visit was criticized because some think his rhetoric contributed to the attack. The gunman had anti-Semitic views and referenced Trump's comments about migrants. The attack is the deadliest on Jews in US history, so that's important to note.

Also, the visit happened a week before the midterm elections, which adds context about timing. The protesters were against Trump's policies, like the border wall, and referenced Fred Rogers, emphasizing kindness.

I should include the details about the victims, the funerals, the charges against the gunman, and the broader debate over Trump's impact on hate crimes. Make sure to mention the Jewish leaders' letter rejecting Trump's visit until he denounces white nationalism.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's actions, the protests, the victims, the attack's significance, and the political context. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.
