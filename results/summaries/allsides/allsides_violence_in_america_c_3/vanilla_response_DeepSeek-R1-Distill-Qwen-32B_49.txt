Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Donald Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. He went to the Tree of Life synagogue, lit candles, and placed stones as a memorial. There were protests against his visit, with people saying his rhetoric might have contributed to the attack. The shooting was the deadliest on American Jewry. Trump's visit was brief, and he didn't make any public statements. His supporters included the first lady, Ivanka, Kushner, and Mnuchin, all Jewish. The attack has sparked debates about Trump's words and their impact on hate crimes. The article also mentions the funerals and the suspect's charges.

I should include the main points: Trump's visit, the protests, the victims, the political context, and the criticism regarding his rhetoric. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
