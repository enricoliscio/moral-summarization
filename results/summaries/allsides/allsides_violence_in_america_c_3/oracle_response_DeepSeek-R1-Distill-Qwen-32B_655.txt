Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue after the attack, which was met with protests. The attack was anti-Semitic, and there's criticism about Trump's rhetoric possibly provoking it. The author uses words like "provoked," "attack," "slain," etc., so I should keep those.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's visit and the protests. Then, note the anti-Semitic attack and the victims. Include the criticism about his rhetoric and how it might have contributed to the attack. Also, mention the protesters' slogans and the rally's purpose. Highlight the moral words like "provoked," "attack," "slain," "respect," "friendship," "kindness," "wounded," etc.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include the key moral terms and the main events without going into too much detail. Also, mention the upcoming elections and the political context briefly.

Let me structure it: Trump's visit, the attack details, criticism of his rhetoric, the protests, the moral framing words, and the political implications. That should cover the essential points while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. Thousands protested his presence, criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric, which critics argue may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump, accompanied by Melania, entered the synagogue, where Rabbi Jeffrey Myers greeted them. They placed flowers and stones at a memorial, with Trump later visiting wounded police officers and the family of a slain congregant. The visit came amid national debate over Trump's rhetoric, accused of encouraging white nationalist activity. Protesters, including Pittsburgh's Jewish community, rallied against Trump, chanting psalms and carrying signs promoting "friendship and kindness," referencing Fred Rogers. The attack has heightened scrutiny of Trump's statements, including his characterization of migrant caravans as an "invasion," which some linked to the gunman's anti-Semitic beliefs. The gunman, Robert Bowers, was charged with hate crimes, and over 78,000 people signed a letter urging Trump to denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. END OF SUMMARY.
