SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue that was attacked by a gunman in an anti-Semitic attack that killed 11 people. Accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the president lit candles for each of the victims and spent time with the families of those killed and wounded in the shooting. The visit came amid criticism of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, with many believing his words may have helped provoke the attack. Protesters gathered near the synagogue during Trump's visit, expressing their disapproval of his presence and his failure to fully denounce white nationalism. The president's trip also coincided with the first funerals for the victims, as well as the charging of the accused gunman, Robert Bowers, with federal hate crimes. The attack has sparked a national debate about the surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity and the role of Trump's rhetoric in encouraging far-right extremism. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders believe Trump's rhetoric about migrant caravans may have influenced the gunman's beliefs.
