Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump visiting a Pittsburgh synagogue after a mass shooting, the protests against his visit, and the moral implications of his rhetoric.

I should identify key events: the attack, the slain victims, the protest, Trump's visit, and the criticism about his rhetoric provoking the attack. I need to use words like "attacked," "slain," "provoke," "respect," etc.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's visit, the protests, the moral criticism, and the context of the shooting. I'll make sure to mention the anti-Semitic gunman and the aftermath, including the funerals and the political implications.

I should also include the points about Trump's rhetoric contributing to the attack and the protesters' signs about kindness and friendship. I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral framing words without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers, as thousands protested his presence. The visit came amid widespread disapproval of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which critics argue may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump, accompanied by Melania, entered the Tree of Life temple, where Rabbi Jeffrey Myers greeted them. They lit yahrzeit candles and placed flowers and stones at a memorial. Trump's brief visit focused on showing respect for victims and Jewish Americans, according to his press secretary. Meanwhile, protesters, including members of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, chanting psalms and carrying signs promoting friendship and kindness. Trump also visited wounded police officers and met the wife of a slain congregant. The visit occurred just days before the midterm elections. Protesters accused Trump’s rhetoric, including his characterization of migrant caravans as an “invasion,” of contributing to the attack. The gunman, Robert Bowers, referenced anti-Semitic lies about Jews funding the caravan in a social media post. Local Jewish leaders called on Trump to denounce white nationalism, with over 78,000 signing a letter stating he was not welcome in Pittsburgh until he does so. END OF SUMMARY.
