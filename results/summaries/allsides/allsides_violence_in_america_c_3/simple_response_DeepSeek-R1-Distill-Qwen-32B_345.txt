Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump visiting Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. The author's moral stance seems critical, especially regarding Trump's rhetoric and its potential impact.

First, I'll identify the key points: Trump visits the synagogue, faces protests, and there's criticism about his timing and rhetoric. The article mentions that his visit was brief and without public remarks. It also talks about the victims' funerals and the broader debate over his words contributing to the attack.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like the criticism of his rhetoric and the protest against his presence. I should mention the accusations that his inflammatory language might have encouraged the attack. Also, the protesters' signs and the letter from Jewish leaders are important for the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's visit, the protests, the criticism of his rhetoric, the victims, and the broader implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral elements are clear.

Let me start drafting: Trump visited Pittsburgh synagogue, faced protests, criticized for rhetoric. Mention the 11 slain, his brief visit, Melania's actions. Note the protests, signs about kindness, Fred Rogers. Criticism links his words to the attack, the gunman's social media post. The open letter from Jewish leaders and the debate over his influence on white nationalists.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures all these points succinctly. Also, end with the impact on the election context.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary, making sure to highlight the moral aspects as per the author's framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers, as thousands protested his presence. Critics accused Trump's inflammatory rhetoric of potentially provoking the attack, the deadliest on American Jewry. Despite Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto's assertion that the visit was ill-timed, Trump and Melania Trump entered the synagogue, met Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, and placed stones at a memorial. Trump's brief, quiet visit came amid national debate over his words and their impact on white nationalist activity. Protesters, including Pittsburgh's Jewish community, rallied against Trump, carrying signs promoting unity and invoking Fred Rogers' message of kindness. The attack has heightened scrutiny of Trump's rhetoric, with critics linking his comments on migrant caravans to the gunman's anti-Semitic beliefs. The gunman, Robert Bowers, referenced Jewish aid organizations in his social media posts. Over 78,000 people signed an open letter from local Jewish leaders, urging Trump to denounce white nationalism before being welcome in Pittsburgh. The visit occurred amid the national election context, with Trump's administration rejecting claims that his words encourage far-right extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
