SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, despite widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the tragedy. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, accusing Trump of provoking the attack with his divisive language. The president lit candles for the victims and placed stones on a memorial, but made no public remarks. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections, and his critics argue that his rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists and neo-Nazis. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, had posted anti-Semitic lies on social media, echoing Trump's own rhetoric about the migrant caravan. Local Jewish leaders have called on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism, and over 78,000 people have signed a letter telling him he is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he does so.

END OF SUMMARY.
