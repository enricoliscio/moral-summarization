SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, despite widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the tragedy. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, condemning Trump's presence and holding signs with slogans like "We build bridges not walls." The president's visit was seen as ill-timed by Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, and congressional leaders of both parties declined to join him. Trump lit candles for each of the victims and placed stones on a memorial, but made no public remarks. The visit came just seven days before national elections, with critics arguing that Trump's rhetoric has fueled white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protesters pointed to Trump's tweets about the migrant caravan, which they say may have provoked the attack. Local Jewish leaders have called on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism, with over 78,000 people signing an open letter telling him he is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he does so.

END OF SUMMARY.
