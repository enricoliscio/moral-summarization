SUMMARY:
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, sparking widespread criticism and protests. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric was seen as provocative and contributing to the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Despite this, Trump lit candles for each of the victims and placed stones on a memorial, describing the visit as "very humbling and sad." However, thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held an anti-Trump rally, criticizing his words and actions as perpetuating hatred and white nationalism. The protesters echoed an open letter from local Jewish leaders, telling Trump he was not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounced white nationalism. The visit came just seven days before national elections, with many seeing it as an attempt to sway voters. END OF SUMMARY.
