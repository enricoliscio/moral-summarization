SUMMARY:
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, amidst widespread disapproval of his inflammatory rhetoric that critics say may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands protested his presence, citing his words as hateful and divisive, while Trump lit candles for the victims and placed stones on a memorial. The president's visit came just seven days before national elections, with critics accusing him of contributing to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity through his rhetoric. Protest organizers noted that the gunman believed anti-Semitic lies that Jews were funding the caravan, echoing Trump's false statements about the caravans of Central American migrants. The visit was seen as ill-timed, with many calling on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism. END OF SUMMARY.
