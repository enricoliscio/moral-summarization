Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "anti-Semitic," "inflammatory," "provoke," etc., stand out as they relate to moral judgment.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, keeping it under 200 words. The summary should include as many of those morally framed words as possible to maintain the original's tone and message.

I should ensure that the summary captures the key events: Trump's visit to the synagogue, the protests against him, the victims' funerals, and the criticism regarding his rhetoric. I'll also mention the connection between his statements and the attack, as well as the political context before the elections.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without being too lengthy. I'll check each sentence to see if it contributes to the moral framing and whether it's necessary for the summary.

Finally, I'll structure the response with the step-by-step identification of moral words and then the summary, making sure to follow the user's formatting instructions precisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain victims. Thousands protested his presence, criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric, which some believe may have provoked the attack. Trump's visit was met with disapproval, as many saw it as ill-timed. The president and first lady Melania Trump paid respects at the memorial, while protesters, including members of the Jewish community, rallied against Trump, chanting "We build bridges not walls" and invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers, a symbol of kindness. Trump also visited wounded police officers and met with the family of a slain congregant. The visit came amid heightened national debate over Trump's rhetoric, which critics argue has fueled white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protest organizers accused Trump of contributing to the attack by characterizing migrant caravans as an "invasion," linking his words to the gunman's anti-Semitic beliefs. Over 78,000 people signed a letter rejecting Trump's visit until he fully denounces white nationalism. The attack has deepened divisions, with moral and political implications as the nation approaches the midterm elections.
