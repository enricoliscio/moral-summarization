Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "anti-Semitic," "inflammatory," "provoked," "disapproval," "ill-timed," "humbling," "sad," "respect," "showing respect," "controversial," "rhetoric," "hate crimes," "surge," "white nationalist," "neo-Nazi," "anti-Semitic lies," "invasion," "slaughtered," "immoral," "agenda," and "oppression." These words reflect the moral judgment in the article, so I'll list them each with a *.

For the SUMMARY, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. The key points are Trump's visit to the synagogue, the protests against him, the criticism of his rhetoric, the attack details, and the broader implications of his words. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, such as the controversy around his visit, the criticism of his inflammatory speech, and the connection to the attack.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all essential elements without being too verbose. I'll start by mentioning Trump's visit and the protests, then the context of the attack, followed by the criticism of his rhetoric and its potential impact. Finally, I'll touch on the moral implications and the public's reaction, including the letter from Jewish leaders.

I need to be careful to preserve the moral framing without adding any personal opinions. The summary should reflect the author's perspective as presented in the article. I'll make sure each sentence ties back to the moral issues raised, like the surge in hate crimes and the association with Trump's statements.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key moral points are included. I'll also check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the intended moral tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 slain worshipers. Thousands protested his presence, criticizing his inflammatory rhetoric, which critics claim may have contributed to the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Trump’s visit, described as “humbling and sad,” was met with disapproval, including from Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, who called it ill-timed. Protesters, including members of the Jewish community, rallied against Trump, chanting slogans like “We build bridges not walls” and invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers. Trump also visited a hospital to meet wounded police officers and the family of a slain congregant. His visit came amid heightened scrutiny of his rhetoric, which critics argue has fueled a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. The gunman, Robert Bowers, referenced anti-Semitic lies about Jews funding a caravan of migrants, echoing Trump’s characterization of the caravan as an “invasion.” Over 78,000 people signed a letter urging Trump to denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. The attack and Trump’s response reignited debates about the moral implications of his words and actions.
