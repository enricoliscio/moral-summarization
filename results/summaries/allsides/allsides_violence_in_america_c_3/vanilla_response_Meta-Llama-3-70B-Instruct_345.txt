SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, despite widespread criticism and protests. Trump lit candles for each of the victims and placed a small stone on a memorial outside the temple. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, held a rally nearby, criticizing Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and accusing him of provoking the attack. The protesters carried signs and sang Old Testament psalms, invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers, a famous resident of Squirrel Hill. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections, and critics argue that his rhetoric has contributed to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes.
