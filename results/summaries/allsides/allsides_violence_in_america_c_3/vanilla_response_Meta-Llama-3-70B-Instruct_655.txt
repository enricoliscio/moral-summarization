SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, lighting candles for each victim and placing stones on a memorial. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, criticizing Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which they believe may have contributed to the attack. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections and was met with widespread disapproval. The president and first lady Melania Trump were joined by Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, all of whom are Jewish. Trump did not make any public remarks during his 30-minute visit. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with over 1,800 people attending. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes.
