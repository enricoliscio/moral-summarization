SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, lighting candles for each victim. Thousands of protesters gathered nearby, criticizing Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, which they believe may have contributed to the attack. Trump's visit was met with disapproval from congressional leaders and Pittsburgh's mayor, who felt it was ill-timed. Despite this, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump spent 30 minutes at the synagogue, paying respects to the victims. They also visited wounded police officers and the wife of one of the slain congregants. The visit came just a week before national elections, which will determine control of Congress. The attack has sparked a national debate over Trump's rhetoric and its potential link to white nationalist activity.

END OF SUMMARY.
