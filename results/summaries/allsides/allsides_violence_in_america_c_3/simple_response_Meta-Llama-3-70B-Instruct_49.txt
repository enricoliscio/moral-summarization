SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, amidst widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, condemning Trump's presence and accusing him of provoking the attack through his divisive language. The protesters invoked the legacy of Fred Rogers, a beloved Pittsburgh resident who promoted kindness and friendship. Trump's visit was seen as ill-timed by many, including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, and was met with chants of "We build bridges not walls." The president's actions were widely seen as insufficient, particularly given his history of rhetoric that has been criticized for emboldening white nationalists and neo-Nazis.

END OF SUMMARY.
