SUMMARY:

US President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were killed in an anti-Semitic attack, amidst widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have contributed to the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, condemning Trump's presence and rhetoric. The president and first lady Melania Trump lit candles for each of the victims and placed stones on a memorial outside the synagogue. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections, and critics argue that his rhetoric has fueled white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. Protest organizers pointed to Trump's tweets about the migrant caravan, which they say may have provoked the attack. Local Jewish leaders have called on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism, and over 78,000 people have signed a letter telling him he is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he does so.
