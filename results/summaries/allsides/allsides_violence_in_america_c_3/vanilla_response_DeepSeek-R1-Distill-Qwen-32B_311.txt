Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's visit to Pittsburgh after the synagogue shooting. The article is pretty detailed, so I need to extract the key points without getting bogged down in the specifics.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. Trump visited the synagogue, lit candles, and there were protests against him. The visit was controversial because of his rhetoric being linked to the attack. I should note that the visit was short, about 30 minutes, and he didn't make any public statements.

Next, I need to highlight the protests. They were diverse and included people from the Jewish community. The protesters were against Trump's presence and his policies, referencing Fred Rogers as a symbol of kindness. This shows the opposition's stance.

Also, the article mentions the upcoming elections, so that's an important context. Trump's visit was just a week before the midterms, which adds political significance. Including that the visit was brief and focused on showing respect, with his family members also present, adds depth.

I should also touch on the aftermath, like the funerals and the suspect's charges. It's important to mention the national debate over Trump's rhetoric and its potential impact on the attack. This shows the broader implications of the visit.

Lastly, I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll structure it to cover Trump's visit, the protests, the political timing, and the aftermath, all while linking it to the debate over his rhetoric.

SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman, lighting candles for the 11 victims. His visit, which lasted about 30 minutes, was met with protests by thousands, including members of the Jewish community, who criticized his timing and rhetoric. Trump, accompanied by Melania, Ivanka, Jared Kushner, and Steven Mnuchin, avoided public remarks, focusing on showing respect. The visit came amid criticism that his inflammatory language may have contributed to the attack, the deadliest on American Jewry. Protesters cited Trump's tweets about migrant caravans as potentially inciting the gunman, who referenced Jewish organizations in his social media posts. The president's trip also coincided with the national elections, with his visit drawing attention to the political climate. Funerals for the victims began, and the accused gunman, Robert Bowers, faced federal charges, including hate crimes. END OF SUMMARY.
