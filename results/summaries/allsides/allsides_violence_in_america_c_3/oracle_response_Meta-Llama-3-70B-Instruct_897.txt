SUMMARY:

U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in a deadly anti-Semitic attack, sparking widespread criticism and protests. Trump lit candles for each of the victims, but his presence was met with disapproval from many, including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, who deemed the visit "ill-timed." Thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, holding signs with slogans such as "We build bridges not walls" and invoking the legacy of Fred Rogers, a beloved figure known for promoting friendship and kindness. The protesters accused Trump's inflammatory rhetoric of provoking the attack and contributing to a surge in white nationalist activity. Trump's visit came just a week before national elections, and his critics argue that his words have meaning and can lead to bloodshed. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty if convicted. END OF SUMMARY.
