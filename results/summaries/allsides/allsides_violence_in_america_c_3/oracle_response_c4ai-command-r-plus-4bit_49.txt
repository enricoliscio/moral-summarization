SUMMARY: U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue attacked by an anti-Semitic gunman that left 11 worshipers slain and six wounded. The visit, which took place a week before national elections, was met with protests as thousands believed Trump's inflammatory rhetoric may have helped provoke the attack. Despite criticism, Trump entered the Tree of Life temple, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, and lit candles for each of the victims. They then proceeded to a memorial outside the building, where they paid their respects. The first funerals for the victims were held earlier in the day, with thousands paying their respects to the slain brothers, David and Cecil Rosenthal. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, was charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty. Protest organizers and local Jewish leaders criticized Trump's rhetoric, stating that his words and tweets about migrant caravans may have contributed to provoking the attack and encouraging far-right extremists. They emphasized that Bowers' social media posts reflected anti-Semitic lies and beliefs. The visit highlighted the ongoing debate over the role of political rhetoric in inciting violence and the importance of denouncing white nationalism.
