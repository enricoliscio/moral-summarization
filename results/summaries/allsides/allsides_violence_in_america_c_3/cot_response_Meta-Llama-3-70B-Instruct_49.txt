SUMMARY:
U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshipers were slain in an anti-Semitic attack, sparking widespread criticism and protests. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has been accused of provoking the attack, and many have condemned his words as hateful and white nationalist. Despite this, Trump lit candles for each of the victims and visited wounded police officers, saying the trip was "very humbling and sad." However, thousands of protesters, including members of the Jewish community, gathered nearby, chanting slogans like "We build bridges not walls" and carrying signs invoking the late Fred Rogers' message of kindness. The visit came just a week before national elections, and critics argue that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity. END OF SUMMARY.
