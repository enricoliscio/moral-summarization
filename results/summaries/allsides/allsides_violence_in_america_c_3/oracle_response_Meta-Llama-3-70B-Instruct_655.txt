SUMMARY:

U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Pittsburgh synagogue where an anti-Semitic gunman attacked and killed 11 worshipers, sparking widespread criticism that his inflammatory rhetoric may have provoked the deadliest attack on American Jewry. Despite protests from thousands, including members of the Jewish community, Trump lit candles for each of the slain victims and placed stones on a memorial outside the temple. The president's visit was met with disapproval from congressional leaders and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, who deemed it "ill-timed." Trump's rhetoric has been accused of encouraging white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity, which critics say contributed to the surge in hate crimes. The accused gunman, Robert Bowers, was charged with 29 federal felony counts, including hate crimes, and could face the death penalty if convicted. The attack has heightened a national debate over Trump's rhetoric, with many calling on him to fully denounce white nationalism.
