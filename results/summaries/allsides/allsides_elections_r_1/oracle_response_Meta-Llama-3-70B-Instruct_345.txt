SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and aid state and local governments amidst the COVID-19 crisis. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade claims that in 1993, Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals while she was working on his Senate staff. She reported the incident to her supervisors, but her concerns were not taken seriously, and she was eventually told to find another job. Two of those staffers have denied recalling the incident, while a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. However, Reade's former neighbor has corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman believed to be Reade's mother calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience. Biden has previously acknowledged allegations of making women feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, but has denied Reade's assault claim.

END OF SUMMARY.
