SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to address the Coronavirus crisis, along with environmental initiatives and substantial aid for state and local governments. However, allegations of sexual misconduct have surfaced against Biden, with former staffer Tara Reade accusing him of sexually assaulting her in 1993. Reade claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals. She further alleges that her supervisors in Biden's office dismissed her concerns and told her to find another job. While two staffers have no recollection of the incident, a former neighbor of Reade's supports her account. Additionally, a 1993 video clip appears to support Reade's claim, in which a woman believed to be her mother calls into a TV show, describing her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator and choosing not to go to the press. Last year, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations of inappropriate displays of affection by Biden. Biden has denied Reade's accusation and the media has largely avoided questioning him on the matter.
END OF SUMMARY.
