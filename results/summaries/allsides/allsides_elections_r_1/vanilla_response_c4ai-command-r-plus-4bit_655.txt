SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed increased spending to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been facing accusations of sexual assault from a former staffer, Tara Reade, who claims that Biden assaulted her in 1993. Reade's account is supported by a former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, and a 1993 video clip of a woman, allegedly Reade's mother, calling into "Larry King Live" and describing her daughter's experience. Previously, in spring 2019, eight women, including Reade, had accused Biden of inappropriate displays of affection, to which Biden promised to be more mindful of personal space. The Biden campaign has denied Reade's assault allegation, stating that it did not happen.
END OF SUMMARY.
