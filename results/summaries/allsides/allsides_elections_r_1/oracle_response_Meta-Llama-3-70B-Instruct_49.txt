SUMMARY:

Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has unveiled a plan to tackle the Coronavirus, criticizing the Trump administration's response. His proposal includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create jobs, environmental initiatives, and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been quiet about the sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who accused him of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993. Reade claimed that after reporting the incident to her supervisors, her concerns were not taken seriously, and she was eventually told to find another job. Two staffers denied recalling the incident, while a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. However, Reade's former neighbor has come forward to support her account, stating that Reade felt assaulted and didn't know what to do. Despite this, major media outlets have not asked Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign has denied the claims, saying they "absolutely did not happen."

END OF SUMMARY.
