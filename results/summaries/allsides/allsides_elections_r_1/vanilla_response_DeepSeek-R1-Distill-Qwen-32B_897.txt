Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Biden. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Biden's coronavirus plan and his response to the allegations of sexual assault from Tara Reade.

First, the main points about his plan: he's proposing a $1 trillion infrastructure program, environmental initiatives, and aid for states. He's criticizing Trump's handling of the pandemic.

Then, the allegations: Tara Reade accused him of sexual assault in 1993. She said he groped her and touched her inappropriately. She tried to report it to his staff but wasn't taken seriously. Some staffers deny knowing her or the incident. A neighbor supports her story, and there's a 1993 video where Reade's mom mentions her daughter's issues with a prominent senator. Eight women have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with his behavior. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful.

The media hasn't asked Biden about the assault, but his campaign denied the allegations, saying they didn't happen.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Biden's economic plan, the allegations, Reade's claims, the lack of response from Biden, the staffer denials, the neighbor's support, the 1993 video, the other women's complaints, Biden's acknowledgment, and the campaign's response.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all the key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important aspect is included without exceeding the word limit.
