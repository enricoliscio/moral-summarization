SUMMARY:

Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and aid state and local governments amidst the COVID-19 crisis. However, he has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former staffer. Reade accused Biden of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993. Despite her supervisors' lack of action, Reade's former neighbor has corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing Reade's mother calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience. Biden has denied the allegations, calling them "absolutely did not happen." This is not the first time Biden has faced allegations of inappropriate behavior, as eight women previously came forward with complaints of being made to feel uncomfortable by his displays of affection. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space.

END OF SUMMARY.
