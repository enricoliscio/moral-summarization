SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and aid state and local governments, while criticizing the Trump administration's actions on COVID-19. However, Biden has been quiet about the sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who accused him of groping her and touching her genitals in 1993. Reade claimed that after reporting the incident to her supervisors, her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually told to find another job. Despite Biden's previous acknowledgment of making women feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, he has denied the assault allegations, saying they "absolutely did not happen." The allegations have sparked a debate on respecting personal space and the importance of diligently reviewing sexual assault claims. END OF SUMMARY.
