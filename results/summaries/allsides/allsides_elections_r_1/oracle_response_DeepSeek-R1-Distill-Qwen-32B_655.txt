Alright, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the list of morally framed words. My first thought is to understand the main points of the article. It's about Joe Biden's response to the Coronavirus and the sexual assault allegations against him.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key elements: Biden's infrastructure plan, the criticism of Trump's handling, and the allegations from Tara Reade. Also, I should use the specified moral words like "assault," "groped," "harassed," etc.

I should structure the summary to first mention Biden's plan, then transition into the allegations. It's important to present both sides: Reade's claims and the denials from Biden's staffers. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I have to be selective with the details.

I'll start by summarizing Biden's proposal, then introduce Reade's allegations, include the supporting statements from her neighbor and the video clip. Next, I'll mention the denials from Biden's team and the lack of media questioning. Finally, I'll note Biden's acknowledgment of past complaints and his promise to be more mindful.

I should ensure that the moral words are included where appropriate without making the summary too lengthy. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article. Also, I need to end the summary with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, emphasizing job creation, environmental programs, and aid to state and local governments. Meanwhile, Biden has remained silent on allegations from Tara Reade, a former staffer, who claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade alleges Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals, but her concerns were not taken seriously by his office. Three staffers have denied her claims, and a former neighbor supports Reade, stating she felt assaulted and powerless. A 1993 video clip suggests Reade's mother hinted at the incident, while eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. However, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign denied the claims, stating they "absolutely did not happen." END OF SUMMARY.
