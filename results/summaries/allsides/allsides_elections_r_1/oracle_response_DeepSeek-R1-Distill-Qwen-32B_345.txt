Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Joe Biden's COVID-19 plan and the sexual assault allegations against him. The author uses several morally charged words, which I need to include in the summary.

I should start by mentioning Biden's infrastructure plan and his criticism of the Trump administration. Then, move on to the allegations by Tara Reade and the reactions from Biden and others. I need to include words like "assault," "pushed," "groped," "harassed," etc., as these are part of the moral framing.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to cover all key points without going into too much detail. The summary should be clear and concise, highlighting the main events and the moral implications.

I should structure it so that the first part talks about Biden's plan, then transition into the allegations, the reactions, and the media's role. I'll make sure to mention that major outlets haven't asked Biden about the assault claims and that his campaign denies the allegations.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll double-check the word count to stay within the limit. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Let me put it all together.

SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the COVID-19 crisis, criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. However, Biden has remained quiet amid allegations of sexual assault from Tara Reade, who claims he pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993 while she worked on his Senate staff. Reade alleges her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually told to find another job. Two former staffers have denied recalling the incident, and a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. Reade's former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, supports her account, stating Reade felt assaulted and powerless. A 1993 video clip from Reade's mother corroborates the story, describing her daughter's inability to resolve her issues with Biden. Last year, eight women, including Reade, accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. Major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the assault allegations, and his campaign denied the claims, stating they "absolutely did not happen." END OF SUMMARY.
