Okay, so I need to summarize the news article about Joe Biden and the allegations against him, while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the text again.

The article talks about Biden's plan for dealing with the Coronavirus, criticizing the Trump administration. Then it shifts to the allegations from Tara Reade about sexual assault in 1993. She claims Biden groped her and touched her genitals. She reported it to supervisors, but they didn't take her seriously, and she was told to find another job. Some staffers denied her claims, and a former neighbor supports her account. There's a video clip where Reade's mother mentions her daughter's issues with a senator. Reade also mentioned being asked to dress more conservatively. Biden acknowledged complaints and promised to be more mindful. The Biden campaign denied the allegations, saying they didn't happen.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to list all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication. Let me go through the article again and pick them out.

From the first part: "criticizing," "spending," "economic crisis," "infrastructure program," "create jobs," "environmental programs," "aid." These are more about policy and not necessarily moral, but "criticizing" could be framed as a negative action.

Then, the allegations: "accused," "sexual assault," "groped," "touched her genitals," "harassed," "not taken seriously," "eventually told to find another job," "deny," "deny," "deny," "supporting," "assaulted," "problems," "diligently reviewed," "independent press," "absolutely did not happen."

So, the morally framed words are: "criticizing," "accused," "sexual assault," "groped," "touched her genitals," "harassed," "deny," "deny," "deny," "supporting," "assaulted," "problems," "diligently reviewed," "independent press," "absolutely did not happen."

Wait, maybe some of these are just descriptive. "Criticizing" is more about policy, but in the context, it's about Biden's criticism of Trump, which could have a moral angle. "Accused," "sexual assault," "groped," "touched her genitals," "harassed" are definitely moral terms. "Deny" is a factual action but in this context, it's about denying allegations, which is a moral stance. "Supporting" is positive, "assaulted" is negative. "Problems" is neutral, but in the context of harassment, it's moral. "Diligently reviewed" is about process, but "independent press" is about fairness. "Absolutely did not happen" is a denial, so it's a moral assertion.

I think I've got the list. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while making it concise. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be brief but cover all the key points: Biden's plan, the allegations, Reade's claims, the responses, and the Biden campaign's denial.

I'll structure it by first mentioning Biden's plan, then the allegations, Reade's account, the denial from staffers and the campaign, and the supporting statements. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

Let me try to draft it:

"Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the Coronavirus economic crisis, criticizing the Trump administration's handling. However, he has remained quiet on allegations from Tara Reade, who accused him of sexual assault in 1993. Reade claims Biden groped her and touched her genitals, but his staffers denied the claims. A former neighbor supports Reade's account. The Biden campaign dismissed the allegations, stating they 'absolutely did not happen.' Eight women previously accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior, which he acknowledged, promising to be more mindful."

I think that covers the main points and includes the morally framed words. Let me check the word count. It's 110 words, so well within the limit. I should ensure all key elements are included: the plan, the accusation, the denial, the support, and the previous allegations.
