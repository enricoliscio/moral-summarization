SUMMARY:
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, is proposing his own strategy for dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic while criticizing the Trump administration's actions. Biden is calling for increased spending, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create American jobs and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has remained quiet regarding a recent accusation of sexual assault from a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade alleged that Biden groped her and touched her genitals in 1993, and when she reported her concerns to Biden's office, they were not taken seriously. Reade's account is supported by a former neighbor who recalls her detailing the alleged incident in the 1990s. Last year, several women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to respect personal space in the future. Biden's campaign has denied Reade's recent accusation, stating that while sexual assault claims should be reviewed diligently, the alleged incident did not happen.
