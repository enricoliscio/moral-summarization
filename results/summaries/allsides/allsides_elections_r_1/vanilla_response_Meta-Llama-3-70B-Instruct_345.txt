SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled his plan to tackle the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs and provide massive aid to state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade accuses Biden of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993 while she was working on his Senate staff. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, saying they "absolutely did not happen." Despite this, Reade's former neighbor has come forward to support her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman, allegedly Reade's mother, calling into a CNN show to discuss her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator. The allegations have not been pursued by major media outlets, with Biden's campaign pointing to a previous statement that such claims should be reviewed by an independent press.

END OF SUMMARY.
