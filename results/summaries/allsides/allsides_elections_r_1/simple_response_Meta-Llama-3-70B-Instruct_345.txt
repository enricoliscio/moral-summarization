SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to combat the Coronavirus, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program, environmental initiatives, and aid for state and local governments. However, his campaign has been marred by allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade accuses Biden of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993 while she worked on his Senate staff. Despite Biden's previous acknowledgment of inappropriate behavior towards women, his campaign has denied Reade's allegations, pointing to a lack of corroboration from other staffers. However, a former neighbor has come forward to support Reade's account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman, allegedly Reade's mother, calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator. The allegations raise questions about Biden's character and his commitment to respecting women's personal space.
