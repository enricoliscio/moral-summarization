SUMMARY: 
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, is offering his own plan for dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic, criticizing the Trump administration's actions and calling for increased spending. Meanwhile, Biden has been quiet about a sexual assault allegation made by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who accused him of inappropriate behavior in 1993. Reade claims that Biden groped her and that her concerns about sexual harassment were not taken seriously by his office. Two of Biden's former staffers have denied the incident, while a third and Reade's former neighbor are supporting her account. Last year, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations of inappropriate displays of affection by Biden. He promised to respect personal space but has not addressed the recent sexual assault allegation. The Biden campaign denied the charge, stating that such behavior "absolutely did not happen."
END OF SUMMARY.
