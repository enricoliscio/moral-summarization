Alright, so I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Joe Biden's coronavirus plan and the sexual assault allegations against him. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "criticizing," "accused," "sexual assault," "harassed," "deny," "supporting," "problems," "inappropriate," "respect," "independent," and "absolutely" seem to carry moral weight. I'll list these as STEP 1.

Next, I have to write a concise summary. I'll mention Biden's infrastructure plan and his criticism of Trump. Then, I'll address the allegations, Reade's claims, the lack of response from Biden's office, the staffers' denials, and the support from Reade's neighbor. I'll also note the 1993 video and the other eight women's allegations. Finally, I'll include the Biden campaign's response. I need to keep it under 200 words and include the moral terms identified.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without going into too much detail. I'll start by introducing Biden's plan, then move to the allegations, the reactions, and the campaign's response. I'll ensure that the morally charged words are included to maintain the original framing.

Let me put it all together. Make sure each sentence is clear and concise, and that the summary captures the essence of the article while highlighting the moral aspects.

**SUMMARY:**

Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the economic impact of the Coronavirus, while criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the crisis. However, Biden has remained silent on allegations of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former staffer, who claims he groped her in 1993. Reade alleges that after reporting the incident, her concerns were dismissed, and she was pressured to leave her job. Biden's staffers and a former neighbor have denied or supported Reade's claims, respectively. A 1993 video clip involving Reade's mother corroborates her account. Additionally, eight women have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden has acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. However, major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the allegations, and his campaign has denied Reade's claims, stating they "absolutely did not happen." END OF SUMMARY.
