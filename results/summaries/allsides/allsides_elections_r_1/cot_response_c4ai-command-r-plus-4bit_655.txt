SUMMARY:
Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is offering his own plan for dealing with the Coronavirus while criticizing the Trump administration's actions. He proposes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and calls for massive spending to address the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by recent accusations of sexual misconduct. Tara Reade, a former staffer, has publicly accused Biden of sexual assault, alleging that he groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade claims that when she reported the incident to Biden's office, her concerns were not taken seriously, and she was eventually dismissed. While two former staffers deny Reade's account, a former neighbor supports her claim, stating that Reade felt assaulted and disempowered. Last year, Reade was among several women who came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Biden, who later promised to be more mindful of respecting personal space. Biden's campaign has denied the sexual assault charge, stating that while such claims should be diligently reviewed, the alleged incident with Reade absolutely did not occur.
END OF SUMMARY.
