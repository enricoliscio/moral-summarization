SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and stimulate the economy in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, while also promising massive aid for state and local governments. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by recent allegations of sexual assault by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who claims that Biden groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's account is supported by a former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, and a 1993 video clip of a woman believed to be Reade's mother calling into a TV show and describing her daughter's experience. Despite this, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the allegation, and his campaign has denied the charge. Last year, Biden was accused by multiple women of inappropriate displays of affection, which he acknowledged and promised to be more mindful of in the future.
