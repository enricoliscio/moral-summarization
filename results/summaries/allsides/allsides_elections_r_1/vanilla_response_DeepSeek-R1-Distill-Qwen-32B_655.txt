Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Biden. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about two main things: Biden's plan to deal with the Coronavirus and some allegations against him from a former staffer.

First, Biden is offering a plan that includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program, environmental programs, and aid for state and local governments. He's criticizing Trump's handling of the pandemic. That's one part.

Then, there's the part about Tara Reade accusing Biden of sexual assault back in 1993. She says he groped her and touched her genitals. She reported it to his office, but they didn't take her seriously, and she had to leave her job. Some staffers don't remember her or the incident, and one denied it. A neighbor supports her claim, saying Reade told her about it in the mid-90s. There's also a video from 1993 where Reade's mom mentions her daughter leaving Washington because of problems with a senator. Eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with his behavior. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful. The media hasn't asked him about the assault, but the Biden campaign denies the allegations.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include both Biden's policy plan and the allegations, along with the responses from Biden and his campaign. I should make sure to mention the key points: the infrastructure plan, the accusation details, the lack of response from Biden, the staffers' denials, the neighbor's support, the 1993 video, the other allegations from eight women, Biden's acknowledgment, and the campaign's denial.

I have to structure it clearly, maybe starting with Biden's plan, then moving into the allegations, and ending with the responses and denials. I should keep it concise, avoiding unnecessary details but covering all main points.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to ensure it's under 200 words. Maybe start with "Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan..." then mention the criticism of Trump. Then introduce the allegations, Reade's claims, the lack of response, the staffers' denials, the neighbor's support, the video, the eight women, Biden's acknowledgment, and the campaign's denial.

I should also make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without getting too bogged down in specifics. Maybe mention that major media hasn't asked Biden about the assault, highlighting the contrast between the allegations and the campaign's response.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and covers all necessary points.
