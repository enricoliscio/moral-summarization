SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs, alongside environmental programs and financial aid for state and local governments as a means of addressing the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by sexual assault allegations made by former staffer Tara Reade, who accused him of inappropriate behavior and assault during her time in his Senate office in 1993. Reade's claims have been supported by a former neighbor, and a 1993 video clip of a woman believed to be her mother calling into a TV show, detailing her daughter's negative experience working for a "prominent senator." Despite this, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the allegations, and his campaign has denied the charge. Last year, Biden acknowledged similar complaints of inappropriate behavior from multiple women and promised to be more respectful of personal space, but Reade's accusation of assault has not been addressed. This raises moral concerns about the treatment of sexual assault allegations, the potential abuse of power, and the responsibility of the media in holding public figures accountable. 

END OF SUMMARY.
