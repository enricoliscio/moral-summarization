SUMMARY:

Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has unveiled his plan to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs and provide massive aid to state and local governments. However, Biden's campaign has been marred by allegations of sexual assault by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993. Despite Reade's accusations, Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, and major media outlets have failed to press Biden on the issue. The moral implications of this situation are clear: a politician who is seeking to lead the country has been accused of a serious crime, and yet, he and his campaign have chosen to dismiss and downplay the allegations rather than taking responsibility and accountability. This raises questions about Biden's character and fitness for office.
