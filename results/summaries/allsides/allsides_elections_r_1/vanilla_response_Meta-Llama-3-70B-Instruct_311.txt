SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled his plan to tackle the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs, environmental initiatives, and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993 while she was working on his Senate staff. Two of Biden's former staffers have denied Reade's claims, but a former neighbor has come forward to support Reade's account. Despite this, major media outlets have not pressed Biden on the allegations, and his campaign has denied the claims, stating that they "absolutely did not happen."

END OF SUMMARY.
