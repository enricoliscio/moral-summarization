Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Joe Biden's Coronavirus plan and the sexual assault allegations against him. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Biden is offering a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and criticizing Trump's handling of COVID-19. Then, there are allegations from Tara Reade about sexual assault in 1993. Some staffers deny the incident, and a former neighbor supports Reade's account. There's also a video clip from 1993 where Reade's mother mentioned her daughter's issues with a senator. Additionally, eight women have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden acknowledged this and promised to be more mindful. The Biden campaign denies the assault allegations.

Now, I need to summarize this concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I should include both Biden's plan and the allegations, highlighting the moral issues involved. I'll structure it by first mentioning Biden's plan, then the allegations, and the responses from both Reade and the Biden campaign. I need to ensure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include the impact on Reade and the broader implications for Biden's candidacy.

I should also mention that major media hasn't asked Biden about the allegations, showing the ongoing tension. I'll make sure to keep the summary balanced, presenting both sides without taking a stance.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with Biden's infrastructure plan, then move to the allegations, Reade's account, the denial from staffers, the neighbor's support, the 1993 video, the other eight women's allegations, Biden's acknowledgment, and the campaign's response. I'll end with the media's approach to the issue.

I should double-check that I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the facts with the moral implications as presented. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the economic impact of COVID-19, while criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. However, Biden has remained silent on allegations from Tara Reade, a former staffer, who claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade alleges Biden groped her and touched her genitals in a Capitol Hill office building, and that her concerns were dismissed by his staff. Two staffers have denied the incident, and a former neighbor supports Reade's account. A 1993 video clip features Reade's mother indirectly referring to her daughter's issues with a senator. Additionally, eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. The Biden campaign has denied the assault allegations, stating they "absolutely did not happen." Major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the claims, highlighting the ongoing tension surrounding the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
