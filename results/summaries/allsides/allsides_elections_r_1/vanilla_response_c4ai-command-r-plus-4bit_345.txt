SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has criticized the Trump administration's response to the Coronavirus pandemic and proposed his own plan, which includes increased spending on infrastructure and aid for state and local governments. Separately, Biden has been accused by a former staffer, Tara Reade, of sexual assault in 1993. Reade claims that Biden groped her and penetrated her with his fingers. She also alleges that her supervisors in Biden's office did not take her concerns seriously. Two of Biden's former staffers have denied Reade's claim, while a third has no recollection of the incident. A former neighbor of Reade's has corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip has emerged that appears to support Reade's allegations. Last year, Biden acknowledged complaints from several women who felt uncomfortable with his displays of affection, but he has not addressed Reade's accusation of sexual assault.
END OF SUMMARY.
