SUMMARY: 
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has been criticized for his handling of the Coronavirus pandemic and has proposed increased spending to address the crisis, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has faced moral scrutiny due to sexual misconduct allegations made by former staffer Tara Reade. Reade accused Biden of sexual assault, claiming that he groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. She further alleged that when she reported the incident to Biden's office, her concerns were not taken seriously. While two staffers denied knowledge of the incident, Reade's former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, supported her account. Last year, Reade was one of eight women who came forward with complaints about Biden's inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged these earlier complaints and promised to respect personal space, but he has not addressed Reade's more recent allegation of sexual assault. The Biden campaign denied the charge, stating that while sexual assault claims should be diligently reviewed, the alleged incident with Reade did not occur. 
END OF SUMMARY.
