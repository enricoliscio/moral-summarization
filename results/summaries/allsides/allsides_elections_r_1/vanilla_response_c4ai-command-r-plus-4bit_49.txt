SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to boost the economy amid the Coronavirus crisis, alongside environmental initiatives and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has faced criticism for his silence on sexual assault allegations made by former staffer Tara Reade, who accused him of inappropriate behavior in 1993. Reade claims that Biden groped her and touched her genitals, and that her complaints to supervisors were ignored. While two former staffers denied the incident, a third supported Reade's account, and a former neighbor also corroborated her story. A 1993 video clip has also emerged, appearing to support Reade's claim. Previously, Biden acknowledged complaints of inappropriate behavior from multiple women and promised to be more mindful of personal space. However, major media outlets have not pressed Biden on the recent allegation, and his campaign has denied the accusation.
END OF SUMMARY.
