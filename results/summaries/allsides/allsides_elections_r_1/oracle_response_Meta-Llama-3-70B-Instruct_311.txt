SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to combat the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs, environmental initiatives, and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his silence on the allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade accuses Biden of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993. She claims that after reporting the incident to her supervisors, her concerns were not taken seriously, and she was eventually told to find another job. Two of those staffers have denied recalling Reade or the incident, while a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. However, Reade's former neighbor has come forward to support her account, stating that Reade felt assaulted and didn't know what to do. Despite previous allegations of making women feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, Biden has denied the assault allegations, saying they "absolutely did not happen."

END OF SUMMARY.
