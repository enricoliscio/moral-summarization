SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to tackle the Coronavirus, criticizing the Trump administration's response. His proposal includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create jobs and aid state and local governments. However, Biden has been silent about the sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who claims he groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's account has been supported by her former neighbor, who corroborated the alleged incident. Despite this, Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, saying they "absolutely did not happen." The incident has raised questions about Biden's respect for personal space, as eight women previously accused him of making them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden had promised to be "more mindful" in the future. The media has been criticized for not asking Biden about the alleged assault, with some outlets pointing to a previous statement that sexual assault claims should be "diligently reviewed by an independent press."
