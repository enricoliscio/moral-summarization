Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Joe Biden. Let me read through the article first to get the main points. 

Okay, the article talks about Biden's plan to deal with the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program and aid for states. But then it shifts to the sexual assault allegations from Tara Reade. She claims Biden groped her in 1993, and some staffers don't remember the incident. There's also a mention of a 1993 video where Reade's mom hinted at her leaving her job because of issues with a senator. Plus, eight women have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable, and he's acknowledged that, promising to be more mindful. The Biden campaign denies the assault allegations.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Biden's coronavirus plan, then transition to the allegations. I should include Reade's claims, the reactions from staffers, the video clip, and the broader context of other women's complaints. Also, note that major media hasn't questioned Biden about this yet. 

I should structure it clearly, maybe in two paragraphs: one about the policy and the other about the allegations. Keep each point brief but informative. Make sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed. 

Let me check the word count. Hmm, I think I can condense it without losing essential info. Make sure to mention the 1993 incident, the staffers' denials, the video, and the broader context of the eight women. Also, note Biden's response and the campaign's denial. 

Okay, I think that's a solid summary. It covers both his policy stance and the allegations, providing a balanced overview without bias. I'll make sure it's under 200 words and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the economic impact of COVID-19, including job creation, environmental programs, and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has not addressed recent allegations from Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, who claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade alleges Biden groped her and touched her genitals in a Capitol Hill office, but his former staffers have denied the incident. Reade’s neighbor corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip suggests Reade’s mother hinted at the issue during a TV interview. Additionally, eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden acknowledged these complaints in 2019, promising to be more mindful of personal space. The Biden campaign denies the assault allegations, stating they "absolutely did not happen." Major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the claims. END OF SUMMARY.
