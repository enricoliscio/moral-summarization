SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create jobs and aid state and local governments amidst the COVID-19 crisis. However, he has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by former staffer Tara Reade. Reade accuses Biden of pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals in 1993. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, and some of Reade's former colleagues have stated they don't recall the incident. However, Reade's former neighbor has corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman believed to be Reade's mother calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator. Biden has previously acknowledged making women feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, but major media outlets have not pressed him on the alleged assault.

END OF SUMMARY.
