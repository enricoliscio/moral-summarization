SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs, along with environmental programs and massive aid for state and local governments as part of his plan to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic. However, Biden has been facing criticism for his silence on allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade has publicly accused Biden of sexually harassing her and assaulting her in 1993, pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals. Reade also claims that when she reported the incident to Biden's office, her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually told to leave. While two former staffers have denied knowledge of the incident, Reade's former neighbor and a 1993 video clip support her account. Last year, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations of inappropriate displays of affection by Biden. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to respect personal space, but major media outlets have not pressed him on Reade's more recent and serious charge of sexual assault. 

END OF SUMMARY.
