SUMMARY:
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has unveiled his plan to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been quiet about the sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who claims he groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's account has been supported by her former neighbor, who corroborated the alleged incident. Despite this, Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, stating that they "absolutely did not happen." This comes after eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, which he acknowledged and promised to be "more mindful" about in the future. Major media outlets have not pressed Biden on the alleged assault, raising questions about accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
