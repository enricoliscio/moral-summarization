SUMMARY:

Presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to combat the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs and provide aid to state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993 while she was working on his Senate staff. Despite Biden's denial of the allegations, Reade's former neighbor has come forward to support her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman believed to be Reade's mother calling into a CNN show to discuss her daughter's experience. Biden has faced previous allegations of inappropriate behavior, but has not been asked about the alleged assault by major media outlets.

END OF SUMMARY.
