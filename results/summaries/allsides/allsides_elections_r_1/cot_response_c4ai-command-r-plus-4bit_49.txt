SUMMARY: 
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, is proposing increased spending to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic while criticizing the Trump administration's response. Biden calls for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs, alongside environmental initiatives and substantial aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has remained quiet about a recent accusation of sexual assault by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade alleges that in 1993, Biden groped her and touched her genitals. She claims that when she reported the incident to Biden's office, her concerns were not taken seriously. Two former staffers denied Reade's claim, while a third and Reade's former neighbor supported her account. Last year, Reade was among eight women who came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Biden, making them feel uncomfortable. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more respectful of personal space. The Biden campaign denied Reade's recent accusation, stating that while sexual assault claims should be reviewed independently, the alleged incident did not occur. 
END OF SUMMARY.
