SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed increased spending to address COVID-19, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program, environmental initiatives, and substantial aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has faced criticism for his silence regarding sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer. Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, but her claims have been denied by two former staffers and partially disputed by a third. A former neighbor of Reade's has supported her account, and a 1993 video clip has emerged that appears to support her claims. Biden previously acknowledged complaints of inappropriate behavior from multiple women and promised to be more mindful of personal space, but he has not addressed Reade's assault allegation directly.
END OF SUMMARY.
