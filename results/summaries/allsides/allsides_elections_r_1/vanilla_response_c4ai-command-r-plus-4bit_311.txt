SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has outlined his plan for addressing the Coronavirus pandemic, which includes increased spending and a focus on job creation through infrastructure programs and environmental initiatives. He has also proposed providing significant aid to state and local governments. Separately, Biden has been facing allegations of sexual assault by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who claims that he assaulted her in 1993. Reade's account has been partially supported by a former neighbor, and a recently discovered video clip from 1993 appears to support her claim. Last year, eight women, including Reade, accused Biden of inappropriate behavior, to which he responded by promising to be more mindful of personal space. Major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the sexual assault allegation, and his campaign has denied the claim.
END OF SUMMARY.
