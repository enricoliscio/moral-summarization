SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to tackle the Coronavirus, including a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993. Despite Biden's denial, Reade's former neighbor has corroborated her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman believed to be Reade's mother calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience. Biden has previously acknowledged allegations of inappropriate displays of affection, promising to be "more respectful" of personal space in the future. However, major media outlets have not pressed Biden on the alleged assault, and his campaign has dismissed the claim as "absolutely" false. END OF SUMMARY.
