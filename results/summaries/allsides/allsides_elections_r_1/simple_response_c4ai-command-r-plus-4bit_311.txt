SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and stimulate the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, pushing her against a wall, groping her, and touching her genitals. She also claimed that her supervisors in Biden's office did not take her concerns seriously and told her to find another job. While two of Biden's staffers have no recollection of the incident, Reade's account is supported by a former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse. Additionally, a 1993 video clip has surfaced, featuring a woman believed to be Reade's mother, calling into a TV show and alluding to her daughter's negative experience working for a prominent senator. Previously, Reade was one of eight women who came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Biden, who promised to be more mindful of personal space. Despite the seriousness of the allegations, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign has denied the charge.

END OF SUMMARY.
