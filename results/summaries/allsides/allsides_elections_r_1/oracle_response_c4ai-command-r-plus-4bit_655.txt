SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to address the Coronavirus crisis and create new American jobs, alongside environmental programs and aid for state and local governments. However, he has been criticized for his silence on sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer. Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, claiming he pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals. She also said that when she reported the incident to Biden's office, her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually dismissed. While two former staffers denied the incident, Reade's former neighbor and a 1993 video clip support her account. Last year, Reade was among eight women who came forward with allegations of inappropriate displays of affection by Biden. He acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. Despite this, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign has denied the charge.
END OF SUMMARY.
