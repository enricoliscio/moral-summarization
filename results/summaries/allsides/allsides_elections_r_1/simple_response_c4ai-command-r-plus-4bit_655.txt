SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs and aid state and local governments as a way to address the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. However, his response to the pandemic has been overshadowed by allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, and her account has been supported by a former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse. Despite this, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the allegation, and his campaign has denied the charge. Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Biden, which he acknowledged and promised to respect personal space in the future. This recent allegation raises serious moral concerns about Biden's conduct and the media's responsibility to hold public figures accountable for their actions. It also highlights the ongoing challenge of addressing sexual assault and harassment in politics and the workplace.
