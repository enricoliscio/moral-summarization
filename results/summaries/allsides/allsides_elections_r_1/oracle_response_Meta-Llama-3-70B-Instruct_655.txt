SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs and aid state and local governments, criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. However, Biden has remained quiet about allegations of sexual assault made by former staffer Tara Reade, who claims he pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's concerns were allegedly ignored by Biden's office, and she was eventually told to find another job. Two former staffers have denied recalling the incident, while a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. However, Reade's former neighbor has corroborated her account, stating that Reade felt "assaulted" and didn't know what to do. Biden had previously acknowledged making women feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, but has denied Reade's allegations, saying they "absolutely did not happen."

END OF SUMMARY.
