Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Joe Biden, who's the likely Democratic presidential nominee. He's talking about his plan to deal with the Coronavirus, criticizing the Trump administration. His plan includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program, environmental programs, and aid for state and local governments. That's the first part.

Then, the article shifts to some serious allegations. A former staffer, Tara Reade, accused Biden of sexual assault in 1993. She claims he groped her and touched her genitals in a Capitol Hill office. She also says her concerns weren't taken seriously and she was told to find another job. Some staffers deny knowing her or the incident. A neighbor supports her, saying Reade told her about the assault. There's also a 1993 video where Reade's mom mentions her daughter couldn't resolve her issues in Washington.

Additionally, eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden acknowledged this and promised to be more mindful. The Biden campaign has denied the assault claims, pointing to a previous statement.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Biden's Coronavirus plan and his response to the allegations, mentioning the accuser's claims, the lack of response from Biden, and the denial from his campaign. I'll make sure to cover all key points without getting too detailed.
