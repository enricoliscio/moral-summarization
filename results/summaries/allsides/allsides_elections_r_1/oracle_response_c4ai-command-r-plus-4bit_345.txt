SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to deal with the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus outbreak, along with additional spending on environmental programs and aid for state and local governments. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by allegations of sexual misconduct. Tara Reade, a former staffer, has accused Biden of sexual assault, claiming that he pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade says she reported the incident to her supervisors at the time, but her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually forced out of her job. While two of the supervisors said they didn't recall Reade or the incident, a third denied her claim. A former neighbor of Reade's has corroborated her account, saying that Reade felt assaulted and believed she had no recourse. Additionally, a 1993 video clip has emerged in which a woman, allegedly Reade's mother, calls into a TV show and describes her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator, saying she felt she couldn't speak out. Last year, Reade was one of eight women who came forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Biden, who promised to be more mindful of personal space. However, major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign has denied the charge.
END OF SUMMARY.
