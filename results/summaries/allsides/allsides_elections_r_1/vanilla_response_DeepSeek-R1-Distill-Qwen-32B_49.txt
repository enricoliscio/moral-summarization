Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Joe Biden. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about two main things: Biden's plan for dealing with the Coronavirus and some allegations against him.

First, Biden is offering his own plan, criticizing Trump's actions. He wants a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create jobs, environmental programs, and aid for state and local governments. That's his economic approach during the crisis.

Then, there's the part about Tara Reade accusing him of sexual assault in 1993. She says he groped her and touched her inappropriately. She tried to report it but wasn't taken seriously and lost her job. Some staffers deny knowing about this, and a neighbor supports her claim. There's also a video from 1993 where a woman, possibly her mom, mentions her leaving Washington because of problems with a senator, which Reade says is Biden.

Additionally, eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate behavior. Biden acknowledged this and promised to be more mindful. The article mentions that major media hasn't asked Biden about the assault, but the Biden campaign denies the allegations.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include both his policy plan and the allegations, as well as the responses from Biden and his campaign. I'll structure it to first mention his plan, then the allegations, and then the denials and responses. Make sure to keep it clear and factual without bias.
