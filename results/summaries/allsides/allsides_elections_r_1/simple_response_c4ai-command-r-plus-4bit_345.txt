SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs and stimulate the economy amid the Coronavirus pandemic, while also promising massive aid for state and local governments. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who claims that Biden groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's account is supported by a former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, who recalls Reade detailing the incident to her in the mid-90s. Additionally, a 1993 video clip from CNN's "Larry King Live" features a woman Reade identifies as her mother calling in to discuss her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator and feeling unable to address her problems. Previously, in spring 2019, eight women, including Reade, had accused Biden of inappropriate displays of affection, leading him to acknowledge the complaints and promise to be more respectful of personal space. Despite the seriousness of the allegations, major media outlets have not pressed Biden on the issue, and his campaign has denied Reade's charge, emphasizing the need for independent press review of such claims.
END OF SUMMARY.
