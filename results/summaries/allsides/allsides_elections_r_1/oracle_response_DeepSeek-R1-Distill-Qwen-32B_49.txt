Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the list of morally framed words to include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Joe Biden's coronavirus plan and his response to the allegations of sexual assault from Tara Reade. It's important to highlight the moral issues here, so I should focus on the allegations and the reactions. The user wants the summary to include specific words like "assault," "groped," "harassed," etc.

I'll start by summarizing Biden's plan briefly, then move on to the allegations. I need to mention Reade's claims, the lack of response from Biden's office, the denial from staffers, and the support from her neighbor. Also, the mention of the video clip and the other women's allegations should be included.

I have to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll structure it to first present Biden's plan, then shift to the allegations, and conclude with the current situation regarding the claims.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. It's crucial to present both sides: Reade's accusations and the denials from Biden's camp. Also, note that major media hasn't questioned Biden about this yet.

Let me make sure to include all the key points without going over the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and that the moral framing is preserved through the use of the specified words.

SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to address the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus, emphasizing job creation, environmental initiatives, and aid for state and local governments. Meanwhile, Biden has remained silent on allegations from Tara Reade, a former staffer, who claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade alleges Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals during her time on his Senate staff. She claims her concerns were not taken seriously and she was eventually forced to leave her job. Three staffers have denied the incident, with one issuing a formal denial. Reade's former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, supports her account, stating Reade felt assaulted and powerless. A 1993 video clip allegedly involving Reade's mother supports her claims, with the mother stating her daughter left Washington due to unresolved issues with a prominent senator. Additionally, eight women, including Reade, have accused Biden of making them uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged these complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. However, the Biden campaign has denied the assault allegations, stating they "absolutely did not happen." Major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the claims. END OF SUMMARY.
