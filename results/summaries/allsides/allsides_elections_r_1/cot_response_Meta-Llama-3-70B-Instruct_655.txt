SUMMARY:
Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to tackle the Coronavirus, criticizing the Trump administration's response. His proposal includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create jobs and aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been quiet about the sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade, a former staffer who claims he groped her and touched her genitals in 1993. Reade's account is supported by her former neighbor, who says Reade felt assaulted and didn't know what to do. Despite previous allegations of inappropriate displays of affection, Biden has denied the assault claim, saying it "absolutely did not happen." The Biden campaign has pointed to a previous statement saying such claims should be "diligently reviewed" by an independent press. The allegations have raised questions about Biden's respect for personal space and his commitment to being more mindful of it in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
