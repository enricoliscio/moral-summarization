SUMMARY: Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program to address the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. However, his campaign has been overshadowed by sexual assault allegations made by a former staffer, Tara Reade, who accused him of inappropriate displays of affection and assault in 1993. Reade said that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals. She also stated that her supervisors in Biden's office dismissed her concerns and told her to find another job. While two of Biden's staffers denied recalling Reade or the incident, a former neighbor of Reade's supported her account. Additionally, a 1993 video clip surfaced of a woman, believed to be Reade's mother, calling into a TV show and describing her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator and choosing not to go to the press out of respect. Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with similar allegations against Biden, who acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful. Despite this, major media outlets have not directly questioned Biden about the alleged assault, and his campaign has denied the charge.
END OF SUMMARY.
