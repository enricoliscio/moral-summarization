Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Joe Biden's response to the Coronavirus and the allegations against him. The user provided a list of morally framed words like "assault," "pushed," "groped," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll outline the main sections: Biden's plan for COVID-19 and the sexual assault allegations. I should mention the infrastructure program and the criticism of the Trump administration. Then, I'll move on to the allegations, making sure to include the specific actions like "pushed," "groped," and "touched."

I also need to note the reactions from Biden's former staffers and the support from Reade's neighbor. Including the mention of the video clip and the eight women's allegations is important. Finally, I should address Biden's response and the lack of media questioning.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral tone. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is concise and includes the necessary moral language.

I should also check that I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the facts as presented. Making sure all the key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it now, keeping each section brief and focused on the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. However, Biden has remained silent on allegations from former staffer Tara Reade, who claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade alleges Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals while she was working on his Senate staff. She claims her concerns were not taken seriously, and she was eventually told to find another job. Two of Biden's former staffers have denied knowledge of the incident, while a third issued a statement denying Reade's claim. Reade's former neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, has supported her account, stating Reade felt assaulted and powerless. A 1993 video clip surfaced, showing Reade's mother discussing her daughter's experience working for Biden. Reade also alleged Biden made her feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection, such as rubbing her shoulders and playing with her hair. Eight women, including Reade, have come forward with similar allegations. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be more mindful of personal space. The Biden campaign has denied the assault allegations, stating they "absolutely did not happen." Major media outlets have not questioned Biden about the claims. END OF SUMMARY.
