SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has unveiled his plan to tackle the Coronavirus, which includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new jobs, environmental initiatives, and massive aid for state and local governments. However, Biden has been criticized for his response to allegations of sexual assault made by a former staffer, Tara Reade. Reade claims that Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her, and touched her genitals in 1993 while she was working on his Senate staff. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations, stating that they "absolutely did not happen." Despite this, Reade's former neighbor has come forward to corroborate her account, and a 1993 video clip has surfaced showing a woman, allegedly Reade's mother, calling into CNN's "Larry King Live" to discuss her daughter's experience working for a prominent senator. The allegations have sparked controversy, with many calling for Biden to address the issue more directly.

END OF SUMMARY.
