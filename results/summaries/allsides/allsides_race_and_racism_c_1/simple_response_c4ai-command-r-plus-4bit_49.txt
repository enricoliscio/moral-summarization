SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. Lewis is remembered for his courageous leadership in the face of racial discrimination, particularly in the events leading up to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and a violent confrontation, Lewis bravely stood his ground, even as he was beaten and suffered a fractured skull. His actions, along with those of his fellow activists, shone a light on the brutality of segregation and helped bring about meaningful change. Lewis continued to fight for equality throughout his life, eventually serving in Congress. His legacy serves as an enduring reminder of the power of moral courage and the importance of standing up against injustice. Lewis' famous words, "Speak up, speak out, get in the way," inspire us to follow in his footsteps and continue the fight for equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
