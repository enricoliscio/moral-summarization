SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. The ensuing confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis stood motionless, with his hands in his pockets, as the troopers advanced, wearing gas masks. The violence was sanctioned by segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace, who had vowed "segregation forever." Lewis's bravery and message of freedom propelled him to a global stage. In his final years, Lewis urged people to "speak up, speak out, get in the way" and "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." Lewis's legacy will continue to inspire generations to fight against racism and segregation. END OF SUMMARY.
