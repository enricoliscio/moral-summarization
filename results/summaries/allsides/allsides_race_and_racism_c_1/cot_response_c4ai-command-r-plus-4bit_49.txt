SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, died at the age of 80. He is remembered for his courageous stand against racial discrimination and his pivotal role in the Selma march of 1965. On that day, Lewis and fellow activists faced a brutal confrontation with Alabama state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which became known as Bloody Sunday. Despite the segregationist governor's refusal to meet with the demonstrators and the violent response from authorities, Lewis remained steadfast in his commitment to freedom and equality. Lewis's unwavering determination propelled him onto the global stage as a hero of the civil rights movement, and his actions helped lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Even in his later years, Lewis continued to inspire others to speak up and get into "necessary trouble" for the redemption of America's soul. His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of moral courage in the face of injustice and the enduring struggle for racial equality. END OF SUMMARY.
