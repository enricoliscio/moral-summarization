Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about his role in the civil rights movement, specifically the march in Selma, Alabama in 1965. 

He was a leader of the march that was violently attacked by state troopers, which became known as Bloody Sunday. This event led to the Voting Rights Act. The article mentions his fractured skull and how he continued to fight for civil rights, eventually becoming a congressman. 

I should include key points: the march in Selma, the violence from troopers, the impact on the Voting Rights Act, his later life and death, and his message about speaking up. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise.

Let me structure it: start with his death, mention the 1965 march, the violence, the outcome with the Voting Rights Act, his career in Congress, and his final message. Make sure to highlight his perseverance and the legacy he left.

I should also note that he was a prominent figure, so his passing is significant. Maybe mention the impact of the event on the nation and how it led to important legislation. 

I need to avoid too many details, just the essentials. Let me make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main points without being too wordy.
