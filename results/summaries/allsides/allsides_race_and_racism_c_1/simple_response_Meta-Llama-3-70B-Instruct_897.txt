SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80 on July 17, 2020. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to fight for racial equality, leading to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courage and conviction inspired a nation, and his message of "getting in good trouble" and "redeeming the soul of America" continues to resonate today. The infamous Bloody Sunday, where Lewis was attacked, was a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement, and Lewis's unwavering commitment to justice and equality remains a powerful moral example. His legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up against oppression and fighting for human rights.
