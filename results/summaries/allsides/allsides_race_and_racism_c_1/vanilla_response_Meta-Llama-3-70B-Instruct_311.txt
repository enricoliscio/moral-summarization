SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights leader, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. The event, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, then 25, was undeterred by the presence of troopers and continued to lead the march, despite being warned to stop. He was hit in the head with a nightstick, fracturing his skull. The violence shocked the nation, and Lewis's bravery propelled him to a global stage as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. Lewis went on to serve in Congress and continued to advocate for civil rights until his death. He outlived other key players in the movement, including Gov. George C. Wallace, Maj. John Cloud, and Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr.
