Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts with a photo from 1965 of John Lewis being attacked by a state trooper during the civil rights march in Selma. It mentions that Lewis died in 2020. The main event is the march on March 7, 1965, where Lewis led hundreds of marchers towards the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They were met by state troopers, who attacked them, leading to the Voting Rights Act.

The article details the confrontation, the violence, and the impact it had. It also talks about the aftermath, Lewis's continued activism, and mentions other key figures who were involved.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key moral points: the peaceful protest, the violent response, the significance of the Voting Rights Act, and Lewis's legacy as a hero. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I'll start by introducing Lewis and the event, then describe the confrontation, the outcome, and conclude with his legacy. Make sure to mention the moral aspects like the fight against racial discrimination and the importance of the Voting Rights Act.

Let me draft that, keeping it concise and within the word limit.
