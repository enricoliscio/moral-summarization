Okay, I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about John Lewis's role in the civil rights movement, specifically the 1965 march in Selma where he was attacked by state troopers. This event led to the Voting Rights Act.

I should start by identifying key events and the moral terms associated with them. The march was peaceful, but met with state-sanctioned violence. Terms like "voting," "fractured," "struggle," "racial," "illegal," "violence," "brutality," "clubbed," "teargassed," etc., are important.

I need to structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects: the peaceful intent versus the violent response, the impact on the movement, and the legacy of John Lewis.

I should mention the confrontation on the bridge, the injuries, and the subsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act. Also, include his later achievements and the moral message he delivered.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful events and terms. Make sure to include words like "struggle," "voting," "fractured," "illegal," "violence," "brutality," "clubbed," "teargassed," "march," " Bloody Sunday," "redeem," etc.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow from the event in Selma, the violence, the outcome, and Lewis's lasting impact. I'll make sure each sentence incorporates the moral framing words without making it sound forced.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral terms are included naturally.

SUMMARY: John Lewis, a civil rights icon, faced state-sanctioned violence during the 1965 voting rights march in Selma, Alabama. Leading hundreds of demonstrators, Lewis and Hosea Williams approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where Alabama state troopers, acting on Gov. George C. Wallace’s orders, unleashed brutal force. Troopers attacked the peaceful marchers with nightsticks and tear gas, fracturing Lewis’s skull and injuring others, including Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was beaten unconscious. This confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and highlighted the struggle against racial discrimination. The event led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, who survived the attack, remained a vocal advocate for justice, urging others to "get in good trouble" to redeem America’s soul. His legacy endures as a symbol of the civil rights movement’s fight for equality. END OF SUMMARY.
