SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. Lewis is known for his role in the infamous Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, where he led a group of peaceful voting rights marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They were met by a wall of Alabama state troopers and members of the sheriff's posse, who brutally beat them with nightsticks and tear gas. Lewis, despite being knocked to the ground and sustaining a fractured skull, never lost consciousness and continued to fight for racial equality. The confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis' bravery and moral courage in the face of state-sanctioned brutality and racist segregationist policies in Alabama are a testament to his strength and dedication to justice. Even in his later years, after being diagnosed with cancer, Lewis continued to speak out against racial injustice, encouraging others to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble." His legacy inspires ongoing efforts to redeem the soul of America.
