SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis was a key figure in the 1960s civil rights movement, leading voting rights demonstrations in Selma, Alabama. On March 7, 1965, Lewis, then 25, led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met with violence from Alabama state troopers. Lewis was beaten, sustaining a fractured skull, but the event helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis went on to become a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, serving in Congress and advocating for racial equality. He continued to speak out against racial discrimination, even in his later years, encouraging others to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America."
