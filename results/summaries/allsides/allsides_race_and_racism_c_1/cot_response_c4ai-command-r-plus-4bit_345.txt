SUMMARY:
The civil rights hero and activist John Lewis passed away at the age of 80. Lewis is remembered for his courageous stand against racial discrimination and his pivotal role in the U.S. civil rights movement. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a violent and racist response from Alabama state troopers and the segregationist governor, George C. Wallace, Lewis and the other marchers stood their ground. The troopers, armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, brutally attacked the peaceful protesters, leaving many injured and unconscious. Lewis himself sustained a fractured skull from the beatings. This event, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis' unwavering commitment to justice and equality was evident in his final words, urging others to "speak up, speak out, get in the way." His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of moral courage in the face of injustice.
