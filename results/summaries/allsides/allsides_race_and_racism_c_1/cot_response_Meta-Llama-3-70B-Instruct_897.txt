SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. The troopers, armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, were ordered by segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace to disperse the peaceful marchers. The ensuing violence shocked the nation, leading to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courageous stand propelled him onto the global stage, where he advocated for freedom and human rights. In his later years, Lewis continued to speak out against racism and segregation, urging people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." END OF SUMMARY.
