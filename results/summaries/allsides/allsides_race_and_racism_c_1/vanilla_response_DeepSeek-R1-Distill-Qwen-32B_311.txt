Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article about John Lewis. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about John Lewis's role in the civil rights movement, specifically the march in Selma in 1965. It describes the violent confrontation with state troopers, known as Bloody Sunday, which led to the Voting Rights Act. Lewis's leadership and his later life, including his death in 2020, are also covered.

I should focus on the key events: the march, the violence, the impact on legislation, and Lewis's legacy. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include important details like his age at the time, the outcome of the march, and his later achievements.

I'll start by mentioning his death, then go back to the 1965 event, the consequences, and his long-term impact. I should make sure to highlight his courage and the significance of the Voting Rights Act. Also, noting that he outlived many of his contemporaries adds context to his lasting influence.

I need to structure this clearly, ensuring each sentence flows logically to the next, covering all essential points without unnecessary details. Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY: John Lewis, a civil rights icon who survived the violent 1965 Bloody Sunday attack in Selma, Alabama, passed away at 80. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where Alabama state troopers, acting under Governor George C. Wallace's orders, brutally attacked them. Lewis was beaten and suffered a fractured skull, but the confrontation galvanized national support for voting rights, leading to the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year. Lewis, alongside Hosea Williams, continued the march to Montgomery, ultimately achieving their goal. Known for his activism and later career in Congress, Lewis remained a symbol of nonviolent resistance. His legacy endured long after key figures like Wallace, Williams, and others passed away. Lewis's final address on the Selma bridge in 2020, after his cancer diagnosis, reiterated his call for peaceful activism. END OF SUMMARY.
