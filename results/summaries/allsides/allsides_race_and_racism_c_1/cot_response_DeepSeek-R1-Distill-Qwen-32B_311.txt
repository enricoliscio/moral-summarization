Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Let me read through it again.

The article starts by describing the events of March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama. It mentions "state troopers," "billy club," "fractured skull," "racial discrimination," "voting rights," "freedom," "segregationist," "bravery," "hero," "Voting Rights Act," "peaceful," "brutality," "courage," "equality," "nonviolent," "injustice," "good trouble," "necessary trouble," "redeem," "soul of America," and "legacy." These words all carry strong moral implications related to justice, rights, and the struggle against oppression.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral words intact. I'll start by mentioning John Lewis's death and his role in the civil rights movement. Then, I'll highlight the key event on Bloody Sunday, the confrontation with the troopers, and the impact it had on the Voting Rights Act. I should also include his later life, his legacy, and the moral messages he promoted, like "good trouble" and redeeming America's soul. I'll make sure to keep the summary under 200 words and include as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it too lengthy.

This confrontation, marked by state-sanctioned brutality, galvanized national support and led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courage and commitment to justice inspired generations, emphasizing the importance of "good trouble" and "necessary trouble" to redeem America's soul. His legacy continues to symbolize the fight against racial discrimination and the pursuit of equality. END OF SUMMARY.
