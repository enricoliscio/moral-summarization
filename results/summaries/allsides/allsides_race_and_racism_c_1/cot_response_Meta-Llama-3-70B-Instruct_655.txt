SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at age 80. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. The confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis stood motionless, with his hands in his pockets, as the troopers advanced, and he was knocked to the ground and hit in the head with a nightstick. The violence was sanctioned by segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace, who had vowed "segregation forever" during his inaugural. Lewis's message of freedom and equality continued to inspire, and he urged people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." END OF SUMMARY.
