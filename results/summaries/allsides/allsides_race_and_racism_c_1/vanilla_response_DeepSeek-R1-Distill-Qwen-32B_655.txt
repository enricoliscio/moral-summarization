Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts with a photo from 1965 showing John Lewis being attacked by a state trooper during a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama. He was leading a march towards the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 

The article mentions that Lewis was 25 at the time and had been leading voting rights demonstrations. The troopers, under orders from Governor Wallace, attacked the marchers, leading to what's known as Bloody Sunday. This event helped pass the Voting Rights Act. 

Lewis was beaten and suffered a fractured skull but didn't lose consciousness. Others, like Amelia Boynton Robinson, were also severely injured. The article also notes that Lewis survived and went on to become a prominent figure in Congress, addressing the nation on the 55th anniversary of the march despite a cancer diagnosis. 

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include key points: the event on Bloody Sunday, Lewis's role, the outcome leading to the Voting Rights Act, his injuries, and his later life and legacy. I should avoid unnecessary details and keep it concise.

I'll start by mentioning the event, the attack, its significance, Lewis's survival, and the impact on the Voting Rights Act. Then, I'll note his later life and passing. I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all essential aspects without getting bogged down in specifics.
