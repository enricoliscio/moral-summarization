Alright, I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis, preserving the moral framing as much as possible. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the 1965 voting rights march in Selma where John Lewis was attacked by state troopers. This event led to the Voting Rights Act. The author uses words like "swings," "fractured," "violence," and "brutality" to convey the moral struggle.

I should start by identifying the key events: the march, the confrontation, the injuries, and the aftermath. I need to include the morally framed words like "struggle," "racial," "illegal," "violence," "brutality," and "redeem."

I'll structure the summary to highlight Lewis's leadership, the state's violent response, and the eventual success of the movement. I'll make sure to mention the Voting Rights Act and the moral message Lewis conveyed later.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful events and the moral language. I'll also mention the commemoration and his final message to tie it all together.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
John Lewis, a civil rights icon, faced state-sanctioned violence during the 1965 voting rights march in Selma, Alabama. Leading hundreds of marchers, Lewis confronted Alabama state troopers, who attacked with brutal force, fracturing his skull and injuring others. The confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and helped secure the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis, along with Hosea Williams, stood firm as troopers unleashed a spasm of violence, beating and tear-gassing marchers while whites cheered nearby. Despite the chaos, Lewis survived and later testified about the brutality, emphasizing the struggle against racial discrimination. His leadership and message of nonviolent resistance inspired a global movement. Decades later, Lewis returned to Selma to commemorate the event, urging others to "get in good trouble" and redeem America's soul. His legacy remains a testament to the power of peaceful protest in the face of segregation and injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
