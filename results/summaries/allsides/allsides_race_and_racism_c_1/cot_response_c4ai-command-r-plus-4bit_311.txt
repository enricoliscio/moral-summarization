SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, died at the age of 80. He is remembered for his courageous stand against racial discrimination in the 1960s, particularly in Selma, Alabama. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to protest voting rights discrimination. They were met by a violent response from Alabama state troopers, an event known as Bloody Sunday. Despite the troopers' brutality, Lewis stood his ground, and his actions helped lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis's commitment to nonviolent resistance and justice was unwavering, even in the face of violent repression. In his final years, he continued to inspire others to "get in good trouble" and fight for what is right. This news article recalls the moral courage and strength of John Lewis, who faced racist violence with dignity and determination, becoming a hero of the civil rights movement.
