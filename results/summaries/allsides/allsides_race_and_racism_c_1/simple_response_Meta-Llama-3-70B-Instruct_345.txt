SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80 on July 17, 2020. In 1965, at 25, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to fight for racial equality, leading to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. The confrontation on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and propelled Lewis to a global stage. Lewis's courage and perseverance inspired others to stand up against racial discrimination, and his legacy continues to urge people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." Lewis's moral courage and commitment to nonviolent resistance serve as a beacon of hope for a more just and equitable society.
