SUMMARY: John Lewis, a civil rights icon who carried the struggle against racial discrimination from the battlefields of the 1960s to the US Congress, passed away in July 2020. Lewis played a pivotal role in the voting rights movement, and his actions on March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama, are remembered as a seminal moment in the civil rights movement. Leading a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Lewis and his fellow activists were confronted by Alabama state troopers and met with a violent response. Despite being severely beaten and sustaining a fractured skull, Lewis stood firm and continued to fight for equality. The confrontation helped lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis' bravery and dedication to justice were recognized globally, and he continued to inspire others to "get in good trouble" until his death at the age of 80. Other key figures from that day, including Governor George Wallace and Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., have also passed away, leaving Lewis as one of the last surviving leaders of that historic march.
