SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to fight for racial equality, leading to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. His courageous act on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, propelled him to a global stage as a champion of human rights. Lewis's unwavering commitment to justice and equality inspired generations to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." Throughout his life, Lewis remained steadfast in his pursuit of a more just society, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and motivate others to stand up against racial discrimination and fight for human rights.
