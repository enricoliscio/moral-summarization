SUMMARY: John Lewis, a civil rights leader and congressman, passed away on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis was a key figure in the U.S. civil rights movement, particularly in the struggle for voting rights. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in an attempt to bring a message of freedom to segregationist Governor George C. Wallace. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and a violent confrontation, Lewis and the other marchers stood their ground, and their actions helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's bravery and commitment to nonviolent protest inspired many and earned him a place in history as a hero of the civil rights movement. He continued to fight for equality and social justice throughout his life, even as he battled cancer in his later years. His death was mourned by many, and his legacy is remembered as an inspiring example of courage and dedication to positive social change. END OF SUMMARY.
