Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral elements.

The article is about John Lewis's role in the 1965 voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, which became known as Bloody Sunday. It describes the violent confrontation with state troopers, the injuries sustained, and the eventual impact on the Voting Rights Act. The author uses strong moral language to convey the struggle against racial discrimination and the bravery of the marchers.

I need to extract the main events and ensure that the moral terms are included. The key points are:
- Lewis leading the march towards the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
- The state troopers' brutal response, including the use of clubs and tear gas.
- Lewis being injured, specifically a fractured skull.
- The marchers' peaceful stance and the violent reaction from authorities.
- The subsequent legal actions and the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
- Lewis's legacy and his message about speaking up and getting into "good trouble."

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral struggle, the violence used against peaceful demonstrators, and the eventual triumph in the form of the Voting Rights Act. I need to make sure to include words like "voting," "fractured," "violence," "brutality," "march," "movement," "illegal," "spasm," "clubbed," "teargassed," "overturned," "redeem," etc.

I should start by setting the scene of the march, describe the confrontation, the injuries, and the aftermath, making sure to emphasize the moral implications of each event. I also need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while including as many of the specified terms as possible.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes relevant moral terms without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
John Lewis, a civil rights icon, led a peaceful voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965, when Alabama state troopers, acting on Gov. George C. Wallace’s orders, unleashed brutal violence. Lewis, 25 at the time, stood firm as troopers attacked with nightsticks and tear gas, fracturing his skull. The confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and highlighted the struggle against racial discrimination. Despite the illegal and violent suppression, Lewis and fellow activists Hosea Williams persisted, advocating for freedom and justice. The marchers were beaten, tear-gassed, and clubbed, with some, like Amelia Boynton Robinson, sustaining severe injuries. The violence, captured in archival footage, exposed the spasm of state-sanctioned brutality. Lewis’s resilience and commitment to the movement inspired a global call for change. The incident led to the overturning of Wallace’s order and the eventual passage of the Voting Rights Act. Decades later, Lewis remained a beacon of hope, urging others to “get in good trouble” and redeem America’s soul. His legacy endures as a testament to the power of peaceful protest and unwavering struggle against segregation and injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
