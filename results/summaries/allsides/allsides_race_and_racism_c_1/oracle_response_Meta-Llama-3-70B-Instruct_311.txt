SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80, leaving behind a legacy of fighting against racial discrimination. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to carry the struggle for racial equality, inspiring a global movement. The ensuing confrontation led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's message of freedom and equality was met with brutality, as troopers unleashed a spasm of violence, jabbing and clubbing peaceful marchers. The bloody incident shocked the nation, but Lewis's courage and determination helped redeem the soul of America. Throughout his life, Lewis continued to march, walk, and speak out against segregation, urging others to get in "good trouble, necessary trouble" to bring about change. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations to carry the struggle for racial equality forward. END OF SUMMARY.
