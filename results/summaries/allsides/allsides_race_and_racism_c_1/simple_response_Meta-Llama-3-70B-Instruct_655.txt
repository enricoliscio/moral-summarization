SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, died at 80, leaving behind a legacy of fighting against racial discrimination. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to fight for freedom and equality, eventually becoming a hero of the US civil rights movement. The confrontation on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courage and perseverance inspired others to stand up against injustice, and he remained a vocal advocate for human rights until his passing. His final message, "Speak up, speak out, get in the way... Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America," continues to inspire generations to come.
