Okay, I need to summarize this article about John Lewis. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with a photo from March 7, 1965, showing John Lewis being attacked by a state trooper during a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama. It mentions that Lewis died at 80 on July 17, 2020. 

Then it goes into the details of the march on that day. Lewis was 25, leading hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They were met by state troopers, who were ordered by Governor George Wallace to stop them. The confrontation was brutal, leading to what's known as Bloody Sunday. Lewis was beaten, suffered a fractured skull, and others were injured too. This event helped pass the Voting Rights Act.

The article also talks about how Lewis continued his activism, marching again later, and how he outlived many of the people involved in that day, including Wallace and other leaders. He remained an activist until his death, encouraging people to get involved in necessary trouble for justice.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: who John Lewis was, the 1965 march, the violence, the impact on the Voting Rights Act, his later life, and his message.

I should make sure to mention his death, the significance of the march, and his lasting impact on the civil rights movement. Also, include the outcome of the march and how it led to the law change.

Let me structure this: start with his death, then the 1965 event, the violence, the consequences, and his legacy.

I should avoid too many details, just the essentials. Maybe mention the Voting Rights Act specifically, his role in it, and his encouragement to others.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's concise and covers all these points without going over the word limit.
