SUMMARY: John Lewis, a prominent civil rights activist and congressman, died at the age of 80. Lewis was a key figure in the civil rights movement, particularly in the struggle for voting rights. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in an attempt to bring a message of freedom to segregationist Governor George C. Wallace. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and a violent confrontation, Lewis and the other marchers stood their ground, and their actions helped lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis's bravery and commitment to nonviolent resistance made him a hero of the civil rights movement and an inspiration for generations to come. On that day, Lewis and other civil rights activists were brutally beaten by state troopers and members of the sheriff's posse, but their determination to fight for their rights never wavered. Lewis's testimony about the incident was instrumental in overturning Wallace's order and allowing demonstrators to march to Montgomery. Lewis's legacy is an enduring reminder of the power of peaceful protest and the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.
