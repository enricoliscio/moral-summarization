SUMMARY: Civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis was a prominent figure in the U.S. civil rights movement, particularly in the struggle for voting rights. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in an attempt to take a message of freedom to segregationist Governor George C. Wallace. However, the marchers were met by a line of Alabama state troopers who stopped them and unleashed a wave of violence, an event known as Bloody Sunday. Despite being beaten and tear-gassed, Lewis and the other marchers persevered, and their actions helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis' courage and dedication to the cause of racial equality inspired many and earned him a place in history as a hero of the civil rights movement. Lewis' legacy was honored during the 55th commemoration of Bloody Sunday, where he encouraged others to "speak up, speak out, get in the way."
END OF SUMMARY.
