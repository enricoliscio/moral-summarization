SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and the threat of violence, Lewis courageously continued to march, taking a stand against racial discrimination. The confrontation on the bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, resulted in a brutal display of state-sanctioned violence, with troopers beating and teargassing marchers. Lewis himself sustained a fractured skull after being hit by a nightstick. The march, however, was not in vain. The ensuing outrage helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act, a critical step forward in the struggle for racial equality. Lewis' unwavering commitment to justice and his willingness to face adversity head-on serve as a testament to his moral character. His actions in Selma and throughout his life helped redeem the soul of America by dismantling segregation and protecting the right to vote. 

END OF SUMMARY.
