SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. Lewis carried the struggle against racial discrimination from the Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and a crowd of whites, Lewis put one foot forward, propelling him onto the global stage. The confrontation that ensued, later known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.

Lewis and fellow marchers were given two minutes to disperse by Maj. John Cloud of the Alabama Department of Safety, who then unleashed a spasm of state-sanctioned violence and brutality. Lewis was knocked to the ground, hit in the head with a nightstick, and beaten as whites cheered from nearby. Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was behind Lewis, was tear-gassed and beaten unconscious. Despite his injuries, Lewis continued to fight for justice, addressing a throng atop the bridge years later, urging them to "speak up, speak out, get in the way." Lewis' unwavering commitment to racial equality and his courageous actions in Selma helped redeem the soul of America.
END OF SUMMARY.
