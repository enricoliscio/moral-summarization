SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, passed away on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis is remembered for his courageous leadership in the face of racial discrimination and his commitment to fighting for voting rights for all. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and the threat of violence, Lewis courageously continued the march, taking a stand against segregation and injustice. The confrontation led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act and helped to propel Lewis onto the global stage as a champion of equality. Lewis' unwavering dedication to justice and his willingness to face adversity head-on serve as a testament to his moral character and strength of conviction. His legacy inspires us to continue the fight for equal rights and to speak up against racism and discrimination in all its forms. Even facing violent repression from the state troopers, Lewis remained nonviolent and kept fighting for what was right. END OF SUMMARY.
