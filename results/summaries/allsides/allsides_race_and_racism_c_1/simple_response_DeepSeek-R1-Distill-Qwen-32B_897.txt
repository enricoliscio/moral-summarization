Alright, I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about the 1965 Selma march, the violence faced by Lewis and others, and the impact on the Voting Rights Act. The moral aspect is about the struggle for justice and equality.

I should highlight Lewis's courage, the brutality of the troopers, and the eventual success leading to the Voting Rights Act. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and their significance. Also, include that Lewis survived and continued his activism, emphasizing his role as a hero. I'll structure it to show the moral struggle and the triumph, maintaining the tone from the original text.
