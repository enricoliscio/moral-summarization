SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965, despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers armed with gas canisters and nightsticks. Lewis, then 25, was determined to deliver a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace in Montgomery. However, the troopers, acting on Wallace's order, unleashed a spasm of state-sanctioned violence, brutally attacking the peaceful marchers. Lewis was hit on the head with a nightstick, fracturing his skull, and others were beaten, tear-gassed, and clubbed. The incident, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courage and determination in the face of racial discrimination and violence propelled him to a global stage, where he continued to advocate for freedom and human rights. Throughout his life, Lewis urged people to "speak up, speak out, get in the way" and "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." END OF SUMMARY.
