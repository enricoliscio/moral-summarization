SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80. In 1965, Lewis led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. The ensuing confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis stood motionless, with his hands in his pockets, as troopers approached, and was knocked to the ground, hit in the head with a nightstick. Others were beaten even worse, with whites cheering from nearby. Lewis's bravery and determination propelled him to a global stage, where he advocated for freedom and justice. In his final years, Lewis continued to speak out against racial discrimination, urging people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." END OF SUMMARY.
