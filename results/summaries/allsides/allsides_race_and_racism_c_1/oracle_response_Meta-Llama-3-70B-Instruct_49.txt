SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights hero, died at 80, leaving behind a legacy of struggle against racial discrimination. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers, sustaining a fractured skull. The violent confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, with fellow activist Hosea Williams, stood firm against the phalanx of troopers, despite being told to disperse. The ensuing spasm of state-sanctioned violence was brutal, with troopers jabbing, tangling, hitting, and tear-gassing peaceful marchers. Lewis was knocked to the ground, beaten, and left with injuries. Despite this, he continued to carry the message of freedom, leading a 52-mile march to Montgomery. Lewis's courageous stand inspired a movement, and his legacy urges us to "speak up, speak out, get in the way" to redeem the soul of America.
