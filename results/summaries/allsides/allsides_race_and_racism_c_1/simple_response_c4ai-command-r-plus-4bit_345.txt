SUMMARY: John Lewis, a courageous and noble civil rights activist, passed away at the age of 80. He is remembered for his fearless leadership in the face of racial discrimination and his unwavering commitment to justice. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of peaceful marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in defiance of segregationist Governor George C. Wallace. Despite the threat of violence, Lewis courageously took a step forward, propelling him onto the global stage as a hero of the civil rights movement.

The marchers were confronted by a brutal display of state-sanctioned violence, with Alabama state troopers beating and tear-gassing the peaceful demonstrators. Lewis himself was struck in the head with a nightstick, but he remained resolute and testified in court about the injustice he had witnessed. The confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act, a testament to Lewis' unwavering determination to fight for equality.

Lewis' legacy is one of courage, morality, and unwavering dedication to the cause of racial equality. His words continue to inspire: "Speak up, speak out, get in the way [...] Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." John Lewis' life and work serve as a reminder of the power of moral courage in the face of injustice.
