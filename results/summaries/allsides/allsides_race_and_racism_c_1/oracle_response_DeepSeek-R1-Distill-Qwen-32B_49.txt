Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about John Lewis while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about John Lewis's role in the 1965 voting rights march in Selma, the violence faced, and the impact on the Voting Rights Act. The morally framed words include words like "struggle," "racial," "violence," "brutality," etc.

I should start by identifying the main events: the march, the confrontation with troopers, Lewis's injuries, and the aftermath leading to the Voting Rights Act. I need to include the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Lewis's leadership, the violent response, and the positive outcome. I'll make sure to use words like "struggle," "voting," "fractured," "violence," "brutality," and "redeem."

I should also mention the federal Voting Rights Act and the legacy of the march. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the essential moral elements.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I incorporate the key morally framed words and maintain the flow of events from the article.

SUMMARY:  
John Lewis, a civil rights icon, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965, when state troopers attacked peaceful demonstrators in a brutal confrontation. Lewis, then 25, faced racial discrimination and state-sanctioned violence as troopers swung nightsticks, tear-gassed, and clubbed marchers. Lewis was beaten and suffered a fractured skull, but his struggle for freedom and justice persisted. The violence, captured in archival footage, shocked the nation and helped overturn segregationist policies, leading to the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis’s message of nonviolent resistance inspired global change. Despite the brutal attack, he remained committed to redeeming America’s soul, urging others to "get in good trouble" and fight for equality. His legacy endures as a symbol of the civil rights movement’s unyielding spirit. END OF SUMMARY.
