SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965, despite knowing it would be met with violence. As he approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he was confronted by Alabama state troopers armed with gas canisters and nightsticks. Lewis, then 25, was determined to deliver a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace. When ordered to disperse, Lewis stood firm, and the troopers unleashed a brutal attack, fracturing his skull and injuring many others. The violent confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's courage and perseverance in the face of racial discrimination and brutality propelled him to become a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. Throughout his life, Lewis continued to advocate for justice, urging people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America."
