SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and the threat of violence, Lewis courageously continued the march, taking a stand against racial discrimination. The confrontation on the bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, resulted in Lewis being knocked to the ground and beaten, sustaining a fractured skull. The brutal event shocked the nation and helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis' unwavering commitment to carrying the message of freedom forward and his willingness to face adversity in the struggle for equality are a testament to his moral character. He later addressed a crowd on the same bridge, urging them to "speak up, speak out, get in the way." Lewis' legacy serves as a reminder of the power of nonviolent direct action in the face of injustice and the enduring fight against racial segregation. END OF SUMMARY.
