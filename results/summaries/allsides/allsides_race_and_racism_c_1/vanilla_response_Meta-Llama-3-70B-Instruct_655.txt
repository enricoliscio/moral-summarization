SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights leader, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis was a key figure in the 1960s civil rights movement, leading voting rights demonstrations in Selma, Alabama. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met by Alabama state troopers armed with gas canisters and nightsticks. The ensuing confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, was marked by state-sanctioned violence and helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis was beaten and suffered a fractured skull, but continued to fight for racial equality, eventually becoming a congressman. He outlived other key players in the movement, including Gov. George C. Wallace, Maj. John Cloud, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Lewis continued to advocate for civil rights until his death, leaving behind a legacy as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement.
