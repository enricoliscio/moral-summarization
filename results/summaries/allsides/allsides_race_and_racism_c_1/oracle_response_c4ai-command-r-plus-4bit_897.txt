SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at the age of 80. Lewis carried the struggle against racial discrimination from the Southern battlegrounds of the 1960s to the halls of Congress. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a demonstration for voting rights. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and the threat of violence, Lewis and the marchers continued to advance forward, carrying a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace. The troopers, acting on Wallace's order, declared the march illegal and unleashed a spasm of brutality, beating and teargassing the marchers. Lewis was knocked to the ground and hit in the head with a nightstick, fracturing his skull. Despite the injuries and violence, the confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis' unwavering commitment to the struggle for racial equality and his willingness to face adversity and march towards necessary trouble to redeem the soul of America, left a lasting legacy.
