SUMMARY: John Lewis, a prominent civil rights activist and US congressman, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis was a key figure in the American civil rights movement, particularly in the struggle for voting rights. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in an attempt to bring attention to the issue of racial discrimination and demand the right to vote for African Americans. Despite facing violent resistance from Alabama state troopers and local law enforcement, Lewis and the other marchers persisted, and their actions ultimately contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year. Lewis' bravery and commitment to nonviolent protest left a lasting impact on the civil rights movement and inspired future generations to continue the fight for equality. Lewis' legacy is remembered as a courageous leader who dedicated his life to fighting for racial equality and social justice.
