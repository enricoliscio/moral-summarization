SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. The event, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, who suffered a fractured skull, continued to fight for racial equality, becoming a hero of the US civil rights movement. He went on to serve in Congress, carrying the struggle against racial discrimination from the Southern battlegrounds to the halls of power. Lewis's legacy includes his famous phrase "Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." He outlived other key players in the movement, including Gov. George C. Wallace, Maj. John Cloud, and fellow activists Hosea Williams and Amelia Boynton Robinson.
