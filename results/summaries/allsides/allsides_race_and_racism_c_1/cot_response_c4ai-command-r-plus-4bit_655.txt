SUMMARY:
On March 7, 1965, John Lewis, a 25-year-old civil rights activist, led a group of marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in a stand against segregationist Governor George Wallace. Despite facing a line of Alabama state troopers and their violent, state-sanctioned brutality, Lewis and his fellow marchers stood their ground, and their actions helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, who died in 2020 at the age of 80, became a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement for his unwavering commitment to freedom and justice. In the face of brutal racism and segregation, Lewis chose to speak up and take necessary action to redeem the soul of America. On what became known as Bloody Sunday, Lewis and his fellow marchers were beaten and tear-gassed, with Lewis himself sustaining a fractured skull. Despite the brutality, Lewis and the other marchers persevered and eventually completed a 52-mile walk to Montgomery. In his later years, Lewis addressed a throng atop the bridge, urging them to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble." Wallace, who refused to meet with the marchers, died in 1998, refusing to meet with the marchers and upholding his vow of "segregation forever." END OF SUMMARY.
