Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article describes the 1965 march in Selma where John Lewis was beaten by state troopers, leading to the Voting Rights Act. It's a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. The author uses words like "swing," "voting," "fractured," etc., to convey the moral struggle.

I should start by identifying the main events: the march, the confrontation, the violence, and the aftermath. I need to include as many of the listed words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the morally framed terms.

I'll structure it by mentioning Lewis leading the march, the state troopers' violence, the impact on the movement, and the legacy. I'll make sure to use words like "struggle," "racial," "violence," "brutality," "march," and "redeem" to maintain the moral tone.

Let me draft a summary that flows well, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Okay, I think that covers the main points and includes the necessary moral terms. Let me make sure it's under 200 words and that all important aspects of the article are included.

SUMMARY:  
John Lewis, a civil rights icon, faced brutal state-sanctioned violence during the 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, where he was beaten by troopers on Bloody Sunday. His struggle against racial discrimination and fight for voting rights became a defining moment in the civil rights movement. The confrontation led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark achievement. Lewis, alongside Hosea Williams, stood firm against troopers ordered to disperse the peaceful demonstration. The ensuing spasm of violence—troopers jabbing nightsticks, tangled bodies, and screams—shocked the nation. Lewis was knocked to the ground, fractured his skull, and beaten, while others, including Amelia Boynton Robinson, were tear-gassed and clubbed. The brutality was cheered by onlookers, but the marchers' resilience overturned segregationist policies. Lewis later led the successful 52-mile march to Montgomery, symbolizing the movement's unwavering commitment to justice. His legacy, rooted in "good trouble" to redeem America's soul, endures as a testament to the power of nonviolent resistance. END OF SUMMARY.
