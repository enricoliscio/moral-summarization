SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, died at 80, leaving behind a legacy of fighting against racial discrimination. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. The troopers, armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, were ordered by Governor George Wallace to stop the march, which was deemed illegal. Lewis, with fellow activist Hosea Williams, stood firm, but was met with a spasm of state-sanctioned violence, including being jabbed with a nightstick and knocked to the ground. The brutal attack shocked the nation and led to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis's struggle against racial discrimination continued, and he became a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. He carried the message of freedom and redemption, urging people to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." Lewis's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up against racial segregation and violence.
