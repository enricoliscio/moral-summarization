SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights hero, died at 80, leaving behind a legacy of fighting against racial discrimination. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. Despite the violence, Lewis continued to advocate for freedom and equality, playing a key role in the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. The confrontation on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known as Bloody Sunday, shocked the nation and propelled Lewis to the global stage as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. Lewis's courage and conviction inspired others to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." His moral leadership and unwavering commitment to justice continue to inspire generations to stand up against injustice and fight for human rights.
