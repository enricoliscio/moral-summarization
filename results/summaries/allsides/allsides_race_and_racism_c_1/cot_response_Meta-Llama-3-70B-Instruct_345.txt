SUMMARY:
John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, died at 80. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. The ensuing confrontation, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis stood motionless, with his hands in his pockets, as the troopers approached, and was hit in the head with a nightstick. Others were beaten worse, and whites cheered from nearby. Lewis's courage and conviction inspired a nation, and he continued to fight for freedom and equality throughout his life. He urged others to "get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America." END OF SUMMARY.
