SUMMARY:

John Lewis, a civil rights icon, died on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. In 1965, Lewis, then 25, led a voting rights march in Selma, Alabama, where he was brutally beaten by state troopers. The event, known as Bloody Sunday, helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act. Lewis, alongside fellow activist Hosea Williams, approached a line of troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met with violence. Lewis was hit in the head with a nightstick, fracturing his skull. Despite the brutality, Lewis continued to fight for racial equality, becoming a hero of the US civil rights movement. He went on to serve in Congress, advocating for social justice and human rights. Lewis's legacy continues to inspire, with his famous phrase "Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America."
