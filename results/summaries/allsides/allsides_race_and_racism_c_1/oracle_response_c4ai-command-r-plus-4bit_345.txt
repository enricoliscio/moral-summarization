SUMMARY: On March 7, 1965, John Lewis, a 25-year-old civil rights activist, led a voting rights demonstration in Selma, Alabama, known as Bloody Sunday. Despite facing violent resistance from Alabama state troopers and a segregationist governor, Lewis courageously continued the march, taking a stand against racial discrimination. The troopers, armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, brutally attacked the peaceful protesters, leaving Lewis with a fractured skull and others with serious injuries.

The confrontation, witnessed by a global audience, was a seminal moment in the U.S. civil rights movement. It highlighted the struggle against racial segregation and the fight for voting rights. Lewis's determination to continue marching, even in the face of danger, sent a powerful message of freedom and justice.

Lewis's actions that day, and throughout his life, embodied the spirit of moral courage and commitment to nonviolent resistance. He continued to speak up and take action against racial injustice, even until his death in 2020. His legacy inspires ongoing efforts to redeem the soul of America and ensure equal rights for all.
