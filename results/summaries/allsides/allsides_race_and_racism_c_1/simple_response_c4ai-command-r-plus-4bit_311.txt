SUMMARY: John Lewis, a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement, passed away on July 17, 2020, at the age of 80. Lewis is remembered for his courageous stand against racial discrimination, particularly in the infamous Selma march of 1965, where he and other activists were brutally beaten by Alabama state troopers. Despite the violence inflicted upon them, Lewis and his fellow marchers persisted, and their actions helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.

Lewis' bravery and commitment to justice extended beyond the civil rights era. He continued to fight for equality and social justice throughout his life, eventually earning a seat in the U.S. Congress, where he represented the values he had fought for on the front lines of the civil rights movement. Even in his later years, Lewis remained dedicated to the cause, encouraging others to "speak up, speak out, get in the way." His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of peaceful protest and the enduring struggle for equality in America.
