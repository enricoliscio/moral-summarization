Alright, I need to summarize this news article about John Lewis while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about John Lewis's role in the civil rights movement, specifically the 1965 march in Selma. He was beaten by state troopers, which led to the Voting Rights Act. It also mentions his later life and death. 

I should highlight his courage and the impact of the event. The moral aspect is about standing up against injustice, so I'll emphasize that. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and his legacy.

I'll start by mentioning his death and then go back to the march, the violence, and the outcome. I'll also include his famous quote about getting into "good trouble." Ending with his legacy and the Voting Rights Act ties it all together morally.

Let me structure it: introduce his passing, describe the 1965 march, the violence faced, the outcome, and his enduring message. Keep it concise and impactful, making sure the moral message is clear.

SUMMARY:  
John Lewis, a civil rights icon, passed away at 80, leaving a legacy of unwavering courage in the fight against racial injustice. On March 7, 1965, Lewis led hundreds of marchers in Selma, Alabama, to demand voting rights, confronting a phalanx of state troopers under Governor George C. Wallace’s orders. The troopers unleashed brutal violence, leaving Lewis with a fractured skull and others gravely injured in what became known as "Bloody Sunday." This confrontation galvanized national support, leading to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lewis, alongside Hosea Williams, later led a successful march to Montgomery, symbolizing resilience and the power of nonviolent protest. His moral stance on standing up against injustice, encapsulated in his phrase "get in good trouble," inspired generations. Lewis’s life was a testament to the enduring fight for equality and justice.
