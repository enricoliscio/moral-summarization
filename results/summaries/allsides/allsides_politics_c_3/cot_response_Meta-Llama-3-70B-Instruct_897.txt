SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump sparked outrage with his racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries, despite three of them being born in the United States. House Democrats condemned Trump's remarks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's comments reflect his plan to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted strongly, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting, "THIS is what racism looks like." International criticism followed, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language "completely unacceptable." Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd, also spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming many people agree with him. END OF SUMMARY.
