Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump's recent comments about some Democratic congresswomen. He told them to "go back" to their countries, which they mostly were born in the U.S., except one who came as a refugee. The congresswomen are part of "The Squad," which includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. They are from diverse backgroundsâ€”Muslim, Hispanic, and black.

House Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are calling for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks as racist and xenophobic. Pelosi criticized Trump's comments, saying they reflect a desire to make America white again. Trump, on the other hand, denied his comments were racist, saying people who don't like the country can leave. He also accused the congresswomen of hating the U.S. and Israel.

The congresswomen themselves reacted strongly, calling out Trump's racism. Some Republicans also criticized Trump, with Rep. Will Hurd calling the tweets racist and unbecoming of a world leader. International figures, like British PM Theresa May, also condemned the language used.

The summary needs to capture the main points: Trump's comments, the reaction from Democrats, Pelosi's response, the congresswomen's backgrounds, their reactions, some Republican criticism, and international condemnation. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and includes all key elements without getting too detailed.
