SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, but House Democrats and international leaders condemned his xenophobic tweets as "completely unacceptable" and "racist." The President claimed the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel, and that they should apologize to the country and the Office of the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's remarks "xenophobic" and said they reflect his plan to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted strongly, with one member tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, also spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "disgusting." END OF SUMMARY.
