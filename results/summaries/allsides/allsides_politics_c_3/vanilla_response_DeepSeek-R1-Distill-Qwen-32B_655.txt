Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Trump's recent comments towards some Democratic congresswomen. He told them to "go back" to their countries, but most were born in the U.S. The congresswomen are part of "The Squad," which includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. Three of them were born in the U.S., and Omar came as a refugee.

Trump denied his comments were racist, saying if they don't like the country, they can leave. He also criticized their language towards the U.S. and Israel. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks as xenophobic. Pelosi mentioned that Trump's plan is about making America white again, highlighting the country's diversity as a strength.

The congresswomen reacted by pointing out racism. Some Republicans, like Will Hurd and Pat Toomey, also criticized Trump's tweets as racist and xenophobic. Trump linked the Squad to the Democrats in general, focusing on their views on the Middle East.

So, the summary should include Trump's comments, the reaction from Democrats, the congresswomen's responses, some Republican criticism, and the context of Trump's re-election campaign.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all the key points without going into too much detail. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it step by step: Trump's comments, denial of racism, Pelosi's response, the congresswomen's reactions, Republican criticism, and the political implications.

I think that covers all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise manner.
