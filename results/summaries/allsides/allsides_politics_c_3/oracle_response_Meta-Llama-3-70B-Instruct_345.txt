SUMMARY: President Donald Trump sparked outrage with racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries, despite most being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on lawmakers to pass a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, saying "the House cannot allow the President's characterization of immigrants to stand." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted with outrage, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." Even some Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist, and xenophobic." The incident highlights Trump's divisive tactics and hate-filled rhetoric, which has united Democrats in condemnation. END OF SUMMARY.
