Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments and the reactions. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article starts with House Democrats calling for a resolution against Trump for racism. Trump responded by saying the congresswomen should apologize, denying his comments were racist. He told them to leave if they don't like the country, even though most were born here.

He tweeted about the Squad, the four minority women, telling them to go back and fix their countries. Three were born in the U.S., and Ilhan Omar is a refugee. Pelosi condemned his xenophobic tweets, saying it's about making America white again. The Squad reacted, with Pressley calling it racism and Tlaib fighting corruption in the U.S.

Internationally, May's spokesperson criticized Trump. Some Republicans also spoke out, like Hurd and Toomey, saying the tweets were racist and unbecoming. Amash, a former Republican, called it disgusting.

So, the summary needs to cover Trump's tweets, his denial, Pelosi's response, the Squad's reactions, international and Republican criticism, and the context of Trump's re-election. Keep it under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Focus on Trump's actions, the main reactions, and the political implications.
