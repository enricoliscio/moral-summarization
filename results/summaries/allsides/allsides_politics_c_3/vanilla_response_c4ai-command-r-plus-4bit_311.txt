SUMMARY: President Donald Trump doubled down on his racist tweets towards four minority Democratic congresswomen, saying they should apologize to him and the country. Three of the four congresswomen were born in the United States, and Trump's comments were widely condemned by Democrats and some Republicans, as well as internationally. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's xenophobic remarks, while the targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage and called out Trump's racism. Trump's tweets also linked the views of "the Squad" to the Democratic Party as a whole, and he claimed that their criticism of Israel made the country feel abandoned by the US. The president's comments united Democrats in their condemnation and drew criticism from abroad, including British Prime Minister Theresa May. Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, also spoke out against Trump's racist and xenophobic language.
END OF SUMMARY.
