SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, but House Democrats condemned his xenophobic tweets, saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The president's remarks were widely criticized, with many calling them racist and xenophobic. Even some Republicans spoke out against Trump's attacks, with Rep. Will Hurd saying the tweets were "racist, and xenophobic" and Sen. Pat Toomey calling them "wrong." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded by saying Trump's comments were a clear example of racism. The international community also weighed in, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language "completely unacceptable." END OF SUMMARY.
