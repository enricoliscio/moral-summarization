SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has sparked outrage by suggesting that minority Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to other countries, with many condemning his remarks as racist and xenophobic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for a resolution denouncing Trump's characterization of immigrants, stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" is truly about making America white again. Trump's tweets targeted "The Squad," a group of four Muslim, Hispanic, and black freshmen House members: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. Three of these congresswomen were born in the United States, while Omar came as a refugee from Somalia. Trump's comments have united Democrats in their condemnation of his racial tactics, with Pelosi emphasizing that diversity is America's strength and unity its power. Internationally, Trump's remarks have been criticized, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language used unacceptable. Despite backlash, Trump stands by his comments, claiming that the congresswomen hate the United States and Israel, and that his statements don't concern him as many people agree with him. Republicans are also speaking out against Trump's attacks, with some calling his behavior unbecoming of the leader of the free world.
