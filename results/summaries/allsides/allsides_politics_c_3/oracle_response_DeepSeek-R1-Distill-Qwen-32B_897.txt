Alright, so the user has provided a detailed news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They've also given a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump's comments towards four Democratic congresswomen, which led to accusations of racism and xenophobia. The main elements are Trump's tweets, the reactions from Pelosi and other Democrats, some Republican responses, and international criticism.

I should identify the morally charged words from the article and ensure they're included in the summary. Words like racism, hate, xenophobic, divide, disgusting, etc., are crucial. I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's actions, the accusations against him, and the reactions from both Democrats and Republicans.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's tweets, Pelosi's response, the Squad's reaction, Republican criticism, and international condemnation. Then, I'll weave in the moral terms naturally.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to summarizing the events and the moral framing as presented. Making sure each key point is covered without going into too much detail. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all important elements are included and the moral language is preserved.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Trump's "xenophobic" remarks, calling them a threat to American diversity and unity. Pelosi urged Republicans to join Democrats in condemning Trump's tactics. The congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, responded by accusing Trump of racism and degradation.

Trump's tweets united Democrats in opposition, highlighting the divide in American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
