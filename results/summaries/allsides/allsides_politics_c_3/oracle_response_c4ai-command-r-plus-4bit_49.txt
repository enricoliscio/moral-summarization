SUMMARY: President Donald Trump's racist comments sparked outrage among Democrats and some Republicans alike, with calls for a resolution condemning his remarks. Trump told minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries, despite most of them being born in the US. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments "xenophobic," stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" was about making America white again. Pelosi's statement highlighted the importance of diversity and unity. Trump's tweets were directed at four Muslim, Hispanic, and black House freshmen members known as "the Squad," three of whom were born in the US, and one who came as a refugee. The congresswomen responded by calling out Trump's racism and vowing to continue fighting corruption and holding his administration accountable. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Some Republicans joined the condemnation, calling Trump's tweets racist, xenophobic, and unbecoming of the leader of the free world. This incident united Democrats in their condemnation of Trump's racial tactics and highlighted the moral issues at stake in the political discourse.
