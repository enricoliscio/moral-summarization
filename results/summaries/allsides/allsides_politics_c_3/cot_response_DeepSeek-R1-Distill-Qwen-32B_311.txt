Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump making controversial comments about four Democratic congresswomen, leading to a political and moral backlash.

The user has specific instructions: identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those terms. I'll start by going through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "racism," "condemning," "apologize," "xenophobic," "hate," "strength," "corruption," "degrade," "abandoned," "unbecoming," and "disgusting" stand out as they relate to moral judgments.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should mention Trump's comments, the reaction from Democrats and some Republicans, and the international criticism. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the original tone. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but comprehensive.

I'll start with Trump's tweets, then move to Pelosi's response, the Squad's reaction, international and Republican criticism, and end with the political implications. Each section will incorporate the identified moral terms to reflect the article's framing accurately.
