Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about President Trump's comments towards four Democratic congresswomen. He told them to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the US. He denied the comments were racist, saying if they don't like the country, they can leave. The congresswomen, known as "The Squad," are from diverse backgrounds, including Muslim, Hispanic, and black. They reacted by pointing out the racism and xenophobia in his words.

House Speaker Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, calling them xenophobic and saying they reflect a desire to make America white again. Some Republicans also criticized Trump, with Rep. Will Hurd calling the tweets racist and unbecoming of a world leader. Others like Sen. Toomey and Rep. Amash also condemned the comments, highlighting the validity of their citizenship.

The moral framing here is clear: Trump's comments are seen as racist and xenophobic, dividing the country. The summary needs to capture this, showing the criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as well as the congresswomen's reactions. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points: Trump's comments, his denial, the congresswomen's backgrounds, Pelosi's response, and Republican criticism. Also, note the international reaction and Trump's implication linking the Squad to Democrats.
