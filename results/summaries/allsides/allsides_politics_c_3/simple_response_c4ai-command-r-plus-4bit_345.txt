SUMMARY: President Donald Trump faced widespread criticism and accusations of racism after suggesting that four minority Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to other countries. Three of the targeted lawmakers, known as "the Squad," were born in the United States, while the fourth came to the country as a refugee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's xenophobic remarks, stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" was truly about "making America white again." British Prime Minister Theresa May also denounced Trump's language as unacceptable. Despite the backlash, Trump stood by his comments, claiming that the congresswomen hated the United States and Israel. Some Republicans joined the condemnation, with Rep. Will Hurd calling Trump's behavior "unbecoming of the leader of the free world." This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between Trump and the Squad, as well as the fractures within the Democratic Party.
