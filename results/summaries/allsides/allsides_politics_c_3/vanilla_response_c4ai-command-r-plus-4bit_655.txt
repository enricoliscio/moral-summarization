SUMMARY: President Donald Trump denied that his comments telling minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries were racist. Three of the four congresswomen Trump attacked were born in the United States, and the fourth came to the US as a refugee from Somalia. Trump claimed that the congresswomen "hate" the US and Israel and said that "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on lawmakers to pass a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, calling them "xenophobic." The four congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded to Trump's tweets with their own criticism. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." Some Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and xenophobic.
END OF SUMMARY.
