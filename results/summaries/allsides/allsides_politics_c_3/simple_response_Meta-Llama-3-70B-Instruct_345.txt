SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" the US, they can leave. House Democrats condemned Trump's remarks, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling them "xenophobic" and saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley saying "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language. A growing number of Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." The incident highlights Trump's divisive rhetoric and the moral imperative for leaders to condemn racism and xenophobia.
