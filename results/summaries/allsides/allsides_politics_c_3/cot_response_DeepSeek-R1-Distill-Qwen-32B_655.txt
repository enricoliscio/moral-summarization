Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want a two-step process: first, identify all the morally framed words, and then write a summary using those words.

Looking at the article, it's about President Trump's comments towards some congresswomen, leading to a political and moral debate. I need to extract the words that carry moral connotations. Words like "racism," "condemning," "xenophobic," "hate," "apologize," etc., stand out as they carry strong moral implications.

Once I have those words, I need to craft a concise summary that includes as many of them as possible. The summary should capture the essence of the conflict, Trump's stance, the reactions from Democrats and some Republicans, and the international criticism. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, highlighting the moral aspects without adding any personal opinions.

I should also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the events and the various perspectives presented in the article. It's important to mention the key players like Pelosi, the Squad members, and the Republican reactions. Including international criticism adds another layer to the moral framing.

I think I've got all the necessary elements. Time to put it all together, making sure the summary is clear and sticks to the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump faced criticism for making xenophobic and racist remarks targeting four minority Democratic congresswomen, including calling them to "go back" to their countries. Trump denied racism, claiming those unhappy with the U.S. could leave. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned his comments, calling them xenophobic and a reflection of his plan to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "The Squad," strongly reacted, with Ayanna Pressley calling the remarks "what racism looks like." Trump's tweets also drew international condemnation, with British Prime Minister Theresa May deeming the language "completely unacceptable." While some Republicans criticized Trump's behavior, others remained silent. The controversy highlighted divisions over race, immigration, and national identity. END OF SUMMARY.
