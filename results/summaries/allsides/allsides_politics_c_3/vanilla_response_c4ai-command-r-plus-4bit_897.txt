SUMMARY: President Donald Trump faced backlash from House Democrats and international critics after making racist comments towards four minority Democratic congresswomen, suggesting they should "go back" to other countries. Three of the four congresswomen were born in the US, and Trump's comments were widely interpreted as racist and xenophobic. Trump denied the accusations of racism and instead claimed the congresswomen "hate" the US and Israel. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, while the targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," also criticized the President's comments. Some Republicans also spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and unbecoming of the President. Trump's tweets have united Democrats in condemning his racial tactics, and the incident has brought attention to his attempts to link the Squad to the Democratic Party as a whole.
END OF SUMMARY.
