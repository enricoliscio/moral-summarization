SUMMARY: President Donald Trump faced backlash from Democrats and some Republicans for his racist comments towards four minority Democratic congresswomen, telling them to "go back" to other countries. Three of the four lawmakers were born in the United States, and Trump's remarks were widely condemned as xenophobic and racist. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, while the targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," strongly criticized the president's comments. Trump denied his statements were racist and instead claimed that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Meanwhile, some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and unbecoming of the president.
