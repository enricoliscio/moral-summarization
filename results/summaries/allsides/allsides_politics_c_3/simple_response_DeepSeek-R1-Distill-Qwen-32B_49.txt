Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The user mentioned they want a news summary that maintains the moral perspective, so I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications.

First, the article is about President Trump's comments targeting four Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad." He told them to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the U.S. The moral issue here is racism and xenophobia. I need to highlight that.

Next, the article mentions Trump denying his comments were racist and suggesting they should leave if they don't like the country. This is a key point because it's about divisiveness and exclusion, which are moral issues.

Then, the Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are condemning Trump's remarks as xenophobic. They argue that diversity is a strength, which is a moral stance against Trump's exclusionary rhetoric.

Some Republicans are also criticizing Trump, which is interesting because it shows even within his party, there's concern about the moral implications of his words.

I should also include the reactions from the congresswomen themselves, like Ayanna Pressley calling out the racism, and Rashida Tlaib's response about fighting corruption in the U.S.

Additionally, international criticism, like from the UK, adds to the moral dimension, showing that the issue is not just domestic but has global implications.

Finally, Trump's attempt to link the congresswomen to the Democratic party more broadly and his focus on the Middle East as a flashpoint is another moral angle, as it's about political strategy versus ethical leadership.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these moral elements without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's actions, then the reactions from Democrats, Republicans, and the congresswomen, and touch on the broader implications.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump faced widespread condemnation after tweeting that four minority Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad," should "go back" to their countries, despite most being U.S.-born. Trump denied his comments were racist, telling reporters, "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's "xenophobic" remarks, stating, "our diversity is our strength." Trump's comments sparked international criticism, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language "completely unacceptable." Some Republicans, like Rep. Will Hurd, also criticized Trump, labeling his tweets as "racist and xenophobic." The congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, responded by denouncing Trump's rhetoric as racist and reaffirming their commitment to fighting for their communities. Trump's remarks were seen as an attempt to divide the country and attack Democrats' support for diversity and inclusion. END OF SUMMARY.
