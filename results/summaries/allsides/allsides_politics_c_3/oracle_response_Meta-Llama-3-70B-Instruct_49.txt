SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage with racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" the country, they can leave. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Trump's "xenophobic" remarks, saying they reflect his plan to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language. Even some Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." The incident highlights Trump's divisive tactics and his willingness to degrade and attack minority lawmakers. His comments were widely condemned as disgusting and unbecoming of a president.
