Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about President Trump's tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad." He told them to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the U.S. This caused a lot of backlash. House Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are calling for a resolution condemning his remarks as racist and xenophobic. Trump denied the accusations, saying it's about people who don't like the country leaving. He also criticized their support for Israel. Some Republicans, like Will Hurd and Pat Toomey, are speaking out against Trump's comments, calling them racist and unbecoming of a leader. The congresswomen themselves reacted by pointing out the hypocrisy and racism in Trump's statements.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: Trump's tweets, the reaction from Democrats and some Republicans, the moral condemnation, and the context that most were U.S.-born. I should keep it under 200 words and include the moral framing, like racism and xenophobia.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Trump's tweets and their content.
2. The congresswomen's background (most U.S.-born).
3. Pelosi's response and the resolution.
4. Trump's denial and his comments on Israel.
5. Republican reactions against Trump.
6. The congresswomen's responses.
7. International criticism and the impact on unity.

I need to make sure each point is concise and flows logically. Also, highlight the moral aspects like racism and xenophobia as emphasized in the article.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without exceeding the word limit.
