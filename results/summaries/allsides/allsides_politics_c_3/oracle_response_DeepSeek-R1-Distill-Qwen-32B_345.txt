Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about President Trump's comments towards some Democratic congresswomen, and the reactions from various people, including Democrats, Republicans, and international figures. 

First, I should identify the key points. Trump called on four minority congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, which he later denied as racist. He said if they don't like the country, they can leave, even though most were born here. Pelosi and others condemned his remarks as racist and xenophobic. The congresswomen, known as "The Squad," reacted by calling out the racism and Trump's tactics. Some Republicans also criticized Trump, saying his comments were unbecoming of a leader.

The author used specific moral terms like racism, hate, xenophobic, divide, disgusting, etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's tweets, his denial, Pelosi's response, the congresswomen's reactions, and Republican criticism. Then, I'll incorporate the moral terms to frame the summary correctly.

I should ensure that the summary flows well, covers all key points, and uses the specified moral language. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is preserved.

Wait, the user provided a sample summary, so I should make sure my summary is similar in structure and includes all the necessary moral terms. I'll check off each term as I include them to ensure none are missed.

Alright, I think I have a clear plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it within 200 words and making sure it captures all the essential elements with the correct moral framing.
