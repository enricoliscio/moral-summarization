SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has come under fire for his racist comments towards four Democratic congresswomen, known as "the Squad," suggesting that they should "go back" to the "crime infested places" they came from. Three of the four lawmakers were born in the United States, and the fourth, Ilhan Omar, came to the country as a refugee from Somalia. Trump's remarks have been widely condemned, including by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called for a resolution condemning the president's xenophobic rhetoric. The president has denied that his comments were racist, claiming that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. However, his attempts to link the lawmakers to Democrats in general and his characterization of their views on the Middle East have been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." This incident highlights the ongoing moral debate in American politics, with many calling for a rejection of Trump's divisive and racist rhetoric.
