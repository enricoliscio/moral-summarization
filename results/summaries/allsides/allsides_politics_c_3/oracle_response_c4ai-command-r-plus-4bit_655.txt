SUMMARY: President Trump's recent racist remarks sparked outrage among Democrats and some Republicans. Trump told minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to other countries, despite most of them being born in the United States. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called for a resolution condemning Trump's characterization of immigrants and his xenophobic tweets. Pelosi described Trump's comments as an attempt to "make America white again," emphasizing that diversity is America's strength. Three of the four congresswomen attacked by Trump's tweets—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib—were born in the US, while Ilhan Omar came to the US as a refugee from Somalia. The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," have criticized Trump for his hateful and divisive language. They are fighting corruption and holding the administration accountable for degrading and attacking their communities. Internationally, Trump's tweets were criticized as well, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language used towards the congresswomen unacceptable. Some Republicans also denounced Trump's comments as racist, xenophobic, and unbecoming of the leader of the free world. This incident highlights the ongoing battle against racism and the need for unity in the face of divisive tactics.
