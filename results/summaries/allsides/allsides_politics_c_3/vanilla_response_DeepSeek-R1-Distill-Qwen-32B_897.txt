Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's happening. The article is about President Trump's comments towards some Democratic congresswomen, specifically the "Squad." He told them to "go back" to their countries, which they responded to, and there's a lot of reaction from both Democrats and some Republicans.

First, I should identify the main points. Trump made controversial tweets targeting four minority women in Congress. He suggested they should leave the country, even though most were born here. He denied the comments were racist. House Speaker Pelosi called for a resolution condemning his remarks, calling them xenophobic. The congresswomen, including Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, reacted by pointing out the racism and that they were born in the U.S. Some Republicans also criticized Trump, saying his tweets were racist and not fitting for a leader.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Trump's tweets, his denial of racism, Pelosi's response, the congresswomen's reactions, and the Republican criticism. I should also note that the women are from diverse backgrounds, including a refugee.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's tweets, his denial, Pelosi's call for a resolution, the women's reactions, and then the Republican response. Keep it concise, making sure to include key details without getting too wordy.

Wait, I should also include that Trump linked their views on the Middle East as an issue, and that some Republicans criticized him, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey. Also, mention that the congresswomen were born in the U.S., except Ilhan Omar, who came as a refugee.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
