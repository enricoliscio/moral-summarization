SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump has sparked outrage among House Democrats and international critics with his recent racist remarks towards minority Democratic congresswomen. In a series of tweets, Trump targeted "The Squad," a group of four Muslim, Hispanic, and black House freshmen members: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. Trump suggested that these lawmakers, three of whom were born in the United States, should "go back" to the "crime-infested places from which they came." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's xenophobic characterization of immigrants, stating that his hateful rhetoric reflects a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen themselves and other lawmakers, including some Republicans, have strongly denounced Trump's comments as racist, unacceptable, and disgusting. Pelosi's call for condemnation has united Democrats, despite previous clashes with "The Squad," highlighting the moral imperative to stand against Trump's divisive and racist language.
