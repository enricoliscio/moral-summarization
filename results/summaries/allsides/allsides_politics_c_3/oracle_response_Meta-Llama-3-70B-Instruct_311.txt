SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's remarks as "xenophobic" and "racist," saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." The incident highlights Trump's divisive tactics and his willingness to use hateful language to degrade and attack his political opponents.
