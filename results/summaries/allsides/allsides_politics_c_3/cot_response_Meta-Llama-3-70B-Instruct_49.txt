SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump sparked outrage with his racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's remarks as "xenophobic" and "racist," with Pelosi stating that Trump's plan is to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted strongly, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." A growing number of Republicans have spoken out against Trump's attacks, with Rep. Will Hurd calling the tweets "racist, and xenophobic" and "unbecoming of the leader of the free world."
