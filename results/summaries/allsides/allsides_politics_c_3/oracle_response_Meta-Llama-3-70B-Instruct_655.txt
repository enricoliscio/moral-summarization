SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage with racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" America, they can leave. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, saying they reflect a "xenophobic" plan to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted strongly, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also condemned Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." Even some Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd, spoke out against Trump's "racist" and "xenophobic" tweets, saying they are "unbecoming of the leader of the free world." The incident highlights Trump's divisive tactics and hateful rhetoric, which have sparked widespread criticism.
