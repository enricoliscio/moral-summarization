SUMMARY: President Donald Trump sparked outrage by suggesting that minority Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to other countries, despite most of his targets being born in the United States. Trump's comments were widely condemned as racist and xenophobic, including by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called for a resolution condemning his remarks. The president denied any racism, claiming that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. The targeted lawmakers, known as "the Squad," include Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, who have been critical of both Trump and the Democratic leadership. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Some Republicans have joined the condemnation, with Rep. Will Hurd calling Trump's behavior "unbecoming of the leader of the free world." This incident highlights the increasing polarization in American politics, with Trump seeking to link "The Squad" to the Democratic Party as a whole.
END OF SUMMARY.
