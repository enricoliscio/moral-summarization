SUMMARY:
House Democrats called for a resolution condemning President Donald Trump's racist remarks towards minority Democratic congresswomen. Trump told the congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, to "go back" to the "crime infested places" they came from. He later denied that his comments were racist, claiming that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on lawmakers to condemn Trump's xenophobic characterization of immigrants, stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" was really about "making America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded by calling out Trump's racism and vowing to continue fighting corruption and degradation in the United States. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Some Republicans joined the condemnation, calling Trump's tweets racist, xenophobic, and unbecoming of a leader. The incident has united Democrats in their criticism of Trump's racial tactics and has drawn international attention.
