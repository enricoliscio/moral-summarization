SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" the US and Israel, they can leave. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, labeling them "xenophobic" and saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, with one calling Trump's words "what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also condemned Trump's language. A growing number of Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." The incident highlights the deepening racial and political divisions in the US.
