SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has sparked outrage after telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the US. Trump denied his comments were racist, saying if they're not happy in the US, they can leave. House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks as racist and xenophobic. The targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," have responded, with one calling Trump's comments "what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, have also criticized Trump's language. Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, have spoken out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "wrong." The controversy has united Democrats in condemnation of Trump's racial tactics.
