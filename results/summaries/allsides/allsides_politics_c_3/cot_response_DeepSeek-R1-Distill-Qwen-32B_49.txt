Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a concise summary.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "condemning," "racism," "apologize," "hate," "xenophobic," "condemning," "degrade," "unbecoming," "racist," "disgusting," and "strength" stand out as they relate to moral judgments.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. I'll start by outlining the main events: Trump's tweets, the reactions from Democrats and some Republicans, and the international criticism. I should mention Pelosi's response, the Squad's reaction, and the criticism from Republicans like Hurd and Amash. I'll also include Trump's denial and the broader implications of his comments.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by using words like "condemned," "xenophobic," "racist," and "strength" as they appear in the original text.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to show the conflict, reactions, and the broader impact of Trump's remarks, ensuring it's concise and captures the essence of the article within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump faced widespread condemnation after tweeting that four minority Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad," should "go back" to their countries, despite most being U.S.-born. Trump denied his comments were racist, telling reporters, "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Trump's "xenophobic" remarks, stating, "The House cannot allow the Presidentâ€™s characterization of immigrants to stand." The congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, responded by calling out Trump's racism. Some Republicans, like Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, also criticized Trump's comments as "racist" and "xenophobic." Trump defended his remarks, claiming the congresswomen "hate" the U.S. and Israel. The incident sparked international criticism and highlighted the divide over Trump's rhetoric, with Pelosi emphasizing that "our diversity is our strength." END OF SUMMARY.
