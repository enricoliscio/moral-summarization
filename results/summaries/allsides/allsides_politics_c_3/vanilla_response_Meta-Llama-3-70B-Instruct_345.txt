SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has sparked outrage after telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the US. Trump denied his comments were racist, saying that if they're not happy in the US, they can leave. House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are calling for a resolution to condemn Trump's remarks, labeling them as xenophobic and racist. The four congresswomen, known as "the Squad," have spoken out against Trump's attacks, with one calling it "what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, have also criticized Trump's language. Some Republicans have broken with Trump, calling his tweets "racist" and "xenophobic." Trump has defended his comments, saying many people agree with him, and has hinted that he will link the congresswomen to Democrats in the 2020 election.
