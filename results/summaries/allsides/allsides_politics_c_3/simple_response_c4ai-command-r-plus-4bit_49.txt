SUMMARY: President Donald Trump attacked four minority Democratic congresswomen known as "the Squad," saying they should "go back" to other countries if they are not happy with the United States. His comments have been widely condemned as racist and xenophobic, including by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks. Three of the four lawmakers targeted—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib—were born in the United States, while Ilhan Omar came to the country as a refugee from Somalia. Trump's tweets united Democrats in their condemnation of his racial tactics, and also drew international criticism, including from British Prime Minister Theresa May. Some Republicans have also spoken out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and unbecoming of the leader of the free world. Trump has denied that his comments were racist and instead accused the congresswomen of hating the United States and Israel. Pelosi countered that Trump's plan to "Make America Great Again" has always been about making America white again, emphasizing that diversity is America's strength.
