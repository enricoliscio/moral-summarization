SUMMARY: President Donald Trump attacked four minority Democratic congresswomen in a series of racist tweets, suggesting that they should "go back" to other countries. Three of the targeted lawmakers, known as "the Squad," were born in the United States, while Rep. Ilhan Omar came to the country as a refugee from Somalia. Trump's comments sparked widespread condemnation, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called for a resolution to condemn his xenophobic characterization of immigrants. Pelosi described Trump's plan to "Make America Great Again" as an attempt to "make America white again," highlighting the importance of diversity. The president denied that his remarks were racist, claiming that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Despite the backlash, Trump indicated he would continue to link "The Squad" with the Democratic Party, particularly on issues related to the Middle East. Several Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, have spoken out against Trump's racist and divisive behavior. Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, described Trump's attacks as "racist and disgusting."
