SUMMARY:
President Donald Trump sparked outrage with his racist and xenophobic tweets, telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on lawmakers to pass a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, saying "the House cannot allow the President's characterization of immigrants to our country to stand." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," reacted strongly, with Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeting "THIS is what racism looks like." International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language as "completely unacceptable." A growing number of Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic." END OF SUMMARY.
