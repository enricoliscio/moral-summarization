Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the context. It's about President Trump's comments towards four Democratic congresswomen, which were condemned as racist and xenophobic.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, like racism, hate, diversity, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll identify the key points: Trump told the congresswomen to "go back," denied racism, called their comments foul. Pelosi wanted a resolution condemning his remarks, calling them xenophobic. The congresswomen reacted, some Republicans also criticized Trump.

I need to structure this into a summary, making sure to include the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Trump's comments and denial, then Pelosi's response, the congresswomen's reactions, and the Republican reactions. I'll also highlight the international criticism and the implications of Trump's tactics.

I should keep each sentence focused, using the moral terms where appropriate. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.
