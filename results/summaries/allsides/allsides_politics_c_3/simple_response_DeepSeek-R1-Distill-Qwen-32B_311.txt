Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump making controversial comments about some Democratic congresswomen, leading to a lot of reactions from both sides.

I notice that the article mentions Trump telling the congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the U.S. This is clearly a sensitive issue, and the moral framing is around racism and xenophobia. Pelosi and others are calling out Trump for his comments, which is a strong moral stance against his actions.

Next, I need to identify the key points: Trump's comments, the reaction from Democrats, the response from some Republicans, and the international criticism. It's important to highlight that Trump denied the comments were racist, which adds another layer to the moral argument.

I should also note that the congresswomen, known as "The Squad," are from diverse backgrounds, which emphasizes the issue of diversity and inclusion. Pelosi's statement about making America white again is a significant moral critique.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral stances taken by the parties involved. I'll make sure to include Trump's denial, Pelosi's condemnation, the congresswomen's reactions, and the Republican responses, especially those who criticized Trump.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's comments, the reactions from Democrats, the congresswomen's responses, Republican reactions, and international criticism. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump sparked controversy by telling four Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad," to "go back" to their countries, despite most being U.S.-born. Trump denied his comments were racist, stating, "if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Trump's remarks as xenophobic, asserting, "Our diversity is our strength." The congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, responded by denouncing Trump's racism. Some Republicans, like Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, also criticized Trump's comments as racist and unbecoming of a leader. International figures, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, condemned the remarks. Trump defended his comments, claiming the congresswomen "hate" the U.S. and Israel, and suggested their views reflect broader Democratic policies. The incident highlights ongoing tensions over immigration, race, and national identity in U.S. politics. END OF SUMMARY.
