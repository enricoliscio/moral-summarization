SUMMARY: House Democrats called on lawmakers to condemn President Donald Trump for his racist remarks towards minority Democratic congresswomen. Trump suggested that these lawmakers, most of whom were born in the United States, should "go back" to other countries, and denied that his comments were racist. He claimed that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel, and his remarks were widely criticized as racist and xenophobic. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has clashed with the targeted lawmakers in the past, called on Republicans to join Democrats in condemning Trump's characterization of immigrants. The congresswomen, known as "The Squad," responded by calling out Trump's racism and reaffirming their commitment to fighting corruption and holding his administration accountable. Internationally, Trump's tweets were also condemned, including by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Some Republicans spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and unbecoming of the leader of the free world. The incident united Democrats in their condemnation of Trump's racial tactics and highlighted the diversity and unity of the party. It also drew attention to the president's attempt to link the views of "The Squad" with those of Democrats in general.
