SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, despite most of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" the US, they can leave. House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's remarks as xenophobic and racist, with Pelosi stating that Trump's plan is to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, calling Trump's comments racist and xenophobic. International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language. A growing number of Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "unbecoming of the leader of the free world." The incident highlights the divisive and harmful rhetoric used by Trump, which has been widely condemned as morally reprehensible.
