SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked controversy by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the US. Trump denied his comments were racist, saying that if they hate the US, they can leave. House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks as xenophobic and racist. The targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded strongly, with one calling Trump's comments "what racism looks like." International criticism also mounted, with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the language "completely unacceptable." Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and xenophobic. The controversy has united Democrats in condemnation of Trump's racial tactics.
