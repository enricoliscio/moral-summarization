SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked outrage by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the United States. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if they "hate" the US, they can leave. House Democrats condemned Trump's remarks as xenophobic and racist, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, calling Trump's comments racist and xenophobic. International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's language. Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "unbecoming of the leader of the free world." The incident highlights the divisive and racist rhetoric used by Trump, which has been widely condemned by Democrats and some Republicans.
