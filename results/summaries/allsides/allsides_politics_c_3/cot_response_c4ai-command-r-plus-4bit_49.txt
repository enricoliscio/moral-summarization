SUMMARY: 
President Donald Trump denied accusations of racism and xenophobia after suggesting that minority Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to other countries if they "hate" the United States. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's remarks, arguing that his comments reflected a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, known as "the Squad," include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, three of whom were born in the US. While Trump stood by his comments, claiming that his language did not concern him, Democrats and some Republicans united in their condemnation of his racial rhetoric. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. The incident highlighted Trump's efforts to link the Squad's views with those of Democrats in general, particularly regarding Israel, and reflected a broader strategy to exploit racial divisions for political gain. The episode underscores the moral dilemma faced by lawmakers in balancing the need to unite versus divide in the face of racially charged rhetoric.
