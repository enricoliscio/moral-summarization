Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

So, the article is about President Trump's comments towards some Democratic congresswomen. He told them to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the US. House Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are calling for a resolution condemning his remarks as racist and xenophobic.

I should note the key points: Trump's tweets, the reaction from Pelosi, the Squad's response, international criticism, and some Republican reactions.

I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's comments and the Democrats' response. Then, include Pelosi's statement. Next, the Squad's reaction, their backgrounds, and Trump's denial of racism. Also, mention the international criticism and some Republicans speaking out against him.

I should make sure to include that three of the four were born in the US, and that Trump linked their views on the Middle East. Also, note that some Republicans like Will Hurd and Pat Toomey criticized Trump's tweets.

Putting it all together, I'll structure it to cover Trump's actions, the Democrats' response, the Squad's reactions, international and Republican criticism, and the political implications.

I should keep each sentence concise and avoid any unnecessary details. Make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next without getting bogged down in specifics.

Double-checking the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Okay, looks good. I think this captures the main points effectively.
