Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about President Trump's comments towards four Democratic congresswomen, known as "The Squad." He told them to "go back" to their countries, even though most were born in the U.S. He denied the comments were racist and said if they don't like the country, they can leave. The congresswomen and House Speaker Pelosi condemned his remarks as racist and xenophobic.

I should highlight Trump's actions, the reaction from Democrats, and the moral implications. The author frames Trump's comments as xenophobic and racist, so I need to include that perspective. Also, mention the bipartisan criticism, including some Republicans speaking out.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's comments, then the congresswomen's origins, his denial, Pelosi's response, and the reactions from both parties. Make sure to emphasize the moral framing against racism and xenophobia.

Let me structure it: Trump's tweets, the women's backgrounds, his denial, Pelosi's criticism, the Squad's reactions, international and Republican responses, and the implications for the election.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each point is brief but covers the key moral points the author made.
