SUMMARY: President Donald Trump faced backlash from House Democrats and some Republicans after tweeting that minority Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to other countries if they "hate" America. Three of the four congresswomen he targeted were born in the US, and the fourth came as a refugee from Somalia. Trump denied his comments were racist and instead called for the congresswomen to apologize for their "foul language" and "terrible things they have said." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's "xenophobic" remarks, stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" was about "making America white again." The targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded by calling out Trump's racism and defending their work to hold his administration accountable. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as "unacceptable." Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and xenophobic.
END OF SUMMARY.
