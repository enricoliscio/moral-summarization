SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump sparked controversy by telling four minority Democratic congresswomen to "go back" to their countries of origin, despite three of them being born in the US. Trump denied his comments were racist, claiming that if someone hates the US, they can leave. House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump's remarks as xenophobic and racist. The targeted congresswomen, known as "the Squad," responded with outrage, calling Trump's language racist. International leaders, such as British Prime Minister Theresa May, also criticized Trump's comments. Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, spoke out against Trump's attacks, calling them racist and unbecoming of a leader. The controversy has united Democrats in condemnation of Trump's racial tactics, with Pelosi saying that Trump's plan to "Make America Great Again" is actually about making America white again.
