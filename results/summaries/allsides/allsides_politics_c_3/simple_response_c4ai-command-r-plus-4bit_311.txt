SUMMARY: President Donald Trump's racist remarks towards four minority Democratic congresswomen, known as "the Squad," have sparked widespread condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. Trump suggested that these lawmakers, three of whom were born in the United States, should "go back" to the "crime infested places from which they came." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution condemning Trump's xenophobic comments, stating that his plan to "Make America Great Again" was truly about "making America white again." British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. Some Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, denounced Trump's comments as racist and xenophobic. Trump denied any racism and claimed that the congresswomen "hate" the United States and Israel. The incident has united Democrats in their criticism of Trump's racial tactics and has drawn international attention.
