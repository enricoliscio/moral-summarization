SUMMARY: President Trump's recent tweets directed at four minority Democratic congresswomen have sparked widespread backlash and accusations of racism and xenophobia. In his tweets, Trump suggested that the congresswomen, known as "the Squad," should "go back" to the "crime infested places from which they came," despite three of the four being born in the United States. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a resolution to condemn Trump's remarks, characterizing them as a xenophobic attack on immigrants. She emphasized that the House cannot allow the President's hateful and divisive language to stand and that Republicans must join Democrats in denouncing his comments. Trump, however, denied any racism, claiming that his statements were directed at the congresswomen's alleged hatred for the United States and Israel. The tweets have united Democrats in their condemnation of Trump's racial tactics, with some Republicans also speaking out against the President's behavior. Internationally, British Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized Trump's language as unacceptable. This incident underscores the growing concerns about Trump's divisive rhetoric and its potential impact on the country's social fabric.
