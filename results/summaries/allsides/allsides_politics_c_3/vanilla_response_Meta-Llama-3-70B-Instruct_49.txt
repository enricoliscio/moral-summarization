SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has sparked outrage by suggesting that four minority Democratic congresswomen, known as "the Squad," should "go back" to their countries of origin. Despite three of them being born in the US, Trump tweeted that they should leave and fix the "totally broken and crime infested places" they came from. House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have condemned Trump's remarks as racist and xenophobic. Pelosi has called for a resolution to condemn Trump's comments, saying they reflect a desire to "make America white again." The congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, have responded with outrage, calling Trump's tweets racist and divisive. International leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, have also criticized Trump's language. Some Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd and Sen. Pat Toomey, have spoken out against Trump's attacks, calling them "racist" and "xenophobic."
