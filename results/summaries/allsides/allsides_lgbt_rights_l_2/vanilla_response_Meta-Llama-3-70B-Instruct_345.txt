SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, is anxiously awaiting a new ruling from the Supreme Court. This time, the court is considering three cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals who were fired from their jobs because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Obergefell notes that despite the progress made in marriage equality, many LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in their home states, particularly in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. He argues that a win in these employment discrimination cases would be a significant step forward, but that comprehensive protections are still needed in all areas of life. Obergefell also urges lawmakers to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, citing a proposed nondiscrimination bill in his home state of Ohio as an opportunity for progress.
