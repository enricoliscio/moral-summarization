Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the emotional tone.

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in Obergefell v. Hodges, is discussing his experiences and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He mentions the initial victory in the marriage equality case but now faces anxiety over new Supreme Court cases regarding employment discrimination. The author highlights the lack of protections in many states, the fears of discrimination, and the need for comprehensive laws.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used, such as "freedom," "prevailed," "discrimination," "protections," etc. My summary should include as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure the summary to cover the key points: the past victory, current anxieties, the need for further legal protections, and the ongoing activism.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll start by mentioning the past victory, then move to the current cases, the lack of protections, and the call to action for legislation and community efforts.

I also need to remember to place the summary after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure the summary is clear and captures the urgency and hope expressed in the original article.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He recalls the freedom and justice brought by the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage but now anxiously awaits a Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases. Despite progress, discrimination remains a threat, with many LGBTQ+ individuals facing firing, harassment, and lack of protections. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws, ensuring dignity and equality in all areas of life. He calls for lawmakers to pass legislation, like the recently proposed bipartisan bill in Ohio, and urges continued activism, advocacy, and community organizing to protect LGBTQ+ people from harm. The fight for equality is ongoing, and together, we can ensure everyone is treated with respect and protected from unfair treatment, fulfilling the promise of "We the people." END OF SUMMARY.
