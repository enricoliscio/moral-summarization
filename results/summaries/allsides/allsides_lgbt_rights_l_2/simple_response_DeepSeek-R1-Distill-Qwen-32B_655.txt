Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is by Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage. He's talking about the current situation where LGBTQ+ people still face discrimination, especially in employment, and how the Supreme Court is considering cases about that. He mentions the importance of comprehensive nondiscrimination laws and his efforts in Ohio to get such legislation passed.

First, I should identify the main points. He starts by reflecting on the past victory of marriage equality and the current anxiety about the employment discrimination cases. He then discusses the lack of protections in many states, including his home state of Ohio, and the need for broader legal protections beyond just employment. He also talks about the proposed nondiscrimination bill in Ohio and the ongoing fight for equality.

I need to make sure the summary captures his moral stance, emphasizing justice, dignity, and the importance of legal protections. I should mention his role as the plaintiff, the current Supreme Court cases, the need for comprehensive laws, and his efforts in Ohio. Also, I should highlight his belief that everyone deserves respect and protection regardless of their identity.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well, starting with the reflection on past victories, moving to current anxieties, the need for more protections, and the ongoing efforts to achieve equality.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. While the Supreme Court’s marriage equality victory brought hope, discrimination remains a threat, particularly in employment. Obergefell highlights cases before the Court where LGBTQ+ individuals were fired due to their identity, emphasizing the need for explicit nondiscrimination protections. He notes that even a favorable ruling won’t solve all issues, as comprehensive protections are needed in housing, health care, and public spaces. Obergefell, now back in Ohio, advocates for state legislation to address this gap, citing a recently proposed bipartisan bill. He urges continued activism, education, and storytelling to ensure equality and dignity for all, regardless of identity. The fight for justice is far from over, but momentum is building for a future where everyone is protected. END OF SUMMARY.
