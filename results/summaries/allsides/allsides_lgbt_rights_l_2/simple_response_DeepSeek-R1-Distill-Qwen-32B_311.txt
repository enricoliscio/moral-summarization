Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The article is by Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage. He's talking about the current situation regarding LGBTQ+ rights, particularly employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court.

First, I should identify the main points. He's reflecting on past victories, like the marriage equality case, but now he's anxious about the upcoming Supreme Court decisions on employment discrimination. He mentions how discrimination still exists, even after the marriage victory, and how people are still facing issues like job losses because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

He also talks about the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states, which is a big concern. He emphasizes that a Supreme Court win would help but isn't the end of the fight. More comprehensive laws are needed in areas like housing, health, and public spaces. He's pushing for legislation, especially in his home state of Ohio, where such protections aren't in place. There's a bill proposed with bipartisan support, which is a positive sign.

The moral framing here is about justice, equality, and dignity. Obergefell is appealing to the idea that everyone deserves respect and protection, regardless of their identity. He's also highlighting the importance of collective actionâ€”pushing the courts, organizing communities, and educating lawmakers.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without losing the moral emphasis. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: past achievements, current anxieties about discrimination, the need for broader protections, and the call to action for lawmakers and the community.

I should structure it to start with his reflection on past victories, move to current concerns, the need for more protections, mention the Ohio legislation, and end with the call for ongoing efforts. I need to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly while maintaining the moral tone.
