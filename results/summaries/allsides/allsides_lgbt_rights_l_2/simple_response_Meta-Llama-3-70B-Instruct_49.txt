SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case, anxiously awaits a Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. He recalls the burden lifted when same-sex couples gained the freedom to marry, but notes that discrimination still threatens many. Without explicit nondiscrimination protections, LGBTQ+ individuals face job discrimination, harassment, and unfair treatment. A win in these cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view of nearly 70% of Americans that LGBTQ+ individuals should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a victory, comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Obergefell urges lawmakers to pass nondiscrimination legislation, like the proposed bill in his home state of Ohio, and encourages community organizing and education to ensure equal rights and dignity for all.

END OF SUMMARY.
