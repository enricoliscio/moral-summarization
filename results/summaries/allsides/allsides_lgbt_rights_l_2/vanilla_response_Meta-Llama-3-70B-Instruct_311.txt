SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, is anxiously awaiting a new Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. He recalls the feeling of relief when the court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, but notes that many LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in their daily lives, particularly in states without explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell shares stories of LGBTQ+ people who have been fired or harassed due to their identity, and emphasizes the need for comprehensive protections in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. He urges lawmakers to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, citing a proposed bill in his home state of Ohio as an opportunity for progress. Obergefell believes that momentum is building towards a future where all individuals are protected from discrimination, and encourages everyone to push forward for full dignity and equality.
