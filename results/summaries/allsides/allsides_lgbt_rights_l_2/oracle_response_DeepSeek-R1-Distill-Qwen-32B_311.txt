Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is by Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He's reflecting on the current state of LGBTQ+ rights, particularly regarding employment discrimination. He mentions waiting for the Supreme Court's decision on three cases where LGBTQ+ individuals were fired due to their identity or relationships. He talks about the progress made with marriage equality but points out that many states still lack nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell expresses concerns about ongoing discrimination and the need for comprehensive legal protections beyond employment, such as in housing and public spaces. He also mentions efforts in Ohio to pass a nondiscrimination bill and the importance of activism and advocacy in pushing for equality.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and captures the essence of Obergefell's message about the ongoing fight against discrimination and the need for legal protections.

I'll start by highlighting his role in the landmark case and his current anxiety about the Supreme Court cases. Then, I'll mention the lack of protections in many states and the various forms of discrimination people face. I'll emphasize the importance of a win in the cases and the need for broader protections. Finally, I'll touch on his advocacy efforts in Ohio and the call to action for everyone to push for equality.

I need to ensure that words like freedom, discrimination, protected, justice, etc., are included. I'll structure the summary to flow logically from past achievements to current challenges and future goals, maintaining the moral tone throughout.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. While the freedom to marry nationwide was a victory, discrimination remains a threat, with many states lacking explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court considers cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals fired due to their identity or relationships. A win in these cases could protect people from harm and uphold the principle that LGBTQ+ individuals deserve legal protection. However, broader protections in housing, health, and public spaces are still needed. Obergefell emphasizes the importance of activism, advocacy, and organizing to ensure dignity and equality for all. In Ohio, lawmakers have the chance to pass a nondiscrimination bill with bipartisan support, but progress remains slow. The fight for equality continues, and it is up to everyone to push for change, share stories, and ensure that all individuals can thrive without unfair treatment based on their LGBTQ+ identity. END OF SUMMARY.
