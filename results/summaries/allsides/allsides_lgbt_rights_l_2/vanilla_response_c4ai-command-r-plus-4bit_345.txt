SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case legalizing same-sex marriage, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He discusses the recent Supreme Court hearing on employment discrimination cases, where LGBTQ+ individuals faced job discrimination due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Despite the potential for a landmark victory, Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination protections in all areas of life, including housing, health, and public spaces. He highlights the lack of such protections in his home state of Ohio and the failure of the state legislature to address this issue. Obergefell calls for continued activism and education to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals are protected from discrimination and treated with dignity and respect. He concludes by expressing hope for a future where everyone is included in "We the people."
