SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, anxiously awaits a Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. He recalls the freedom and victory felt when same-sex couples won the right to marry nationwide, but notes that discrimination remains a threat. Many LGBTQ+ individuals still face harassment, lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections, and unfair treatment in their home states. A win in these cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ individuals should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, the fight for equal rights is not over. Lawmakers must pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in all areas of life, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Obergefell urges organizing, educating, and sharing stories to push forward and ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination, no matter where they live.

END OF SUMMARY.
