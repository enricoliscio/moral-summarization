Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author, Jim Obergefell, is reflecting on his experience with the Supreme Court and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He talks about past victories, current anxieties about employment discrimination cases, and the need for comprehensive protections. I should highlight his personal journey, the importance of the upcoming Supreme Court decisions, and the call for continued activism. I'll make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral emphasis on equality and dignity.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court considers cases involving employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, emphasizing the need for clear, comprehensive protections beyond workplace rights. Obergefell highlights the lack of legal safeguards in many states and calls for legislative action, such as Ohio's proposed nondiscrimination bill, to ensure dignity and equality for all. He urges continued activism, including advocating for the Supreme Court and engaging with lawmakers, to build momentum toward a future where everyone is protected from discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
