Alright, so I need to summarize this article by Jim Obergefell. Let me read through it carefully. He's talking about his experience being the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Now, he's anxious again because the Supreme Court is considering cases about LGBTQ+ employment discrimination. 

He mentions that while same-sex marriage was a big win, many states still lack explicit nondiscrimination protections. People are still facing discrimination in jobs, housing, etc. He hopes the Supreme Court will rule in favor of protecting LGBTQ+ individuals, but he knows more work is needed beyond that, like passing comprehensive laws. 

He also talks about moving back to Ohio, where such protections aren't in place, and how the state legislature hasn't passed the necessary legislation yet. There's a new bill proposed with bipartisan support, so there's hope. He emphasizes the importance of continuing the fight through advocacy and education.

I need to make sure the summary captures his anxiety about the Supreme Court cases, the lack of protections, the importance of the upcoming ruling, and the ongoing need for legislation. Also, mention his role as a plaintiff and his current efforts. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

Hodges case, reflects on the anxiety he felt awaiting the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision on same-sex marriage and now faces a similar unease as the court considers LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases.

Obergefell highlights the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws, emphasizing that the fight for equality is far from over. He calls for the Supreme Court to uphold LGBTQ+ rights and urges lawmakers, particularly in states like Ohio, to pass protective legislation.
