SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, anxiously awaits a new Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the victory of same-sex marriage, discrimination remains a threat, and many still face harassment, job loss, and lack of protections in their home states. A win in these cases would uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a victory, the fight for equal rights is far from over. Comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Lawmakers have another chance to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and it's up to all of us to push forward, educate, and share our stories to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their LGBTQ+ identity. Momentum is building towards a future where all are truly part of "We the people."

END OF SUMMARY.
