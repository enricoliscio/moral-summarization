SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, awaits a new Supreme Court ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. He recalls the anxiety of waiting for the marriage equality ruling four years ago, which brought freedom to marry nationwide. However, discrimination still threatens LGBTQ+ individuals, with many facing job discrimination and harassment. A win in these employment cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ individuals should be legally protected from discrimination. Even with a victory, comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Obergefell urges lawmakers to pass nondiscrimination legislation, citing a proposed bill in his home state of Ohio with bipartisan support. He emphasizes the need for continued activism and education to ensure full dignity and equality for all. END OF SUMMARY.
