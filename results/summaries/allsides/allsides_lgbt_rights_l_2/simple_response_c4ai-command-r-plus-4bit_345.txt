SUMMARY: Four years after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage equality, named plaintiff Jim Obergefell anxiously awaits another ruling from the Supreme Court on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. Despite the marriage equality victory, many LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in various aspects of their lives, including employment, housing, and public spaces. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community, not just in certain states, but nationwide. He shares his personal experiences and the ongoing fight for equal rights, highlighting the importance of educating lawmakers and sharing stories to create a future where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity. With bipartisan support for a nondiscrimination bill proposed in Ohio and momentum building across the country, Obergefell remains hopeful for a future where "We the people" truly includes everyone.
