SUMMARY: In 2015, Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, anxiously awaits another pivotal ruling from the Supreme Court. This time, the Court will decide on three cases concerning LGBTQ+ employment discrimination. Despite the victory in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and public accommodations. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination protections, highlighting the lack of such laws in his home state of Ohio. He advocates for a federal law that guarantees equal treatment and dignity for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. With ongoing legislative efforts and community organizing, Obergefell believes a future of true equality and inclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals is within reach. He urges continued activism and storytelling to ensure that everyone, regardless of their identity, is protected from discrimination and fully included in the idea of "We the people."
