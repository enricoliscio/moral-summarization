SUMMARY: I was the named plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that brought same-sex couples the freedom to marry nationwide. Now, the Supreme Court is considering another important case for the LGBTQ+ community, and I feel a similar sense of anxiety. Despite the victory in the marriage equality case, many LGBTQ+ people still face discrimination and lack explicit nondiscrimination protections in their states. I have heard stories of gay people having job offers rescinded, transgender people being fired, and bisexual people enduring harassment without intervention. A win in the current employment discrimination cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view that LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, we still need to pass comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including housing, health, and public spaces. As someone who recently moved back to Ohio, a state lacking these protections, I know firsthand the importance of this fight. Lawmakers have the chance to do the right thing and ensure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their LGBTQ+ identity. We must continue to push for equality and encourage the Supreme Court, our communities, and our lawmakers to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Together, we can build momentum and ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination and able to thrive as part of "We the people."
END OF SUMMARY.
