SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on three cases regarding employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the progress made with marriage equality, Obergefell highlights the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states, leading to various forms of discrimination in employment, housing, health facilities, and public spaces. He emphasizes the need for comprehensive legal protections, with nearly 70% of Americans supporting the view that LGBTQ+ people should be protected from discrimination. While awaiting the Supreme Court's decision, Obergefell also stresses the importance of community organizing, educating lawmakers, and sharing personal stories to ensure equality and dignity for all. He mentions a recent bipartisan effort in his home state of Ohio to pass nondiscrimination legislation and expresses hope for a future where everyone is included in "We the people."
