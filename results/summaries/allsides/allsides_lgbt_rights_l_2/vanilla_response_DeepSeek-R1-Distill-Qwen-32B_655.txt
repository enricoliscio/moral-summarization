Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so the goal is to provide a concise summary of the article. Let me read through the article first.

The article is by Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage. He's reflecting on the current state of LGBTQ+ rights, especially regarding employment discrimination. He mentions awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on cases where LGBTQ+ individuals were fired due to their identity. He talks about the progress made but notes that discrimination still exists, with many states lacking protections. He emphasizes the importance of the upcoming Supreme Court decision and the need for comprehensive laws beyond employment, like housing and public spaces. He also mentions his return to Ohio, where such protections aren't in place, and the recent bipartisan bill proposed there. He calls for ongoing advocacy and the importance of sharing stories to push for equality.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: Obergefell's role in the marriage case, the current employment discrimination cases, the lack of protections in many states, the significance of the Supreme Court ruling, the need for broader protections, and his call to action, including the situation in Ohio.

Let me structure this: start with Obergefell's background, mention the current cases, discuss the issues with discrimination, the importance of the ruling, the need for more protections, and conclude with his advocacy efforts and the situation in Ohio.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points succinctly. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include all key points concisely.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court considers cases involving employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. Obergefell highlights the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states, citing examples of discrimination in employment, housing, and public spaces. A favorable ruling could provide critical protections but would not eliminate the need for comprehensive laws. Obergefell, who recently returned to Ohio, a state without such protections, urges lawmakers to pass a proposed bipartisan nondiscrimination bill. He emphasizes the importance of ongoing advocacy, community organizing, and sharing personal stories to ensure equality for all. END OF SUMMARY.
