Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author, Jim Obergefell, talks about his experience as a plaintiff in the marriage equality case and the current cases about employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. He emphasizes the importance of legal protections and the ongoing fight for equality.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used and make sure to include them in the summary. Words like "freedom," "prevailed," "discrimination," "protected," "equality," etc., are crucial. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the past victory, current anxieties about employment discrimination cases, the lack of protections, and the call for comprehensive laws.

I'll structure the summary to start with the past victory, move to current anxieties, mention the lack of protections, and end with the call to action for lawmakers and the community. I'll ensure that the moral framing is clear and that the summary flows logically from past achievements to current challenges and future goals.

Now, putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that hits all these points while keeping it within the word limit and preserving the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, reflects on the historic victory for marriage equality and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court considers cases involving employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, emphasizing the need for legal protections to prevent harm and uphold dignity. Despite progress, many states lack comprehensive nondiscrimination laws, leaving individuals vulnerable to discrimination, harassment, and firing based on their identity. Obergefell highlights the importance of passing clear protections in areas like housing, health, and public spaces, urging lawmakers to act. He calls for collective efforts—through advocacy, education, and storytelling—to ensure equality and dignity for all, regardless of LGBTQ+ identity. The fight for justice continues, and together, society can build a future where everyone thrives as part of "We the people."  
END OF SUMMARY.
