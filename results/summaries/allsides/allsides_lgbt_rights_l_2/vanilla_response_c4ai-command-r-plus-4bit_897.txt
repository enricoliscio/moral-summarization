SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Despite the victory in marriage equality, discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals remains a pressing issue, with many states lacking explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell shares stories of LGBTQ+ individuals facing discrimination in employment, highlighting the need for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including housing, health facilities, and public spaces. He expresses hope that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of LGBTQ+ individuals in upcoming employment discrimination cases, but emphasizes that the fight for equality doesn't end there. Lawmakers also have a responsibility to pass nondiscrimination legislation, such as the bill proposed in Ohio with bipartisan support. Obergefell calls for continued activism, community organizing, and storytelling to ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination and that LGBTQ+ individuals are truly included in "We the people."
