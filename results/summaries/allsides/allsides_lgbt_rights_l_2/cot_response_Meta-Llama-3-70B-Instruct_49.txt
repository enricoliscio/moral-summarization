SUMMARY:
As the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, I anxiously await the Supreme Court's ruling on three LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. A win would bring justice and freedom from discrimination to many, upholding the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people deserve legal protection from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, our work won't be over. We need comprehensive protections in every area of life, including housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of who they are. Lawmakers have another chance to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and it's up to us to push forward every day, educating lawmakers and sharing our stories until all of us can thrive. Momentum is building towards a future where we are all truly part of "We the people."
