Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The author is Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage. He's talking about his experiences and current issues regarding LGBTQ+ discrimination.

He mentions feeling anxious again as he awaits a Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases. He points out that while same-sex marriage was a big win, many states still lack explicit nondiscrimination protections. People are still facing issues like job discrimination, firing after transitioning, and harassment without employer intervention.

He believes a win in these employment cases would help, but it's not enough. They need comprehensive protections in areas like housing and public spaces. He also talks about his home state, Ohio, which lacks these protections and how lawmakers have a chance to pass a nondiscrimination bill.

The summary needs to capture his main points: the current anxiety over the Supreme Court cases, the need for broader protections beyond employment, and the importance of state legislation. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed.
