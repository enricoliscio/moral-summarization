SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark US Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ equality. He expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court hears arguments in three cases regarding LGBTQ+ employment discrimination, highlighting the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states. Despite the potential for a landmark victory, Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including housing, health, and public spaces. He shares his personal experience of moving back to Ohio, a state lacking comprehensive nondiscrimination laws, and encourages lawmakers to pass such protections. Obergefell calls for continued activism and education to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals are treated with dignity, respected for who they are, and protected from unfair treatment. He remains hopeful that momentum is building towards a future where everyone is truly included in "We the people."
