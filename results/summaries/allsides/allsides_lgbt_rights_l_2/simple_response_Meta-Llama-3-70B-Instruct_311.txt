SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case, anxiously awaits the Supreme Court's ruling on three LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. He recalls the burden of fighting for marriage equality and now fears for the many LGBTQ+ individuals who still face discrimination in their daily lives, including in the workplace. Despite the progress made, many states lack explicit nondiscrimination protections, leaving LGBTQ+ people vulnerable to harm. A win in these cases would be a crucial step towards upholding the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, Obergefell emphasizes that the fight for equal rights is far from over, and comprehensive protections are needed in all areas of life, including housing, health facilities, and public spaces. He urges lawmakers to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination and encourages everyone to push forward for full dignity and equality for all.
