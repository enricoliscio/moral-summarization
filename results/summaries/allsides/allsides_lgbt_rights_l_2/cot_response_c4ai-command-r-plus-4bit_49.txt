SUMMARY:
Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the anxiety surrounding the Supreme Court's impending ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. Despite the victory in the marriage equality fight, LGBTQ+ individuals still face threats of discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, housing, and public spaces. Obergefell emphasizes the need for explicit and comprehensive nondiscrimination protections to ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity, respect, and fairness. He calls for a win in the current Supreme Court cases and encourages lawmakers to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, with a current bill proposed in his home state of Ohio offering hope. Obergefell advocates for continued activism, education, and storytelling to push for equal rights and protect LGBTQ+ individuals from harm. The fight for equality continues to ensure that everyone can thrive and be included in "We the people."
