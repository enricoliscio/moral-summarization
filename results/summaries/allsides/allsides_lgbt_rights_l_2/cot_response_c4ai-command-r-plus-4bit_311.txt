SUMMARY:
As the Supreme Court prepares to rule on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals, Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the anxiety and importance of the moment. Obergefell highlights the ongoing threat of discrimination despite the freedom to marry victory. He shares stories of LGBTQ+ individuals facing harm due to a lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their states. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including employment, housing, and public spaces, to ensure dignity, respect, and fairness for everyone. While awaiting the Court's ruling, he also underscores the importance of community organizing, educating lawmakers, and sharing stories to build momentum for equal rights and protection from discrimination. The ultimate goal is to create a future where everyone is included in "We the people" and can thrive, free from unfair treatment and discrimination.
