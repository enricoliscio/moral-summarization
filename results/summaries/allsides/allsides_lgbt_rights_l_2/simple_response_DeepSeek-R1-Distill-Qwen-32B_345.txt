Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author, Jim Obergefell, is reflecting on his experience with the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage and now is anxious about upcoming cases on employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. He mentions the fear many still have despite the marriage victory because of the lack of explicit protections. 

I should highlight his journey from the past victory to the current challenges. He talks about the discrimination cases before the Supreme Court and the importance of a favorable ruling, which would align with public opinion. But he also emphasizes that even a win isn't the end; more comprehensive laws are needed, especially in states like Ohio where protections are lacking. 

He mentions a recent bill in Ohio with bipartisan support, showing hope but also the ongoing need for advocacy. The moral message is about equality, dignity, and the collective effort required to achieve full rights for LGBTQ+ people. I need to capture his optimism and the call to action for lawmakers and the community.

I'll structure the summary to first mention his past experience, then the current cases, the lack of protections, the importance of the Supreme Court ruling, the need for broader laws, and the ongoing efforts in states like Ohio. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral emphasis on justice and equality.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on his anxiety as he awaits a Supreme Court ruling on three cases involving LGBTQ+ employment discrimination. He recalls the relief he felt after the marriage equality victory but notes that discrimination remains a threat, with many LGBTQ+ individuals facing workplace bias, harassment, and firing due to their identity. Obergefell emphasizes the importance of a favorable Supreme Court ruling to protect LGBTQ+ people from employment discrimination, as 70% of Americans support such protections. However, he stresses that even a landmark victory would not solve all issues, as comprehensive nondiscrimination laws are needed in areas like housing, health care, and public spaces. Obergefell, who recently returned to Ohio, highlights the state's lack of protections and the opportunity for lawmakers to pass a bipartisan nondiscrimination bill. He calls for continued advocacy, education, and storytelling to ensure LGBTQ+ individuals are treated with dignity and equality. The fight for full rights and protections is ongoing, but Obergefell remains hopeful that collective efforts can secure justice for all. END OF SUMMARY.
