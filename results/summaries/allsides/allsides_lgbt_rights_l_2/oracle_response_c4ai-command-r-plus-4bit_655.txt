SUMMARY: As the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, which granted same-sex couples the freedom to marry nationwide, Jim Obergefell reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ equality and the impending Supreme Court ruling in three employment discrimination cases. Despite the victory in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination and lack of protection in areas such as housing, employment, and public accommodations. Obergefell shares personal stories of LGBTQ+ people who have endured discrimination, highlighting the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination protections. With bipartisan support for a nondiscrimination bill in his home state of Ohio, Obergefell emphasizes the importance of activism, advocacy, and education to ensure that all LGBTQ+ individuals are treated with dignity, equality, and protected from harm. The outcome of the Supreme Court cases is anxiously awaited as a potential win for the LGBTQ+ community and a step towards ensuring everyone is part of "We the people."
