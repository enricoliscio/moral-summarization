He highlights the ongoing threat of discrimination despite the victory in the marriage equality case, sharing stories of LGBTQ+ people facing employment discrimination and the lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states. Obergefell emphasizes the importance of ensuring dignity, respect, fairness, and equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. He advocates for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including employment, housing, health facilities, and public spaces. While awaiting the Court's decision, he also underscores the need to continue pushing for legislative change at the state level and engaging in grassroots efforts to educate lawmakers and foster community support.
