SUMMARY:
As the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, I anxiously await the Supreme Court's ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. A win would be a major victory, upholding the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, our work won't be over. We need to pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in every area of life, ensuring no one faces unfair treatment because of their LGBTQ+ identity. Everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of who they are. Lawmakers have another chance to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and it's up to all of us to push forward every day to ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination, no matter where they live. END OF SUMMARY.
