Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to focus on preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is by Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case which legalized same-sex marriage. He's talking about the current state of LGBTQ+ rights, particularly employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court.

First, I should identify the main points. He's anxious about the upcoming Supreme Court rulings on discrimination cases. He mentions that while same-sex marriage was a victory, there's still a lack of explicit protections in many states. He gives examples of discrimination in jobs, like people being fired for being LGBTQ+. He also talks about the importance of the Supreme Court ruling correctly and the need for comprehensive laws beyond just employment, like housing and public spaces.

He mentions moving back to Ohio, where there's no comprehensive protection, and a recent bill with bipartisan support. He emphasizes the ongoing fight for equality, encouraging people to push for change through various means, including legislation and community efforts.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect—justice, equality, dignity. It should highlight the progress made but also the work that's still needed. I should mention the cases, the lack of protections, the importance of the Supreme Court ruling, and the call to action for lawmakers and the community.

I should structure it to flow from the past victory to current challenges, the importance of the Supreme Court case, the need for more laws, and the ongoing efforts required. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's concise but covers all key points.

Let me start drafting: Jim Obergefell reflects on past victories in LGBTQ+ rights, now anxious as the Supreme Court considers discrimination cases. Despite marriage equality, many states lack protections. He shares stories of discrimination, emphasizing the need for legal protections. A favorable ruling would help, but more comprehensive laws are needed. He calls for continued activism, including supporting legislation, to ensure everyone's dignity.

Wait, that's too short. Maybe add more about the current cases and the Ohio situation. Also, mention the bipartisan bill in Ohio. Ensure the moral framing is clear—justice, dignity, equality.

Finalizing: Jim Obergefell, a key figure in the fight for same-sex marriage, expresses anxiety as the Supreme Court considers LGBTQ+ discrimination cases. While marriage equality was a milestone, many still face discrimination without legal protections. Obergefell highlights the need for the court to rule in favor of equality and for comprehensive laws beyond employment. He urges continued activism, including supporting bipartisan efforts in Ohio, to ensure everyone is treated with dignity.

That should cover the main points and the moral emphasis.
