Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to get the main points. The author is Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He's talking about his experience waiting for the Supreme Court ruling then and now, as he's waiting for another ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases.

He mentions that while same-sex marriage was a big win, many LGBTQ+ people still face discrimination in areas like employment, housing, and public spaces because there aren't explicit protections in many states. He's hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule in their favor, but he also emphasizes that even if they win, more work is needed to pass comprehensive laws protecting LGBTQ+ individuals everywhere.

He also talks about his home state, Ohio, where such protections aren't in place, and mentions a recent bipartisan bill proposed to address this. He encourages everyone to keep fighting for equality by supporting the court's decision, organizing in communities, and pushing lawmakers to pass necessary legislation.

So, the key points are: Obergefell's reflections on past and current Supreme Court cases, the ongoing need for LGBTQ+ protections beyond employment, the situation in Ohio, and the call to action for continued advocacy.

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start with Obergefell's background, mention the current cases, the lack of protections, the importance of the Supreme Court ruling, and the need for broader legislation. I'll also include his personal connection to Ohio and the proposed bill there.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on his anticipation for the Supreme Court's ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. While the marriage equality victory was a significant step, Obergefell highlights the ongoing lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states, leaving LGBTQ+ individuals vulnerable to discrimination in employment, housing, and public spaces. He emphasizes the importance of a favorable Supreme Court ruling to protect LGBTQ+ people but stresses that broader, comprehensive legislation is still needed. Obergefell, who recently returned to Ohio, a state without such protections, urges lawmakers to support a proposed bipartisan nondiscrimination bill. He calls for continued advocacy, including community organizing and educating lawmakers, to ensure all LGBTQ+ individuals thrive and are treated with dignity. END OF SUMMARY.
