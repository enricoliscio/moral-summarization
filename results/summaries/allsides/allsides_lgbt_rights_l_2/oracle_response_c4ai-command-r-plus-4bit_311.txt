SUMMARY: As the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, Jim Obergefell fought for the freedom to marry for same-sex couples and prevailed. Now, he reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ equality and the upcoming Supreme Court ruling in three employment discrimination cases. Despite the potential victory in these cases, there is still work to be done to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in all areas of life, including housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Obergefell highlights the lack of comprehensive nondiscrimination protections in a majority of states, including his home state of Ohio, and calls for lawmakers to pass clear and comprehensive protections. He emphasizes the importance of activism, advocacy, and sharing our stories to push for equality and ensure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. With momentum building, Obergefell believes that we can create a future where everyone is truly part of "We the people."
