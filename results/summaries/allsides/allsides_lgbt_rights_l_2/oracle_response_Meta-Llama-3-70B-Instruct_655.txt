SUMMARY: The author, Jim Obergefell, reflects on the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. He recalls the feeling of freedom and justice prevailing when same-sex couples won the right to marry nationwide. However, he notes that discrimination is still a threat, with many LGBTQ+ individuals facing harassment, rescinded job offers, and firing due to their identity. A win in these cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view that LGBTQ+ individuals should be legally protected from discrimination, a view supported by nearly 70% of Americans. The author emphasizes that even with a landmark victory, comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect. He urges lawmakers to pass clear protections and encourages activism, advocacy, and community organizing to push forward the fight for equal rights and dignity. END OF SUMMARY.
