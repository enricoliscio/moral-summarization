Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's by Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, which legalized same-sex marriage. He's reflecting on past achievements and current challenges regarding LGBTQ+ rights, particularly employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the text and pick out words that express values, ethics, or judgments. Words like "freedom," "justice," "anxiety," "discrimination," "dignity," "respect," "equality," "opportunity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "discrimination," "opportunity," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy," "victory," "rights," "equality," "dignity," "protection," "fairness," "morality," "activism," "advocacy,"
