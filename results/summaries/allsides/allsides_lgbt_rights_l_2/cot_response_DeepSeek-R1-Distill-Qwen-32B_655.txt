Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

Looking at the article, the author, Jim Obergefell, is discussing the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, specifically focusing on employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court. He mentions past victories like the legalization of same-sex marriage but points out that discrimination still exists. He emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws.

For the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "freedom," "justice," "anxiety," "discrimination," "prevailed," "supermajority," "burden," "fears," "explicit," "nondiscrimination," "protections," "rescinded," "transition," "harassment," "ignored," "victory," "assuage," "harm," "history," "protected," "equality," "dignity," "respect," "unfair," "expanded," "momentum," "protected," "thrive," "push," "organizing," "educating," "experiences," "stories," "dignity," "equality," "prohibit," "discrimination," "bipartisan," "momentum," "ensured," "future," "truly," "people."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Obergefell's past victory, his current anxiety about the new cases, the ongoing discrimination, and the need for comprehensive laws. I'll also touch on the legislative efforts in Ohio and the collective effort required to achieve equality.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the moral aspects, emphasizing justice, equality, discrimination, and the need for legal protections. I'll make sure to include key points like the Supreme Court cases, the lack of protections in many states, and the proposed legislation in Ohio with bipartisan support.

Finally, I'll conclude by mentioning the ongoing fight and the hope for a future where everyone is protected, using terms like "momentum," "push," and "equality." I'll make sure the summary captures the moral framing effectively while being concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the progress made for LGBTQ+ rights since the legalization of same-sex marriage but emphasizes that discrimination remains a threat. He highlights cases before the Supreme Court involving LGBTQ+ individuals fired due to their identity or relationships, stressing the need for explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell notes that while a favorable ruling would address some fears, comprehensive protections in areas like housing and public spaces are still needed. He calls for lawmakers to pass legislation, such as a recently proposed bipartisan bill in Ohio, to ensure dignity and equality for all. The fight for equality requires collective action, including advocating for the Supreme Court, organizing communities, and sharing stories to push for a future where everyone is truly protected and respected.
