Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, is reflecting on past victories and current anxieties about LGBTQ+ rights. He's concerned about employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court and the lack of comprehensive protections in many states, including his home state of Ohio.

I should highlight the key moral concepts: freedom, justice, discrimination, protection, dignity, equality. I'll mention the past victory in marriage equality, the current cases about employment discrimination, and the need for broader legal protections. Also, Obergefell's activism and the ongoing fight for equality should be included.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points. I'll start with the anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling, then touch on the lack of protections, the impact on individuals, and the call to action for lawmakers and the community. I'll make sure to use words like "freedom," "prevailed," "discrimination," "protected," "dignity," and "equality" to maintain the moral tone.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting from past achievements, current challenges, and the ongoing fight for equality. I'll end with a hopeful note about ensuring everyone is protected and part of "We the people."

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the moral and legal fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He recalls the freedom and justice brought by the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage but now anxiously awaits a Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases. Discrimination remains a threat, with LGBTQ+ individuals facing firing, harassment, and lack of protections in many states. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws to ensure dignity and equality for all. Despite potential victories, the fight is far from over, as protections must extend to housing, health, and public spaces. Lawmakers in states like Ohio have the opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation, but progress remains slow. Obergefell calls for continued activism, advocacy, and community organizing to push for equality and ensure everyone can thrive. The moral imperative is clear: uphold justice, protect the vulnerable, and expand dignity for all. END OF SUMMARY.
