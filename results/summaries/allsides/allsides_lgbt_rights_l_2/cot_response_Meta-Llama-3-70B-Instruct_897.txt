SUMMARY:
Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, anxiously awaits a new ruling from the Supreme Court. This time, it's about employment discrimination cases brought by LGBTQ+ people who were fired because of who they are or whom they love. Despite the marriage equality victory, discrimination remains a threat, and many same-sex couples fear lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their home states. A win in these cases would uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, the fight for equal rights goes on. Lawmakers must pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in every area of life, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of their LGBTQ+ identity. END OF SUMMARY.
