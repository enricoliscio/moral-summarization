SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, anxiously awaits a Supreme Court ruling on three cases involving LGBTQ+ people who were fired from their jobs due to their identity. Despite the freedom to marry nationwide, discrimination remains a threat, and many same-sex couples fear lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their home states. A win in these employment cases would protect people from harm and uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, the fight for equal rights goes on. Obergefell urges lawmakers to pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in every area of life, ensuring no one faces unfair treatment because of their LGBTQ+ identity. It's up to all of us to push forward every day, educating lawmakers, sharing our stories, and organizing in our communities to ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination and treated with dignity and respect.
