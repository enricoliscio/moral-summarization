SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Despite the victory in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, housing, and public accommodations. Obergefell highlights the upcoming Supreme Court ruling in three cases regarding LGBTQ+ employment discrimination, expressing hope for a decision that upholds protections for the community. He emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws, citing his own experiences in Ohio, a state lacking such protections. Obergefell calls for continued activism and education to ensure full equality and dignity for LGBTQ+ individuals across the nation. He concludes by expressing optimism for a future where everyone is included in "We the people."
