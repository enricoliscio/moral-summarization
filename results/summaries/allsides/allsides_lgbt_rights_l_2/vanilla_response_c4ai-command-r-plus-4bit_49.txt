SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Despite the victory in marriage equality, discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals remains a pressing issue, with many states lacking explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell shares stories of LGBTQ+ people facing discrimination in employment, highlighting the need for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including housing, health, and public spaces. He emphasizes the high public support for LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination laws and the responsibility of lawmakers to enact them. With a pending Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases and a proposed nondiscrimination bill in his home state of Ohio, Obergefell stresses the importance of continued advocacy and storytelling to achieve full equality and dignity for LGBTQ+ individuals. He remains hopeful for a future where everyone is included in "We the people."
