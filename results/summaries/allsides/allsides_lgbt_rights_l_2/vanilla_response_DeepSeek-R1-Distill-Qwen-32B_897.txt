Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The author is Jim Obergefell, who was the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He's reflecting on the current state of LGBTQ+ rights, particularly focusing on employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court.

He mentions feeling anxious, similar to when he was waiting for the marriage equality ruling. He talks about the progress made but also the ongoing issues, like lack of nondiscrimination protections in many states. Examples include people being fired or facing harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Obergefell emphasizes that while a favorable Supreme Court ruling would help, it's not the end of the fight. He points out that comprehensive protections are needed in areas like housing, health, and public spaces. He also mentions his home state, Ohio, which lacks these protections and how lawmakers have the chance to pass a nondiscrimination bill with bipartisan support.

He ends by calling for continued advocacy, including community organizing and educating lawmakers, to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and equality.

So, the summary needs to capture these key points: the author's background, the current Supreme Court cases, the need for broader protections, the situation in Ohio, and the call to action for ongoing advocacy. I'll make sure to keep it concise, within 200 words, and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights. While the marriage equality victory was a significant step, Obergefell notes that discrimination remains a threat, particularly in employment. The Supreme Court is currently considering cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals who were fired due to their identity or relationships. A favorable ruling would provide crucial protections, but Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive nondiscrimination laws covering housing, health, and public spaces. He highlights the lack of such protections in his home state of Ohio, where lawmakers recently proposed a bipartisan nondiscrimination bill. Obergefell calls for continued advocacy, urging the Supreme Court, lawmakers, and communities to ensure LGBTQ+ individuals are treated with dignity and equality. The fight for full rights and protections is far from over, but momentum is building for a future where all are included in "We the people." END OF SUMMARY.
