SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, anxiously awaits a new Supreme Court ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the freedom to marry, discrimination remains a threat, and many same-sex couples still fear for their livelihoods due to lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their home states. Obergefell recalls hearing stories of gay, transgender, and bisexual individuals who faced harassment, had job offers rescinded, or were fired because of who they are or whom they love. A win in these cases would uphold the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, the fight for equal rights is far from over. Lawmakers must pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in all areas of life, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Momentum is building, and together, we can ensure that everyone is protected from discrimination, no matter where they live. END OF SUMMARY.
