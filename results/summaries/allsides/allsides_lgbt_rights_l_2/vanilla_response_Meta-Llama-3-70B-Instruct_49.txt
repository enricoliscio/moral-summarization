SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, reflects on the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ equality. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, discrimination remains a threat, particularly in employment. Obergefell anxiously awaits the Court's ruling in three cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals who were fired due to their identity or whom they love. A win would alleviate fears and protect people from harm, but comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Obergefell notes that nearly 70% of Americans support legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. He urges lawmakers to pass clear and comprehensive protections, citing his home state of Ohio as an example of where such legislation is needed. The fight for equal rights continues, and Obergefell encourages organizing, educating, and sharing stories to ensure full dignity and equality for all.
