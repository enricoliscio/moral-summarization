SUMMARY:
Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case Obergefell v. Hodges, reflects on the anxiety and anticipation surrounding two pivotal moments in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. The first was the Supreme Court ruling that granted same-sex couples the freedom to marry nationwide, a decision that brought justice and was supported by a supermajority of Americans. Now, Obergefell anxiously awaits the Court's ruling on employment discrimination cases brought by LGBTQ+ individuals who faced harm and unfair treatment because of who they are or whom they love. A victory in these cases would provide vital protection and uphold the moral right of LGBTQ+ individuals to be free from discrimination, a view held by nearly 70% of Americans. However, even with a favorable ruling, the fight for equality is not over. Obergefell emphasizes the need for comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including housing, health, and public spaces, to ensure LGBTQ+ individuals are treated with dignity and respect. He highlights the ongoing struggle in his home state of Ohio, where lawmakers have repeatedly failed to pass nondiscrimination legislation. With a recent bipartisan bill introduced, there is hope for change, but it is clear that the fight for equal rights and against unfair treatment and discrimination must continue through community organizing, education, and storytelling. Obergefell calls on all to join this moral fight so that everyone can be part of "We the people," free from discrimination and treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
