SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, discrimination still persists, and many LGBTQ+ individuals face harassment and unfair treatment in the workplace, housing, and public spaces. Obergefell anxiously awaits the Supreme Court's ruling on three cases involving LGBTQ+ people who were fired from their jobs due to their identity or whom they love. A win would be a significant step forward, but it's only the beginning. Comprehensive protections are still needed in every area of life, and lawmakers must take action to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Obergefell urges everyone to push forward, educate lawmakers, and share their stories to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their LGBTQ+ identity.
