SUMMARY: In 2015, Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, fought for the freedom to marry for same-sex couples across the nation. Now, Obergefell reflects on the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ equality and the recent Supreme Court hearing on employment discrimination cases. Despite the victory in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ individuals still face the threat of discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, housing, and public spaces. Obergefell highlights the stories of LGBTQ+ people who have faced discrimination, such as job offer rescission, firing due to gender transition, and enduring harassment without employer intervention. A win in the Supreme Court cases would protect LGBTQ+ individuals from harm and uphold their dignity. However, further work is needed to pass comprehensive nondiscrimination protections in states like Ohio, where Obergefell resides. Lawmakers have the opportunity to support and expand equal rights by prohibiting discrimination and ensuring dignity and equality for all. Obergefell emphasizes the importance of activism, advocacy, and sharing stories to push for change and create a future where everyone is truly included in "We the people."
