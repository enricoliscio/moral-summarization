SUMMARY:
As the named plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, I anxiously await the Supreme Court's ruling on three cases involving LGBTQ+ people who were fired from their jobs due to who they are or whom they love. This discrimination is a threat to the freedom and dignity of same-sex couples, who still lack explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states. A win in these employment cases would be a step towards upholding the view that nearly 70% of Americans hold: LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination. However, even with a landmark victory, our work won't be over. We need to pass clear and comprehensive protections for LGBTQ+ people in every area of life, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of who they are. Lawmakers have another chance to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and it's up to us to push forward every day for equal rights and a future where everyone is truly part of "We the people."
END OF SUMMARY.
