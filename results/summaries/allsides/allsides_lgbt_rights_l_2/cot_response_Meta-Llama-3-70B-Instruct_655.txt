SUMMARY:
Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the landmark civil rights decision Obergefell v. Hodges, anxiously awaits the Supreme Court's ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the freedom to marry nationwide, discrimination remains a threat, and many same-sex couples still fear for their livelihoods due to lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in their home states. A win in these cases would uphold the view that LGBTQ+ people should be legally protected from discrimination, which nearly 70% of Americans hold. However, even with a landmark victory, comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Lawmakers have another chance to pass legislation prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination, and it's up to all of us to push forward every day to ensure equal rights and full dignity for all.
