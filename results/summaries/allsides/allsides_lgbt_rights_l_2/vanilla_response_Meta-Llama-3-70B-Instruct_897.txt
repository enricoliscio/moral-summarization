SUMMARY:

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, reflects on the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ equality. Despite the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in his favor, many LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in their daily lives, particularly in states without explicit nondiscrimination protections. Obergefell anxiously awaits the Supreme Court's ruling in three employment discrimination cases, hoping for a victory that would protect LGBTQ+ people from harm and uphold the view held by nearly 70% of Americans. However, he emphasizes that even with a win, comprehensive protections are still needed in areas like housing, health facilities, and public spaces. Obergefell urges lawmakers to pass nondiscrimination legislation, citing his home state of Ohio as an example of a state that has failed to do so. He encourages continued activism and community organizing to ensure full dignity and equality for all LGBTQ+ individuals.
