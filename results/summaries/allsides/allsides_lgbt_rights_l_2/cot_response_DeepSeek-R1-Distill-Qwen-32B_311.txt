Okay, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the given news article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings. 

First, I need to understand the article. It's by Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case, which legalized same-sex marriage. He's talking about his experiences and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights, especially regarding employment discrimination cases before the Supreme Court. He also mentions the need for comprehensive protections beyond employment and the legislative efforts in Ohio.

Now, for STEP 1, I have to find all the single words that carry moral framing. These are words that convey values, ethics, or principles. Let me go through the article sentence by sentence.

- "freedom to marry" → freedom
- "justice had prevailed" → justice
- "anxiety" → anxiety
- "discrimination" → discrimination
- "threat" → threat
- "explicit nondiscrimination protections" → nondiscrimination
- "rescinded" → rescinded
- "fired" → fired
- "anti-LGBTQ harassment" → harassment
- "protected" → protected
- "dignity and respect" → dignity, respect
- "unfair treatment" → unfair
- "passionate" → passionate
- "fail to pass legislation" → fail
- "prohibit" → prohibit
- "dignity and equality" → dignity, equality
- "push forward" → push
- "organizing" → organizing
- "educating" → educating
- "sharing" → sharing
- "thrive" → thrive
- "momentum" → momentum
- "protected" → protected
- "truly part of 'We the people.'" → part, people

Wait, some of these might not be single words in the context. For example, "nondiscrimination" is a compound word but counts as one. I need to list each as per their occurrence.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping the moral words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by mentioning Obergefell's role in the marriage equality case, his current anxiety about the discrimination cases, the lack of protections in many states, the impact on LGBTQ+ individuals, the importance of the Supreme Court ruling, the need for comprehensive laws, and the legislative efforts in Ohio. I'll conclude with the hope for a future where everyone is protected.

I should make sure to include words like freedom, justice, discrimination, dignity, respect, unfair, protected, equality, etc., to preserve the moral framing. Let me structure this to flow naturally, ensuring each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  

Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges case, reflects on the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. He recalls the historic victory for marriage equality and now anxiously awaits the Supreme Court's ruling on cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals fired due to discrimination. Despite progress, many states lack explicit nondiscrimination protections, leaving LGBTQ+ people vulnerable to unfair treatment in employment, housing, and public spaces. Obergefell emphasizes the importance of the Supreme Court upholding LGBTQ+ rights and urges lawmakers to pass comprehensive protections. He highlights Ohio's failure to enact such legislation but notes a recent bipartisan effort to propose a nondiscrimination bill. Obergefell calls for continued advocacy, education, and storytelling to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity. The fight for equality is ongoing, and together, society can build momentum toward a future where all are truly protected and included.
