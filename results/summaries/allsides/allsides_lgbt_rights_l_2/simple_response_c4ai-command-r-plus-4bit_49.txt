SUMMARY: I was the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide over four years ago, and now I'm anxiously awaiting the Court's ruling on LGBTQ+ employment discrimination cases. While a win would be a huge step forward, it's not enough. LGBTQ+ people still lack comprehensive nondiscrimination protections in areas like housing, health, and public spaces, and it's up to all of us to continue the fight for equality. Lawmakers in my home state of Ohio, for example, have failed to pass nondiscrimination legislation, but there is a new bill with bipartisan support. We must continue to push for equality in our communities, educate lawmakers, and share our stories until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Our work won't be done until everyone is protected from discrimination and can truly be part of "We the people."
END OF SUMMARY.
