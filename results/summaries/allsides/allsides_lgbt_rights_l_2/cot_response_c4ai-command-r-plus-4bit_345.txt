SUMMARY:
Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark civil rights case Obergefell v. Hodges, reflects on the anxiety surrounding the Supreme Court's impending ruling on employment discrimination cases involving LGBTQ+ individuals. Obergefell emphasizes the ongoing threat of discrimination despite the victory in the marriage equality case. He shares stories of LGBTQ+ individuals facing harm due to a lack of explicit nondiscrimination protections in many states. Obergefell advocates for clear and comprehensive protections in all areas of life, including employment, housing, health, and public spaces. He highlights the moral imperative of ensuring dignity, respect, and freedom from unfair treatment for LGBTQ+ individuals, a view supported by nearly 70% of Americans. The fight for equal rights continues with legislative efforts, community organizing, and sharing stories to foster moral understanding and ensure everyone is protected from discrimination and able to thrive. Obergefell encourages the Supreme Court to uphold justice and calls on all of us to push for a future where LGBTQ+ individuals are truly part of "We the people."
