Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama meeting with LGBT activists in Russia. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Russia passing laws against promoting gay relationships to minors, which has led to increased violence against the LGBT community. Human rights groups are criticizing Russia, and there's been a call to boycott the Sochi Olympics. President Obama is meeting with LGBT rights groups during the G-20 summit, which is seen as a stand against Russia's policies. He previously didn't support the boycott but criticized the laws. The meeting was arranged after he canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes, like Snowden and Syria. Human Rights First supports this move, emphasizing solidarity with the activists.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Russia's laws, the violence against LGBT people, Obama's meeting as a moral stance, his criticism of the laws, the context of other disputes leading to the canceled meeting with Putin, and the support from Human Rights First.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral aspect, showing Obama's support for human rights and equality. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each important point is covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is meeting with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, signaling support for human rights amid international criticism of Russia's anti-LGBT laws. Russia has faced condemnation for legislation banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries recognizing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups report increased violence against LGBT individuals since the laws were enacted. While Obama opposes the laws, he has not supported boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists, arranged after canceling a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and Syria, highlights the U.S. solidarity with Russia's civil society and LGBT community. Human Rights First praised the move, urging Obama to also publicly condemn Russia's human rights abuses. Putin defended Russia's treatment of LGBT individuals, claiming normal relations with them.
