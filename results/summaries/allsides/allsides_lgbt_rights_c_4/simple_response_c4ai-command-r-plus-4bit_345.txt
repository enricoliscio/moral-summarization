SUMMARY: President Obama took a stand against Russia's oppressive laws and human rights violations by meeting with LGBT rights activists during his visit to the country for the G-20 summit. Russia has faced international criticism and outrage due to their laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and prohibiting adoptions by countries that support same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community in Russia. Obama's decision to meet with activists sends a powerful message of solidarity and support for LGBT equality and human rights. Despite canceling a meeting with President Putin due to several disputes, Obama made it clear that he strongly opposes Russia's anti-gay legislation and stands firmly on the side of human rights. Putin, however, claims to have "absolutely normal relations" with the LGBT community and denies any wrongdoing. Human rights organizations have praised Obama's actions and encouraged him to continue speaking out against Russia's abuses.

END OF SUMMARY.
