Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words from the original text. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit. Russia has passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism, including calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics. Obama doesn't support the boycott but criticizes the laws. He's meeting with activists, which shows solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. The meeting was arranged after canceling a meeting with Putin due to disputes, including Snowden and Syria. Putin defended the laws, saying they're normal.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible: violence, passed, bans, laws, legislation, penalize, blocking, decision, stands, targeted, crackdown, abuses.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the meeting, the laws passed, the resulting violence, international criticism, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting with Putin, and Putin's response. I need to ensure that the moral words are included naturally.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Obama meeting activists, mention the laws passed, the bans, increased violence, international criticism, the boycott calls, Obama's position on the boycott, his criticism, the canceled meeting with Putin, and Putin's defense. Make sure to use the moral terms appropriately.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Also, the summary should end with the specified tokens. Let me put it all together, ensuring all key points and moral framing words are included.

SUMMARY: President Obama is meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, following criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against Russia's LGBT community and international condemnation. While Obama opposes the laws, he does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists, which also includes representatives from human rights, free media, and environmental groups, signals U.S. solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. This decision comes after Obama canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its blocking of U.N. action on Syria. Putin has defended Russia's laws, claiming normal relations with LGBT individuals. The meeting highlights Obama's stance against human rights abuses and support for LGBT equality. END OF SUMMARY.
