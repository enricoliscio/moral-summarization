SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws that ban the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since these laws were passed. President Obama has expressed strong criticism of these laws, but he does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as he does not want to penalize American athletes. Instead, he will use his visit to stand in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's LGBT crackdown and human rights abuses. This meeting is particularly notable as it follows the cancellation of a meeting between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and their blocking of UN action against Syria. Human rights advocates have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists, urging him to speak out against Russia's abuses and to reaffirm America's commitment to LGBT equality and human rights. Putin, however, has downplayed the international criticism, claiming to have "absolutely normal relations" with LGBT individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
