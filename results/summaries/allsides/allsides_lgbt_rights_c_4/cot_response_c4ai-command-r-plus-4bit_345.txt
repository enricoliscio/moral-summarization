SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amid international criticism of Russia's recent laws discriminating against the LGBT community, including a law banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against LGBT Russians since the laws passed. Obama has expressed sharp criticism of these laws, stating that he is "offended" by Russia's anti-gay legislation. The meeting with activists is a clear signal of solidarity with those facing discrimination and a stand for LGBT equality and human rights. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has downplayed the international scorn, claiming "normal relations" with the LGBT community. END OF SUMMARY.
