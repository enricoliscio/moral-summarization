Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of them as possible without forcing them.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Obama meeting with Russian activists, including LGBT groups, during the G-20 summit. Russia has passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism.

I should highlight the moral issues: the laws passed by Russia, the violence against the community, the bans, and the international response. Also, mention Obama's criticism and his meeting with activists despite the canceled meeting with Putin.

I'll structure the summary to include key events and the moral implications. Make sure to use the specified words like "violence," "passed," "bans," "laws," "legislation," "penalize," "blocking," "decision," "stands," "targeted," "crackdown," "abuses."

I'll start by stating Obama's meeting, then the context of Russia's laws, the resulting violence, international criticism, and Obama's stance. I'll also note the canceled meeting with Putin and the praise from Human Rights First.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft a few sentences, ensuring the moral framing words are included naturally.

Finally, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and the summary flows well while preserving the moral tone.

SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with Russian civil society groups, including LGBT rights activists, during the G-20 summit, despite canceling a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This decision comes amid international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages, which have led to increased violence against the LGBT community. Human rights groups have condemned these laws as part of a broader crackdown on civil liberties. Obama has criticized the legislation, calling it offensive, while also opposing a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists is seen as a symbolic stand against Russia's human rights abuses and a reaffirmation of U.S. support for LGBT equality. END OF SUMMARY.
