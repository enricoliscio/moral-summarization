SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This meeting comes amid international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported increased violence against Russia's LGBT community following these laws. The laws have also led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, although Obama has stated he does not support such a boycott. Obama's meeting with LGBT activists is intended to show solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown on LGBT rights and civil society. This meeting follows Obama's cancellation of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and the Syrian conflict. Human rights groups have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists. Putin has defended Russia's record on LGBT rights, stating that he has "absolutely normal relations" with LGBT individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
