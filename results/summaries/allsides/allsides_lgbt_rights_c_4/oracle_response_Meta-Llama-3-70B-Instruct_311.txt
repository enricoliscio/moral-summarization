SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amidst international criticism of the country's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of the legislation, calling it "anti-gay and lesbian" and stating that nobody is more offended than him. The meeting is seen as a signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Obama's decision to meet with activists comes after he canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a string of disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of action against Syria. Putin has downplayed the international criticism, claiming that he has "absolutely normal relations" with the LGBT community.
