SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amidst international criticism of the country's laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and increased violence against LGBT individuals. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by the anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting is seen as a signal that the United States stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Obama's decision to meet with activists comes after canceling a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, following disputes over Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of action against Syria. Putin has downplayed the international criticism, claiming that he works with LGBT individuals and awards them state prizes.
