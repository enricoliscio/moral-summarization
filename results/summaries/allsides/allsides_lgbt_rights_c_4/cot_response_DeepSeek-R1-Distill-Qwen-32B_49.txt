Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article, but with a focus on preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the user provided a news article about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit. They also mentioned that Russia has passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. There's criticism from human rights groups and an increase in violence against the LGBT community. Obama didn't support boycotting the Olympics but criticized the laws. There's also mention of a canceled meeting with Putin and Putin's response.

The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. So, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "criticized," "banning," "violence," "rights," "boycott," "offended," "solidarity," "abuses," "equality," "condemned," "oppression," "freedom," "discrimination," "discourse," and "morality" come to mind. These words are used to convey judgment or evaluation, so they fit the moral framing.

Next, the user wants a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: Obama meeting with activists, Russia's laws, international criticism, violence against LGBT community, Obama's stance on the Olympics, the canceled meeting with Putin, and the moral implications of the situation.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the banning of gay promotion, the violence, the human rights abuses, and the solidarity with the activists. I also need to mention Obama's criticism and the broader implications for human rights and equality.

I have to be careful to keep the summary within the word limit, so I'll need to be concise but include the key morally charged words. Let me make sure each point is covered without going into too much detail. The summary should flow logically, starting with Obama's meeting, then the context of Russia's laws, the criticism and violence, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting, and the moral support for human rights.

I think I've got all the elements. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include the identified morally framed words and keep it under 200 words.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama will meet with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, signaling U.S. solidarity with those targeted by Russia's restrictive laws. Russia has faced international condemnation for banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and for blocking adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups report increased violence against LGBT individuals since the laws were enacted. While Obama opposes boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, he has strongly criticized Russia's anti-LGBT legislation. The meeting follows Obama's cancellation of a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to tensions, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its opposition to UN Security Council action on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's decision to meet with civil society, urging him to also condemn Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm support for LGBT equality. Putin defended Russia's treatment of its LGBT community, claiming normal relations with its citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
