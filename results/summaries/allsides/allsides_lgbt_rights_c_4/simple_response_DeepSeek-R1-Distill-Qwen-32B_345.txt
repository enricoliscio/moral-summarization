Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Russia passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism. The US is considering boycotting the Sochi Olympics, but Obama doesn't support that. Instead, he's meeting with activists to show support. The meeting was scheduled after cancelling a meeting with Putin due to other disputes.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: the laws, the criticism, the meeting, the context of the G-20, and the moral stance against the Russian laws. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral framing, which emphasizes support for human rights and equality.

I'll start by stating Obama's meeting, mention the laws and their impact, note the criticism, his stance on the Olympics, and the significance of the meeting. I'll end with the moral message against the laws.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's concise. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Alright, I think I have a good structure for the summary.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, signaling U.S. solidarity with those targeted by Russia's restrictive laws. Russia has faced international criticism for banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community. While Obama opposes boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, he has condemned the Russian laws, calling them deeply offensive. The meeting with activists highlights the U.S. commitment to human rights and equality, despite tensions with Russia over issues like Edward Snowden and Syria. Human rights groups applaud the move, urging Obama to also publicly oppose Russia's human rights abuses. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin claims normal relations with the LGBT community, dismissing international concerns.  
END OF SUMMARY.
