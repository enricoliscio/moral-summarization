SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amid international criticism of Russia's recent laws: one banning the *promotion* of gay relationships to minors and another prohibiting adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in *violence* against Russia's LGBT community following these laws. President Obama has expressed sharp *criticism* of these laws, stating that he is "*offended*" by Russia's *anti-gay legislation*. Human rights activists have applauded Obama's decision to meet with them, urging him to also speak out against Russia's human rights *abuses* and to reaffirm America's commitment to LGBT *equality* and human rights. This meeting underscores the moral stance against Russia's *crackdown* on LGBT rights and free expression.
