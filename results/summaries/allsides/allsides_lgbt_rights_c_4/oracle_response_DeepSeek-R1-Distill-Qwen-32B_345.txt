Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user has specified certain words to include, so I should make sure to incorporate those. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit. Russia has passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community. There's also criticism from human rights groups and a call for a boycott of the Winter Olympics. Obama canceled a meeting with Putin due to disagreements, including Snowden's asylum and blocking UN action on Syria.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning Obama meeting the activists, the laws passed by Russia, the resulting violence, and the international criticism. I should include words like "violence," "passed," "bans," "legislation," "penalize," "blocking," "decision," "targeted," "crackdown," "abuses." 

I'll structure it to highlight the moral issues: Russia's laws leading to violence and targeting, Obama's support for human rights, and the broader context of disputes with Putin. I'll keep it under 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered without losing the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary moral terms and convey the support for human rights and opposition to Russia's actions.

SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, following international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against Russia's LGBT community and calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. While Obama opposes the laws, he has not supported a boycott, prioritizing American athletes. The meeting with activists, which includes representatives from human rights, environmental, and free media groups, signals U.S. solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. This comes after Obama canceled a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN Security Council action on Syria. Human rights groups applaud Obama's decision, urging him to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm support for LGBT equality. Putin has defended Russia's relations with its LGBT community, claiming they are "normal." END OF SUMMARY.
