SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws that ban the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since the laws were passed. The legislation has led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, although Obama has stated that he does not support such a boycott to penalize American athletes. Obama canceled a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the G-20 summit due to several disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN Security Council action against Syria. Human rights organizations have praised Obama's decision to meet with activists, urging him to speak out against Russia's LGBT crackdown and human rights abuses. Putin has defended his government's actions, claiming normal relations with LGBT individuals. The meeting with activists will include representatives from groups supporting human rights, the environment, free media, and LGBT rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
