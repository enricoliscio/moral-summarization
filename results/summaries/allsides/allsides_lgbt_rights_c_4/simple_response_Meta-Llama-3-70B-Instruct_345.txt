SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This meeting is a strong moral statement against Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and banning adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT individuals in Russia since these laws were passed. Obama has been critical of these laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than he is by such anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting is a clear signal that the United States stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin has downplayed the international criticism, claiming that he has "absolutely normal relations" with LGBT individuals. Obama's meeting with LGBT rights activists is a powerful moral stance in support of human rights and equality.
