Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that President Obama is meeting with Swedish Prime Minister and then talks about Russia's laws against promoting gay relationships to minors. Human rights groups are reporting more violence against the LGBT community in Russia. Obama's meeting will include groups supporting LGBT rights, free media, and the environment. 

It also mentions that this meeting is part of the G-20 summit in Russia. The White House official says the meeting will happen on Friday, and they didn't want to be identified because the schedule isn't public yet. 

Russia passed a law in June banning promotion of gay relationships to minors, and another law against adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. These laws have caused international criticism and calls to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Obama didn't support the boycott but criticized the laws. 

Obama canceled a meeting with Putin before the G-20 because of disputes, like granting asylum to Edward Snowden and blocking UN action on Syria. Human Rights First supports Obama's decision to meet with activists, saying it shows solidarity with those affected by Russia's laws. 

Putin responded by saying he works normally with these groups and doesn't see any issues.

So, the main points are: Obama meeting with LGBT activists in Russia during G-20, Russia's laws causing international criticism and violence, Obama's criticism of the laws, cancellation of meeting with Putin due to other issues, and Putin's response.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key events and implications. I should mention the meeting, the laws, the criticism, the boycott calls, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting, and Putin's response. Make sure it's concise and covers all important aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, following international criticism of Russia's laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against Russia's LGBT community and calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. While Obama opposes the boycott, he has criticized the laws, calling them offensive. The meeting, which also includes representatives from human rights, environmental, and free media groups, comes after Obama canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's support for Edward Snowden and its stance on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's decision, urging him to continue speaking out against Russia's human rights abuses. Putin defended Russia's treatment of LGBT groups, stating they have normal relations. END OF SUMMARY.
