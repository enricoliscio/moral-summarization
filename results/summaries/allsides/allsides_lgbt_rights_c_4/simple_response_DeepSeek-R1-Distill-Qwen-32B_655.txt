Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups, including LGBT rights activists, during the G-20 summit in Russia. Russia has recently passed laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism, including calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics. Obama doesn't support the boycott but has criticized the laws. He also canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes.

I need to capture the moral issues here: the restrictive laws in Russia affecting the LGBT community, international response, Obama's stance, and the significance of his meeting with activists. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing about human rights and equality.

Let me structure the summary: start with Obama's meeting, mention the laws and their impact, international reaction, Obama's position on the Olympics, his criticism, the canceled meeting with Putin, and the symbolic importance of his meeting with activists.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the human rights violations and the US's support for equality. Avoid any technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is meeting with human rights, environmental, and LGBT rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, signaling support for those targeted by Russia's restrictive laws. Russia has faced international criticism for laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community. While Obama opposes the laws, he has not supported boycotting the Sochi Olympics, prioritizing American athletes. The meeting follows the cancellation of a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to tensions, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its stance on Syria. Activists applaud Obama's gesture, urging him to also publicly condemn Russia's human rights abuses. Putin has defended his government's treatment of LGBT individuals, claiming normal relations. The meeting underscores the moral imperative to address human rights and promote equality.
