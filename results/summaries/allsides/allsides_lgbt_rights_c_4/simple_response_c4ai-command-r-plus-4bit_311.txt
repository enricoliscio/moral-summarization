SUMMARY: President Obama takes a stand against Russia's anti-gay laws and meets with LGBT rights activists during his visit to the country for the G-20 summit. Russia has faced international criticism and scorn for passing laws that discriminate against the LGBT community, including a law banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and another law banning adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT Russians since these laws were passed. President Obama has expressed his strong opposition to these laws and will meet with LGBT rights activists, along with other human rights, environmental, and free media groups, to show his support and solidarity. This meeting comes after Obama canceled a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Russia's actions regarding Edward Snowden and the Syrian conflict. Human rights organizations applaud Obama's decision to meet with activists and urge him to continue to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses. Putin, meanwhile, claims to have "absolutely normal relations" with the LGBT community in Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
