Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author. Let me read through the article carefully to identify the key points and the moral terms.

First, the article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups, including LGBT rights activists, during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. Russia has been criticized for passing laws that ban promoting gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international condemnation, including calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics. Obama opposes the laws but doesn't support a boycott. The meeting with activists is seen as a stand against Russia's crackdown on civil society and human rights.

I need to make sure to include the moral words like "violence," "passed," "bans," "laws," "legislation," "penalize," "blocking," "decision," "stands," "targeted," "crackdown," and "abuses." I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the negative impact of the laws and the international response.

I'll start by mentioning Obama's meeting with activists, then the Russian laws and their consequences, the international criticism, Obama's stance, and the significance of the meeting. I'll ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral terms as possible.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence conveys the moral framing without being too verbose. I'll check that all key points are covered and that the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, signaling U.S. solidarity against Russia's crackdown on civil society and human rights. Russia has faced international condemnation for passing laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community. Human rights groups have called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi due to these laws, though Obama opposes a boycott, stating he doesn't want to penalize American athletes. The meeting comes after Obama canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN Security Council action on Syria. Critics applaud Obama's decision to stand with activists, urging him to also speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm support for LGBT equality. Putin has defended Russia's treatment of its citizens, claiming normal relations with those targeted by the laws. END OF SUMMARY.
