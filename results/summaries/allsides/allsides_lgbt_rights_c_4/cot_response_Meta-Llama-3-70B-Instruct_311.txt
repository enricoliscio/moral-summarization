SUMMARY:
During the G-20 summit in Russia, President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists to discuss the country's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT individuals since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of these laws, calling them "anti-gay and lesbian legislation" and stating that he is "offended" by them. The meeting comes after Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of action against Syria. Human Rights First applauded the decision, saying it sends a clear signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. END OF SUMMARY.
