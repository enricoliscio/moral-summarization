SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amidst international criticism of the country's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by same-sex couples. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against LGBT individuals since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian legislation, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by such laws. The meeting is seen as a signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Human Rights First has applauded the decision, urging Obama to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm the US's commitment to LGBT equality and human rights. Putin has responded to international criticism, claiming that he has "absolutely normal relations" with LGBT individuals and doesn't see anything out of the ordinary.

END OF SUMMARY.
