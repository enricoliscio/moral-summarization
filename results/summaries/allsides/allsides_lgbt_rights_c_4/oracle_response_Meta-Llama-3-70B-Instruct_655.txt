SUMMARY:

President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amidst international criticism of the country's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by same-sex marriage countries. Human rights groups report an uptick in violence against LGBT Russians since the laws passed, leading to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by the anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting is seen as a signal of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Obama's decision to meet with activists comes after canceling a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, following disputes over Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of action against Syria. Putin has downplayed the criticism, claiming normal relations with the LGBT community.
