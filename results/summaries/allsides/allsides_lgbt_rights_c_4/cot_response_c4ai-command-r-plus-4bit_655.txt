SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community following these laws. There have been calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, but Obama has stated his opposition to this idea, not wanting to penalize American athletes. However, he has expressed sharp criticism of Russia's anti-gay legislation, stating that he is "offended" by it. Obama's meeting with LGBT activists is a show of solidarity and support for human rights, equality, and against Russia's LGBT crackdown. Putin, on the other hand, claims to have "normal relations" with LGBT individuals in Russia and denies any extraordinary issues. This meeting is especially notable as it comes after Obama canceled a meeting with Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and the Syrian conflict. Human rights organizations applaud Obama's decision to meet with civil society, urging him to further speak out against Russia's human rights abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
