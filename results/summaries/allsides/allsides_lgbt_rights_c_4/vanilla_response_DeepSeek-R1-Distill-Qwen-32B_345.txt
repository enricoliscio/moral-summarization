Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups, including LGBT rights activists, during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. It mentions that Russia passed a law banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors, which has led to increased violence against the LGBT community there. Human rights groups are criticizing Russia, and there's been talk of boycotting the Sochi Winter Olympics because of these laws.

Obama doesn't support the boycott but has criticized the Russian laws. He's meeting with activists, which is a move supported by groups like Human Rights First. However, he canceled a meeting with Putin due to other issues, like Russia giving asylum to Edward Snowden and blocking UN action on Syria.

Putin defended his country's treatment of LGBT people, saying they have normal relations. The summary should include all these key points concisely.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the essence without going into too much detail. I'll structure it by mentioning Obama's meeting, the laws in Russia, the criticism, the boycott discussions, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting with Putin, and Putin's response.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. I should also ensure that each sentence flows logically to the next, covering all important aspects without redundancy.

SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, following criticism of Russia's laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against Russia's LGBT community and calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. While Obama opposes the boycott, he has criticized the Russian laws, calling them offensive. The meeting with activists comes after Obama canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN action on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's decision to meet with activists, emphasizing US solidarity with those targeted by Russia's policies. Putin defended Russia's treatment of LGBT individuals, stating they have normal relations. END OF SUMMARY.
