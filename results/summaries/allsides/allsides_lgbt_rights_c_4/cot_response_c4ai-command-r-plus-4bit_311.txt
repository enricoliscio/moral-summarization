SUMMARY: 
President Obama has decided to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community following these discriminatory laws. President Obama's meeting with activists sends a strong message of solidarity and support for LGBT equality and human rights. It also demonstrates his firm stance against Russia's anti-gay legislation and human rights abuses. Obama's decision to cancel a previous meeting with President Putin over disputes, including Russia's granting of asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN Security Council action on Syria, further emphasizes his commitment to these moral issues. Human rights organizations have applauded Obama's choice to stand with those targeted by Russia's LGBT crackdown. Putin, however, claims to have "normal relations" with these communities and denies any extraordinary circumstances. END OF SUMMARY.
