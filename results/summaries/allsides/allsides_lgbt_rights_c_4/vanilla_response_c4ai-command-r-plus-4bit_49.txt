SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists during his trip to Russia for the G-20 summit, according to a White House official. The meeting comes in response to international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported increased violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws were passed. Obama has been critical of the Russian laws but does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists will include representatives from groups supporting human rights, the environment, free media, and LGBT rights. This decision follows Obama's cancellation of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and the Syria crisis. Human rights organizations have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists and have encouraged him to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses. Putin has defended his government's actions, stating that he has normal relations with LGBT individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
