Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups in Russia, including LGBT rights activists, during the G-20 summit. It mentions that Russia has passed laws against promoting gay relationships to minors and banning adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism, including calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Obama doesn't support the boycott but has criticized the laws. He also canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes, like granting asylum to Snowden and blocking UN actions on Syria. Human Rights First supports Obama's meeting with activists, emphasizing solidarity with those affected by Russia's policies. Putin defends the laws, saying he has normal relations with the LGBT community.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Obama meeting activists, Russia's laws and their impact, international reactions, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting with Putin, and Putin's response.

I should make sure to mention the meeting's purpose, the laws, the consequences, and the broader context of US-Russia relations. Also, include that Obama doesn't support the boycott but criticizes the laws, and the significance of the meeting despite the canceled summit meeting.

Let me structure this logically, starting with Obama's meeting, then the laws and their effects, followed by the international response and Obama's position, and conclude with Putin's defense.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid extra details and stick to the main facts. Also, ensure it's under 200 words. Let me check the word count after writing the summary to make sure.
