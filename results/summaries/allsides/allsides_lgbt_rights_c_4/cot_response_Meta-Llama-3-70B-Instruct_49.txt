SUMMARY:
President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, as well as representatives from human rights, environmental, and free media groups, during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This meeting comes amidst international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by same-sex marriage countries. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against LGBT Russians, leading to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Obama has been sharply critical of these laws, stating that he is "offended" by the anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting sends a clear signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown on civil society and LGBT rights. Obama's decision to meet with activists is a strong statement against Russia's human rights abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
