Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups, including LGBT rights activists, during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. Russia has recently passed laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages, which has led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism. Human rights groups are pushing for a boycott of the Sochi Winter Olympics, but Obama doesn't support that. He has criticized the Russian laws but didn't cancel the meeting with Putin over issues like Snowden and Syria. The meeting with activists is seen as a stand against Russia's crackdowns.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: Obama's meeting with activists, the Russian laws, the impact on the LGBT community, international reactions, Obama's stance on the Olympics, and the broader context of US-Russia relations. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all essential aspects without going into too much detail.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is mentioned succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, following international criticism of Russia's laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoption by countries allowing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against Russia's LGBT community and calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. While Obama opposes the laws, he does not support boycotting the games. The meeting with activists is seen as a show of support for human rights, environment, and free media groups. The visit comes after Obama canceled a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its stance on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's decision to meet with civil society, urging further action against Russia's human rights abuses. Putin defended Russia's relations with its LGBT community, stating they are normal.
