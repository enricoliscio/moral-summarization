Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that President Obama is meeting with Swedish Prime Minister and then talks about Russia's laws against promoting gay relationships to minors. Human rights groups are reporting increased violence against LGBT Russians. Then it says Obama's meeting will include groups supporting LGBT rights, free media, and the environment. There's a White House official who confirms the meeting, and it's happening on Friday. The official didn't want to be named because the schedule isn't published yet.

Russia passed a law in June that's causing international criticism, and another law about adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups say violence against LGBT community has gone up. There's been a call to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, but Obama doesn't support that boycott because he doesn't want to punish American athletes. He's criticized the Russian laws though.

Obama canceled a meeting with Putin before the G-20 summit due to disputes, including asylum for Snowden and blocking UN action on Syria. Human Rights First supports Obama's meeting with activists, saying it shows solidarity. Putin responded by saying he has normal relations with these groups and awards them, so nothing's out of the ordinary.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main points: Obama meeting with activists, Russia's laws causing criticism and violence, Obama's stance on the Olympics, the canceled meeting with Putin, and the reaction from Human Rights First and Putin.

I should make sure to mention the key details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Let me structure it step by step, starting with Obama's meeting, then Russia's laws, the criticism, the canceled meeting, and the reactions.

I also need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all essential elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit, according to a White House official. This meeting follows international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries that recognize same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported increased violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws were enacted. While Obama opposes the laws, he has ruled out boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, citing a desire not to penalize American athletes. The meeting comes after Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to ongoing disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its stance on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's decision to meet with activists, calling it a show of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's restrictive laws. Putin, however, downplayed the issue, stating that relations with these groups are normal and that he often honors their achievements. END OF SUMMARY.
