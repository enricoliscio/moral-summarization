Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Obama meeting with various groups, including LGBT rights activists, during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. Russia has recently passed laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and another law against adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism, including calls for a boycott of the Sochi Winter Olympics. Obama has criticized the laws but doesn't support a boycott. He also canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes, like granting asylum to Snowden and blocking UN action on Syria. Human Rights First praised Obama's meeting with activists as a stand against Russia's crackdowns.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words: violence, passed, bans, laws, legislation, penalize, blocking, decision, stands, targeted, crackdown, abuses.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the laws leading to violence and the international response. I'll mention Obama's meeting, his criticism of the laws, the canceled meeting with Putin, and the praise from Human Rights First.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points and the moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed.

First, introduce Obama meeting with activists in Russia. Then mention the laws passed by Russia, the resulting violence, and international criticism. Include Obama's stance on the Olympics boycott. Note the canceled meeting with Putin and the reasons. Finally, mention Human Rights First's approval and the call for Obama to speak out against abuses.

Let me make sure each morally framed word is included without forcing them. For example, "passed" refers to the laws, "bans" describe the legislation, "violence" against the community, etc.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
