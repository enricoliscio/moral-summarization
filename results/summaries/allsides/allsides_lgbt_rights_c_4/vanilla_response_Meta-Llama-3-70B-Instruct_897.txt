SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia this week. The meeting comes amidst international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT individuals in Russia since the laws passed. Obama has been critical of the laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by the anti-gay legislation. The meeting is seen as a signal of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown on civil society and LGBT individuals. Obama's decision to meet with activists comes after he canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over issues such as Edward Snowden's asylum and Syria.
