SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent passage of laws that ban the promotion of gay relationships to minors and prohibit adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since these laws were passed. Obama has expressed strong criticism of these laws but stated last month that he did not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi to avoid penalizing American athletes. The meeting with activists is a clear signal that the United States stands against Russia's crackdown on LGBT rights and human rights abuses. Innokenty Grekov of Human Rights First applauded the decision, urging Obama to speak out against Russia's actions. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended his country's stance, claiming normal relations with LGBT individuals. This meeting is especially notable as it follows the cancellation of a meeting between Obama and Putin due to disputes over Russia's granting of asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN action against Syria.
END OF SUMMARY.
