SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia this week. The meeting will also include representatives from groups supporting human rights, the environment, and free media. This comes after Russia faced international criticism for passing laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT individuals in Russia since the laws passed. Obama has been critical of the Russian laws, but does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting is seen as a signal of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown on civil society and LGBT individuals. Human Rights First has applauded the decision, urging Obama to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm the US stance on LGBT equality and human rights.
