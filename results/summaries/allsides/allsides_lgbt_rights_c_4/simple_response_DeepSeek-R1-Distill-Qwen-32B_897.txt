Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about President Obama meeting with LGBT rights activists in Russia during the G-20 summit, in the context of Russia's recent laws against promoting gay relationships to minors and the international criticism that followed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main points seem to be:

1. Russia passed a law banning promotion of gay relationships to minors, leading to increased violence against LGBT individuals and international criticism.
2. President Obama is meeting with LGBT rights activists during his visit, which is seen as a show of support.
3. The meeting was organized after Obama canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes, like asylum for Snowden and Syria issues.
4. Human rights groups are applauding the meeting as a stand against Russia's crackdown.
5. Putin defends the laws, saying relations with LGBT people are normal.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include the moral aspects, like the criticism of Russia's laws and Obama's support for human rights.

I'll start by mentioning Russia's laws and the resulting criticism and violence. Then, I'll note Obama's meeting with activists as a response. I'll include the cancellation of the Putin meeting and the human rights groups' approval. Finally, I'll mention Putin's defense.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, ensuring all key points are covered without going over the word limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main moral issues highlighted in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Russia has faced international criticism for laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries recognizing same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. President Obama, while not supporting a boycott, has criticized the laws and plans to meet with LGBT rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This meeting, which also includes representatives from human rights, environmental, and free media groups, was arranged after Obama canceled a meeting with President Vladimir Putin due to disputes, including Russia's asylum for Edward Snowden and its stance on Syria. Human rights groups applaud Obama's decision, viewing it as a stand against Russia's crackdown on civil society and LGBT rights. Putin, however, defended the laws, stating that relations with LGBT individuals in Russia are normal.  
END OF SUMMARY.
