SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amidst international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and increased violence against LGBT individuals. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws passed. The meeting is a clear signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by the anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting comes after Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a string of disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of action against Syria. Putin has downplayed the criticism, claiming that he has "absolutely normal relations" with the LGBT community. Obama's meeting with activists sends a strong message against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirms the US's commitment to LGBT equality and human rights.
