SUMMARY: President Obama took a moral stand against Russia's anti-LGBT laws and planned to meet with LGBT rights activists during his visit to the country for the G-20 summit. The Russian government had passed laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages, leading to increased violence against the LGBT community. Human rights groups praised Obama's decision to show solidarity with the LGBT community and other marginalized groups in Russia, urging him to speak out against human rights abuses in the country. Putin defended his government's actions, claiming normal relations with LGBT individuals. Obama's planned meeting with Putin in Moscow was canceled due to disputes, including Russia's granting of asylum to Edward Snowden and its position on Syria. Human rights activists urged Obama to use his platform to continue advocating for LGBT equality and human rights worldwide.
END OF SUMMARY.
