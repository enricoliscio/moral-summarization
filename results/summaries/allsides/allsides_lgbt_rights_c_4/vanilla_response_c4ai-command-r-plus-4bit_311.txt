SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This meeting comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community following these laws. President Obama has criticized these laws but does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists is intended to show solidarity and support for LGBT rights and human rights in Russia. Putin has defended his relationship with the LGBT community, stating that he works with them and has awarded them state prizes. Obama's meeting with activists follows a canceled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and the Syria conflict. Human rights organizations have praised Obama's decision to meet with activists.
