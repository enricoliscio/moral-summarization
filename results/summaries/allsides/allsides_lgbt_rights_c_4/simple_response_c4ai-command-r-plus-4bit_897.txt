SUMMARY: President Obama took a stand against Russia's anti-gay legislation by scheduling a meeting with LGBT rights activists while in Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision came after international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages, with human rights groups reporting increased violence against the LGBT community in Russia. Obama's meeting with activists sends a clear message of solidarity with those targeted by the crackdown and reinforces the United States' commitment to LGBT equality and human rights. In contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed the international criticism, claiming to have "absolutely normal relations" with LGBT people and awarding them state prizes. This summary highlights the moral stance of President Obama and human rights groups against the discriminatory and harmful legislation passed by Russia, with a focus on the impact on the LGBT community.
