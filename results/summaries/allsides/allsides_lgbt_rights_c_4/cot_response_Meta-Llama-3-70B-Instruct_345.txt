SUMMARY:
President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, despite the country's controversial laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by same-sex couples. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT individuals since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of these laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than him by such anti-gay legislation. The meeting is seen as a signal of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Human rights groups are urging Obama to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and reaffirm the US stance on LGBT equality and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
