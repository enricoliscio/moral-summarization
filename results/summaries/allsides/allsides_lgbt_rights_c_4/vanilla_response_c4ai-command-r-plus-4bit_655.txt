SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with LGBT rights activists in Russia during his visit for the G-20 summit. This meeting comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community following these laws. Obama has been critical of these laws but does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting with activists is intended to show solidarity and support for LGBT rights and human rights in Russia. This decision follows Obama's cancellation of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and Syria. Human rights organizations have praised Obama's decision to meet with activists. Putin has defended his government's actions, stating that he has normal relations with LGBT individuals and has even awarded them state prizes.
END OF SUMMARY.
