Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of the main points. It's about President Obama meeting with Russian activists, including those from the LGBT community, during the G-20 summit. Russia has passed laws against promoting gay relationships to minors and has banned adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. There's been an increase in violence against LGBT people, leading to calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics. Obama doesn't support the boycott but criticizes the laws. He also canceled a meeting with Putin over other issues, like Snowden and Syria. Human Rights First approves of Obama meeting the activists, and Putin defends his government's stance.

Now, for step one, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- **Critics**: People who disapprove or find fault.
- **Violence**: Use of physical force causing injury or death.
- **Oppression**: Unjust or cruel treatment.
- **Boycott**: Refusal to participate in something as a form of protest.
- **Penalize**: Punish someone for an offense.
- **Solidarity**: Unity or support with a group.
- **Abuses**: Wrongful treatment of people.
- **Equality**: Equal treatment and rights for all.
- **Human rights**: Fundamental rights inherent to all humans.
- **Crackdown**: Severe repression.
- **Scorn**: Disapproval or contempt.
- **Lobbying**: Persuading others to support a cause.
- **Achievements**: Successful completion of something.

Wait, some of these might not be single words as per the context. Let me double-check. The user said "single words that are morally framed." So each should be a single word. I think I got them all.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these moral terms as possible without making it too long. I'll structure it to cover the key points: Obama's meeting, Russia's laws, the impact on the LGBT community, the boycott calls, Obama's stance, the canceled meeting with Putin, and the response from Human Rights First.

I'll start by stating Obama's meeting, then mention the laws and their effects, the boycott, his criticism, the canceled meeting, and the support from Human Rights First. I'll make sure to include words like criticized, violence, oppression, solidarity, equality, human rights, etc.

Let me draft that. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

**Summary:**

President Obama is meeting with Russian civil society groups, including LGBT activists, during the G-20 summit, highlighting solidarity with those facing oppression. Russia's recent laws banning promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages have led to increased violence against the LGBT community, sparking international criticism and calls for a boycott of the Sochi Olympics. While Obama opposes the boycott, he has sharply criticized these laws. The meeting follows the cancellation of a planned summit with Putin due to disputes, including Snowden's asylum and Syria. Human Rights First applauds Obama's support for equality and human rights, urging him to continue speaking out against Russia's abuses. Putin defends his government's actions, claiming normal relations with activists. END OF SUMMARY.
