SUMMARY:
During the G-20 summit in Russia, President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, as well as representatives from groups supporting human rights, the environment, and free media. This meeting comes after Russia faced international criticism for passing a law banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors, leading to increased violence against LGBT Russians. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws, stating that "nobody is more offended" than he is by such anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting sends a clear signal that the United States stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Human rights groups have reported an uptick in violence against the LGBT community since the laws passed. Obama's decision to meet with activists is seen as a strong stance against Russia's human rights abuses and in support of LGBT equality. END OF SUMMARY.
