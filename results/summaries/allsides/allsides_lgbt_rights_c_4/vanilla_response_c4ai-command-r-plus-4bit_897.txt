SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with LGBT rights activists while attending the G-20 summit in Russia. This meeting comes as a response to the international criticism Russia has faced due to its recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since these laws were passed. Obama has expressed his opposition to the laws but does not support boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Instead, he plans to show his support for LGBT rights and human rights by meeting with activists. This meeting also follows Obama's cancellation of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over Edward Snowden and Syria. Human rights organizations have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists. Putin has defended Russia's record on LGBT rights, stating that he has normal relations with LGBT individuals and has even awarded them state prizes. END OF SUMMARY.
