SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, as well as representatives from human rights, environmental, and free media groups, during the G-20 summit in Russia. This meeting comes amid international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by same-sex marriage countries. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws passed. Obama has been critical of the laws, but opposes boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting is seen as a signal of US solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. Russian President Vladimir Putin has downplayed the criticism, saying he has normal relations with the LGBT community and awards them state prizes.
