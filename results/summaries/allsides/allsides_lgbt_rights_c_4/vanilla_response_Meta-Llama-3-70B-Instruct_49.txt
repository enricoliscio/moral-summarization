SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia. This meeting comes amid international criticism of Russia's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against Russia's LGBT community since the laws passed. Obama has been critical of the Russian laws, but has not supported a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The meeting will also include representatives from groups supporting human rights, the environment, and free media. Human Rights First has applauded the decision, saying it sends a clear signal that the US stands in solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. Russian President Vladimir Putin has addressed the international criticism, saying he has normal relations with LGBT individuals and does not see anything out of the ordinary.
