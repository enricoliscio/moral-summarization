Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Obama meeting with various activists in Russia, including LGBT rights groups, during the G-20 summit. Russia has recently passed laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and restricting adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. These laws have led to increased violence against the LGBT community and international criticism, including calls for a boycott of the Sochi Winter Olympics.

Obama has been critical of these laws, though he doesn't support boycotting the Olympics. He canceled a meeting with Putin due to other disputes, but still plans to meet with human rights and LGBT groups. Human Rights First supports this move, emphasizing solidarity with those affected. Putin, on the other hand, claims normal relations with the LGBT community.

Now, I need to summarize this while keeping the moral framing intact. The article highlights the moral issues of Russia's laws and Obama's stance against them. I should focus on the key events: the laws passed, the criticism, Obama's meeting, his opposition to the laws, the cancellation of the Putin meeting, and the human rights groups' support. I should also mention Putin's response to show the contrast in perspectives.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward, ensuring the moral implications are clear, like the impact on the LGBT community and the international response.
