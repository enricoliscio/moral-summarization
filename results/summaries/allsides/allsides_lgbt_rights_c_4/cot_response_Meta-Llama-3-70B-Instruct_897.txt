SUMMARY:
President Obama is set to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during the G-20 summit in Russia, amid international criticism of the country's laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against LGBT Russians since the laws passed. Obama has been sharply critical of the Russian laws, saying he is "offended" by the anti-gay and lesbian legislation. The meeting is seen as a signal of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's civil society and LGBT crackdown. Obama has also been critical of Russia's human rights abuses and has reaffirmed the US stance on LGBT equality and human rights. The meeting comes after Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a string of disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden.
