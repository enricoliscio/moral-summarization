SUMMARY:

President Obama will meet with LGBT rights activists and other human rights groups during the G-20 summit in Russia. This comes after Russia faced international criticism for passing a law banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors, leading to increased violence against LGBT individuals. Obama has been critical of the law, saying it offends him. The meeting is seen as a sign of solidarity with those targeted by Russia's crackdown. Human Rights First, which lobbied for the meeting, applauded the decision. Obama's meeting with activists will also include representatives from groups supporting free media, the environment, and others. This meeting comes after Obama canceled a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to disputes over issues like Edward Snowden's asylum and the Syrian crisis.
