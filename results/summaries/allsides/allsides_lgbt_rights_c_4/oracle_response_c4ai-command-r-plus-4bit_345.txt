SUMMARY: President Obama will meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent passage of laws that ban the promotion of gay relationships to minors and prohibit adoptions by countries that allow same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since these laws were passed. The legislation has sparked calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, although Obama has stated his opposition to such a boycott to avoid penalizing American athletes. Obama canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow before the G-20 summit due to several disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to Edward Snowden and its blocking of UN Security Council action against Syria. Human rights organizations have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists, urging him to speak out against Russia's LGBT crackdown and human rights abuses. Putin has defended his country's stance, claiming normal relations with LGBT individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
