SUMMARY: President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists during his visit to Russia for the G-20 summit. This decision comes amidst international criticism of Russia's recent laws banning the promotion of gay relationships to minors and adoptions by countries allowing same-sex marriages. Human rights groups have reported an increase in violence against the LGBT community in Russia since these laws were passed. Obama's meeting is intended to show solidarity with those targeted by Russia's LGBT crackdown and human rights abuses. While Putin denies any wrongdoing, claiming "normal relations," the international community, including Obama, has sharply criticized Russia's anti-gay legislation. Human rights advocates have applauded Obama's decision to meet with activists, urging him to speak out against Russia's human rights abuses and LGBT inequality. END OF SUMMARY.
