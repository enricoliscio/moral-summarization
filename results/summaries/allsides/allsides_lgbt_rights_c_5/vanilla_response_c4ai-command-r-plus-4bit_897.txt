SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a tricky decision regarding its position on gay marriage, with two briefs related to same-sex marriage cases expected to be filed in the U.S. Supreme Court by the end of the month. The more challenging case involves Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning gay marriage that was struck down as unconstitutional by lower courts. The administration has several legal routes it can take, including arguing for a fundamental constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples or taking a more limited approach that would invalidate Proposition 8 without affecting laws in other states. President Obama's evolving position on gay marriage adds to the complexity, with his inaugural address suggesting a more expansive view of equal rights. The administration's brief is highly anticipated by both supporters and opponents of gay marriage, but its impact on the Court's decision may be limited. Ultimately, the brief may be more about making a moral statement to the American public than influencing the Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
