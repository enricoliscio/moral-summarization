Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary needs to capture both the legal aspects and the ethical implications. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Obama administration's stance on the Proposition 8 case, which is about same-sex marriage in California. The administration is expected to file a brief, but the decision on what to argue is tricky because President Obama has changed his position over time. He initially supported state-level decisions but later seemed to endorse a constitutional right to marry.

I should highlight the legal and political challenges they're facing. The article mentions that the administration could take several approaches, from a bold defense of the right to marry to more limited arguments. It's important to note that both sides see this as a symbolic issue, which ties into the moral framing.

I also need to include the broader implications, like how a Supreme Court decision could affect laws in multiple states. Additionally, the article points out that while the administration's brief might not sway the justices much, it's significant for public perception on moral grounds.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes key points: the administration's dilemma, President Obama's evolving stance, the potential legal arguments, and the symbolic importance of the case. I'll structure it to first present the situation, then the possible arguments, and conclude with the moral and symbolic aspects.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a challenging decision on same-sex marriage as it prepares to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was struck down by a federal court, and the state has declined to defend it. The administration, while not legally required to intervene, is expected to file a brief, with the president personally weighing in on the arguments. The case raises significant legal and moral questions, including whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate laws in over 30 states. President Obama's stance has evolved: he initially supported state-level decisions on marriage but later endorsed a broader constitutional right to marry. The administration could argue for a constitutional right to marry, challenge California's reversal of marriage rights, or question the legal standing of Proposition 8's defenders. The case is seen as symbolic, with both sides urging the administration to take their position. While the brief may not significantly influence the justices, it could carry moral weight, reflecting the administration's stance on equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
