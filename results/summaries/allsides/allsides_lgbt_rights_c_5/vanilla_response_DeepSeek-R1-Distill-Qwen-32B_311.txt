Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, particularly regarding the Proposition 8 case. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by explaining that the Obama administration is facing tough decisions on gay marriage, with two briefs expected in the Supreme Court. The main focus is on Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. It was approved by voters in 2008, struck down in 2010, and the appeals court agreed but on narrower grounds. The state isn't defending it, so the initiative's sponsors are.

The article mentions that the administration isn't required to file a brief but will anyway. The question is what they'll argue. There are several legal options, including whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which would affect 30 states. Obama's stance has evolved: he initially thought states should decide but later suggested a broader constitutional right.

The summary needs to capture the key points: the administration's dilemma, Proposition 8's background, possible legal arguments, Obama's changing position, and the symbolic importance. It should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll structure the summary by introducing the administration's decision, the context of Proposition 8, the legal options, Obama's evolving stance, and the significance of the brief. I'll make sure to include that the administration isn't required to file but will, and the potential impact on the broader debate.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within limits. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration is grappling with a significant decision on gay marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California, which bans same-sex marriage. The case, which the president may personally decide how to argue, involves complex legal and political questions. Proposition 8, approved by California voters in 2008, was struck down by a federal court in 2010. The state has declined to defend the law, leaving its sponsors to argue the case. The administration, though not required to file a brief, will do so, with the content still undecided. Possible arguments include whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate laws in 30 states, or narrower issues like California's reversal of marriage rights. President Obama's stance has evolved, from supporting state-level decisions to suggesting a broader constitutional right. The administration's brief could influence public perception and the broader debate on gay marriage, even if its legal impact is limited. END OF SUMMARY.
