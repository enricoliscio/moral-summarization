SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a difficult decision regarding its position on same-sex marriage, with two briefs related to same-sex marriage cases expected to be filed in the U.S. Supreme Court by the end of the month. The trickiest case is that of Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage that was struck down as unconstitutional discrimination by lower courts. The Obama administration has the option to file a brief in this case, and the content of that brief will send a strong message, even if it may not greatly influence the Court's decision. The President's position on same-sex marriage has evolved over the past eight months, from endorsing same-sex marriage personally while leaving the decision to the states, to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry during his inauguration. The administration now has to choose between making a bold defense of the right to marry or arguing for more limited positions that would invalidate Proposition 8 in California while leaving laws in other states intact. The brief is highly anticipated by both the gay community and those advocating for traditional marriage, and its content will be a symbolic statement of the administration's moral stance on the issue, regardless of its legal impact.
END OF SUMMARY.
