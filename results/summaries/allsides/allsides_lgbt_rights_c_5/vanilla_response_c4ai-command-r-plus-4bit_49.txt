SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a tricky political and legal dilemma regarding its stance on same-sex marriage, with two briefs to be filed in the U.S. Supreme Court by the end of the month. The focus is on the Proposition 8 case from California, where a federal district court struck down the same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional discrimination. The administration's brief is eagerly awaited by both sides of the debate, as it could take a bold stance on the constitutional right to marry or argue a more limited position. President Obama's evolving views on same-sex marriage, from initially suggesting it should be left to the states to his more expansive language at his inauguration, add to the complexity. The administration's brief is symbolically important, even if its impact on the Supreme Court's decision may be limited. The brief could potentially be aimed at making a moral statement to the American public rather than influencing the Court's ruling.
END OF SUMMARY.
