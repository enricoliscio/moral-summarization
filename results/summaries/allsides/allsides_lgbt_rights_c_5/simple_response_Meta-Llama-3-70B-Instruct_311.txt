SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses tricky questions, with the administration's stance carrying significant moral weight. President Obama has changed his position on gay marriage, initially supporting states' rights to decide, but later suggesting a more expansive view of a constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including a bold defense of the right to marry, arguing that California cannot revoke the right, or that the distinction between same-sex couples and married couples amounts to discrimination. The decision is symbolic, with both sides urging the administration to take their side. While some argue that the administration's brief may not significantly sway the justices, others believe it will make a statement about what is morally right and wrong, resonating with Americans.

END OF SUMMARY.
