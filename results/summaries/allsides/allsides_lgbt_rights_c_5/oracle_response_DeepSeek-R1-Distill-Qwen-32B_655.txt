Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's administration facing a decision on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They provided a list of morally charged words that should be included if possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the legal and political challenges the Obama administration is facing. They have to file briefs in two cases, but the Proposition 8 case is more complicated. The case involves a California law banning same-sex marriage, which was overturned by a federal court. The state isn't defending it, so private sponsors are. The administration isn't required to file a brief but plans to. The key moral issues here are discrimination, constitutional rights, marriage equality, and the administration's stance on these issues.

I notice the article mentions the administration's shift in stance, from supporting state-level decisions to a more federal approach. There's also a comparison to interracial marriage, which adds a moral dimension. The moral words like "discrimination," "unconstitutional," "right," "marry," "equal," etc., are central to the framing.

In the summary, I should include these words and highlight the moral implications. I'll structure it to show the administration's dilemma, the potential impact on other states, and the symbolic importance of their decision. I'll make sure to mention the comparison to interracial marriage to emphasize the moral right to marry. Also, I'll note that the brief's content is undecided, which adds to the tension.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll start by stating the administration's challenge, then explain Proposition 8 and its legal background. Next, I'll discuss the administration's possible arguments and their implications. Finally, I'll touch on the symbolic importance and the anticipation from both sides.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear, focusing on the moral aspects. I'll ensure that the key points about discrimination, constitutional rights, and equality are highlighted. The comparison to interracial marriage will be included to stress the moral right to marry. I'll also mention the potential impact on other states if the court rules broadly.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. The goal is to present the information clearly while preserving the moral framing the author used.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a moral and legal dilemma over same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was deemed unconstitutional by a federal court for discriminating against gay couples after California briefly allowed such unions. The state has declined to defend the law, leaving its sponsors to argue in court. The administration, though not obligated to file a brief, plans to do so, raising questions about its stance. The brief could argue that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, akin to the right affirmed in interracial marriage cases, or take a narrower approach, such as challenging California's reversal of marriage rights. President Obama's evolving views—initially supporting state-level decisions, later advocating for equal treatment under the law—add complexity. The administration's position is symbolic, reflecting broader debates on discrimination, equality, and the legalizing of same-sex marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
