SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a tricky political and legal dilemma regarding its position on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of the Proposition 8 case in California. While the federal government is not required to file a brief in the case, it is expected to do so, and the content of that brief is highly anticipated by both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage. The key question is whether the administration will make a bold, full-throated defense of the right for same-sex couples to marry, or argue for a more limited position that would invalidate Proposition 8 in California while leaving laws in other states intact. President Obama's personal views on same-sex marriage have evolved over time, and his recent inaugural address suggested a more expansive view of equal rights for the LGBT community. The position the administration ultimately takes in this case is hugely important as a symbol, even if it may not have a significant legal impact on the Supreme Court's decision. The deadline for a brief siding with Proposition 8 supporters has passed, and the LGBT community is anxiously awaiting the content of the administration's brief, which is expected to be filed by the end of the month.
END OF SUMMARY.
