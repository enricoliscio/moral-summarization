SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court, with the Proposition 8 case from California posing tricky questions. The administration's brief will likely take a stance on whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate laws in 30 states. President Obama has changed his position on gay marriage, initially saying it should be left to the states, but later suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing that California cannot revoke the right to marry, or that the distinction between same-sex couples and married couples amounts to discrimination. The position taken by the administration is symbolic and important for both the gay community and traditional marriage advocates. The brief's impact on the Supreme Court's decision is uncertain, but it may serve as a statement on what is morally right and wrong.
