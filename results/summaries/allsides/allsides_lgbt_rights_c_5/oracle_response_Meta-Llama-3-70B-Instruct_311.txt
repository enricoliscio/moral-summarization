SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the federal government expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses tricky questions, as the administration must decide whether to argue for a constitutional right to marry, or take a lesser position. The case involves a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, which was struck down by a federal district court as unconstitutional discrimination. The Obama administration is not required to file a brief, but is expected to do so, with the president himself making the final decision. The administration's stance is hugely important, if only symbolic, as it will influence the national debate on gay marriage. The government could make a bold, full-throated defense of the right to marry, or argue that California's law is discriminatory because it extends all rights to same-sex couples except the right to marry. The decision will have far-reaching implications, potentially invalidating laws in 30 states.

END OF SUMMARY.
