SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a challenging decision regarding its stance on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of two upcoming Supreme Court cases: the Proposition 8 case from California and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) case. The administration's position on these cases has important implications for the gay community and those advocating for traditional marriage. While the president has previously expressed support for same-sex marriage, the specific arguments the administration will make in the Supreme Court briefs remain undecided. The article discusses several possible legal routes the administration can take, ranging from a bold defense of the right to marry to more limited arguments specific to California's Proposition 8. The article also highlights the symbolic significance of the administration's position, regardless of its potential impact on the Court's decision.
