SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions, and President Obama himself is expected to make the final decision on the Justice Department's arguments. The administration's stance will have significant symbolic importance, as it will influence the moral narrative surrounding gay marriage. The president's personal views on the issue have evolved, and his inaugural speech suggested a more expansive view of a constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, from a bold defense of the right to marry to narrower arguments about discrimination or legal standing. The gay community and traditional marriage advocates are eagerly awaiting the administration's decision, which will send a powerful moral message about what is right and wrong.
