SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the President himself expected to make the final call on the Justice Department's arguments in the Proposition 8 case at the U.S. Supreme Court. The case poses tricky legal and political questions, as the administration must decide whether to defend the California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage. The President's personal views on the matter have evolved, from initially supporting states' rights to legalize gay marriage to later suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, or that California's ban is discriminatory. The decision is hugely important, not just legally but also symbolically, with both sides of the debate urging the administration to take their side. Ultimately, the brief may serve as a statement on what is morally right and wrong, with implications for Americans beyond the Supreme Court.
