SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the President himself expected to make the final call on the Justice Department's arguments in the Proposition 8 case at the U.S. Supreme Court. The case poses a moral dilemma, as the administration must decide whether to take a bold stance on the constitutional right to marry, or argue lesser positions. The President's previous statements on the issue have been ambiguous, but his inaugural address suggested a more expansive view, stating that "our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law." The administration's brief will carry significant symbolic weight, as it will be seen as a statement on what is morally right and wrong. Same-sex marriage advocates are holding their breath, hoping the administration will take a strong stance in favor of equality and right. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications, potentially invalidating laws in 30 states. END OF SUMMARY.
