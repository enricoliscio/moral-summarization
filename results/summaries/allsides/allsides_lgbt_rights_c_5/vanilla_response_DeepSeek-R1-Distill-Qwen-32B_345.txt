Alright, I need to summarize this article about Obama's administration facing a decision on gay marriage, specifically the Proposition 8 case. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that the Obama administration has to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases. The Proposition 8 case is more complex because it's about whether the state can revoke a right it once granted. California's ban on same-sex marriage is being defended by the initiative's sponsors since the state isn't doing so.

I should note that the administration isn't required to file a brief but will do so. The main question is whether they'll argue for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, which would impact many states, or take a narrower approach.

Also, Obama's stance has evolved. He initially thought it should be a state issue but later suggested a broader constitutional right. His decision is crucial, and both sides are waiting to see the administration's position, which has symbolic importance.

I need to mention the legal arguments possible, like the state's inability to revoke a right once granted. The article also discusses how the administration's brief might not sway the Supreme Court much, but it's still significant for public opinion.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to cover the case details, the administration's involvement, the potential arguments, Obama's evolving position, and the implications of the brief. I'll keep it under 200 words, making sure to highlight the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration is set to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case, a U.S. Supreme Court case challenging California's ban on same-sex marriage. The case raises complex legal and political questions, including whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. While the administration is not required to file a brief, it will do so, but the content remains undecided. President Obama has shifted his stance on the issue, initially supporting state-level decisions but later suggesting a broader constitutional right to marry. The administration could argue that California cannot revoke a right it once granted, or that the case lacks standing since the state isn't defending the law. The brief's stance is significant for both the gay rights and traditional marriage advocacy communities, as it carries symbolic weight. The administration's decision could influence public perception and potentially set a precedent affecting same-sex marriage laws nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
