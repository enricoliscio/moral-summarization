SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage, as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses tricky questions, as the administration must decide whether to defend the ban on same-sex marriage. The president himself is expected to make the final decision, which could have far-reaching implications. The administration could argue for a constitutional right to marry, or take a more nuanced approach, such as arguing that California cannot revoke the right to marry once it has been granted. The decision is seen as hugely important, not just legally but also symbolically, as it touches on issues of discrimination, equality, and basic human rights. The gay community is holding its breath, hoping for a bold and full-throated defense of the right to marry. The administration's brief could make a statement about what is morally right and wrong, and its impact could be felt beyond the Supreme Court.
