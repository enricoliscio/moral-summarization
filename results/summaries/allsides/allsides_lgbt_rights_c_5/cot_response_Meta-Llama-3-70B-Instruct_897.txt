SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the federal government expected to file two briefs in a pair of same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions for the administration, with President Obama himself expected to make the final decision on what arguments the Justice Department will make. The case revolves around the California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, which was struck down by a federal district court as unconstitutional discrimination. The administration's brief will carry significant symbolic weight, with the gay community and traditional marriage advocates eagerly awaiting the government's stance. The president's own views on the issue have evolved, from endorsing same-sex marriage as a personal right to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, but its ultimate message will be seen as a statement on what is morally right and wrong. END OF SUMMARY.
