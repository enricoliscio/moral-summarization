SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court, including the Proposition 8 case from California. The administration's stance on gay marriage is crucial, as it could influence the court's decision on the constitutional right to marry. President Obama has changed his position on the issue, initially supporting state-by-state legalization but later suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration could take various legal routes, including a bold defense of the right to marry, arguing that California cannot revoke the right, or that the state's law amounts to discrimination. The gay community and traditional marriage advocates are eagerly awaiting the administration's stance, which could have symbolic importance. While some lawyers believe the administration's brief may not significantly impact the court's decision, others argue that it could make a statement about what is morally right and wrong.
