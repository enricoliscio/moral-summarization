SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing difficult political and legal questions regarding its position on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of the Proposition 8 case in California. The administration is expected to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, and the decision on what arguments to make is resting with President Obama himself. While the President has previously endorsed same-sex marriage from a personal perspective, the administration's position has significant implications for the gay community and those advocating for traditional marriage. The ultimate question is whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which is a highly divisive issue in many states. The administration could take a bold, full-throated defense of this right, or argue for more limited positions that would invalidate Proposition 8 in California while leaving laws in other states intact. The moral and symbolic significance of the administration's position cannot be overstated, and it will send a powerful message regardless of the legal outcome of the case.
END OF SUMMARY.
