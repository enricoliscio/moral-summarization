Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, particularly regarding the Proposition 8 case. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about how the Obama administration is facing a tough decision on whether to support or oppose Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. The case is before the U.S. Supreme Court, and the administration is expected to file a brief by the end of the month. It's noted that the president himself will make the final decision on what arguments the Justice Department presents.

Proposition 8 was passed in 2008, but a federal court ruled it unconstitutional in 2010. The state didn't defend it, so the initiative's sponsors are. The administration isn't required to file a brief, but they're doing so anyway, which adds weight to the case.

The article mentions that the administration has a few legal options. They could argue that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which would affect many states, or they could take a narrower approach, like arguing that California shouldn't revoke the right once granted. Another option is questioning the legal standing of the initiative's sponsors.

President Obama's stance has evolved. Initially, he supported same-sex marriage personally but thought states should decide. Later, he seemed to support a broader constitutional right. This is compared to the 1967 case about interracial marriage, where the federal government didn't take a position.

The article also discusses how both sides are trying to influence the administration, and there's speculation about whether the brief will have a significant impact on the court's decision. Some legal experts think it might matter less because the administration's position on DOMA is already known.

So, to summarize, the key points are:
- Obama admin must decide on Proposition 8 case.
- They're filing a brief despite not being required.
- Possible arguments include constitutional right or narrower issues.
- Obama's stance has shifted from state-level to a broader right.
- The brief's impact on the court is uncertain, but it's symbolically important.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words, focusing on the main aspects: the case, the administration's decision, possible arguments, Obama's evolving position, and the symbolic importance.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a significant decision on Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, as the case approaches the U.S. Supreme Court. While not obligated to file a brief, the administration plans to do so, with President Obama personally deciding its content. The brief could argue for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, a narrower stance on California's reversal of marriage rights, or challenge the legal standing of the initiative's defenders. Obama's stance has evolved from supporting state-level decisions to suggesting a broader constitutional right, akin to the interracial marriage case. The administration's position is symbolically crucial for both sides, though its direct impact on the court's decision may be limited. END OF SUMMARY.
