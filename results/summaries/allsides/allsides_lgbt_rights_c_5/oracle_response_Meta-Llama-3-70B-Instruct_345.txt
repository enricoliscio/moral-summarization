SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses tricky questions, with the administration expected to argue against the ban on gay marriage. The case revolves around the constitutional right to marry, with the administration's stance having significant implications for laws in over 30 states. President Obama has changed his position on the issue, initially endorsing same-sex marriage but leaving legalization to the states, and later suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various routes, including a bold defense of the right to marry, arguing that California's ban is unconstitutional discrimination, or that the state's law extending all rights to same-sex couples except marriage amounts to discrimination. The decision is hugely important as a symbol, with both sides urging the administration to take their side.
