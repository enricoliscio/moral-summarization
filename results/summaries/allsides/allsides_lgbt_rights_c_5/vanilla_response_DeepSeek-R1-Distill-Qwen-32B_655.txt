Alright, so I need to summarize this article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the Obama administration is expected to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases at the Supreme Court by the end of the month. The more complex case is Proposition 8 from California, which banned same-sex marriage. The state's voters approved it in 2008, but a federal court ruled it unconstitutional in 2010. The state hasn't defended it, so the initiative's sponsors are doing so.

Obama's position has evolved. He initially supported same-sex marriage personally but thought it should be decided at the state level. Later, he seemed to support a constitutional right to marry, similar to interracial marriage. The administration could argue several points: that California can't revoke a right it granted, that the distinction is discriminatory, or that the sponsors lack standing.

The brief's impact is uncertain. Some legal experts think it won't sway the Supreme Court much, but it's significant symbolically. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, within 200 words. I'll structure it by introducing the cases, focusing on Proposition 8, Obama's evolving stance, possible arguments, and the symbolic importance.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a significant decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file briefs in two Supreme Court cases, particularly the Proposition 8 case from California. Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was approved in 2008 but later deemed unconstitutional by a federal court. The state has not defended the law, leaving its sponsors to argue on its behalf. While the administration is not required to file a brief, it will do so, but the content remains undecided. President Obama's stance has evolved: he initially supported state-level decisions on same-sex marriage but later hinted at a constitutional right to marry. The administration could argue that California cannot revoke a granted right or that the law discriminates. The brief's impact on the Supreme Court is uncertain, but its symbolic importance is high for both sides. END OF SUMMARY.
