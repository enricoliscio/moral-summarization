SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court by the end of the month. The Proposition 8 case from California poses tricky questions for the administration, as it banned same-sex marriage in 2008. The administration is not required to file a brief, but it will do so, and the ultimate question is whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. President Obama has changed his position on gay marriage, and his administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing for a constitutional right to marry or making a more limited argument. The administration's stance is hugely important symbolically for both sides of the debate. Lawyers argue that the administration's brief may not make a big difference to the justices, but it could make a statement about what is morally right and wrong.
