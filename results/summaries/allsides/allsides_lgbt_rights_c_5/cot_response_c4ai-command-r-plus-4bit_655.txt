SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a tricky political and moral dilemma regarding its position on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of the Proposition 8 case in California. The federal government is expected to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, and the decisions made will have significant moral and legal implications. While President Obama has personally endorsed same-sex marriage, the administration must navigate the complex legal landscape surrounding this issue. The ultimate question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry remains unresolved, and the administration's stance could range from a bold defense of marriage equality to more limited arguments specific to California law. The position the government takes will be hugely important as a symbol for both the gay community and those advocating for traditional heterosexual marriage. The administration's brief is expected to make a moral statement about what is right and wrong, and its impact will be felt beyond the legal arena. END OF SUMMARY.
