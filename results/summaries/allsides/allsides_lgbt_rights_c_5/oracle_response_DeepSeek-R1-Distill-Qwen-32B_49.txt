Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They've provided a list of morally charged words that should be included, so I need to make sure those are in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is the administration's decision on whether to support or oppose Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. The case is before the Supreme Court, and the administration is expected to file a brief. The moral aspects involve discrimination, rights, equality, and the legal implications of same-sex marriage.

I need to highlight the moral terms like discrimination, unconstitutional, right, marry, legalizing, treated, equal, etc. The article mentions how the administration's stance could either support a constitutional right to marry or take a more limited approach. Also, the change in Obama's position from supporting state-level decisions to a more federal stance is important.

I should structure the summary to include the key moral points: the administration's decision's symbolic importance, the potential impact on states, and the moral arguments around equality and discrimination. I'll make sure to use the specified words and keep the summary concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it captures these elements without going into too much detail. I'll focus on the moral framing and include the necessary terms.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a moral and legal dilemma over same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case, where California's ban on gay marriage is being challenged. The administration must decide whether to argue that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, a stance that could invalidate similar laws in 30 states. The case is complicated by the fact that California briefly allowed same-sex marriage before Proposition 8 revoked the right, raising issues of discrimination and unconstitutional treatment. The administration could take a bold stance, arguing for a fundamental right to marry, or opt for a narrower approach, such as focusing on California's reversal of rights. President Obama's evolving position—initially supporting state-level decisions but later suggesting a broader constitutional right—adds to the complexity. The administration's brief, expected to be filed soon, could have symbolic significance, reflecting a moral stance on equality and discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
