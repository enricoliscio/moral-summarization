SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is facing a crucial decision on gay marriage, as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions, and President Obama himself is expected to make the final decision on the Justice Department's arguments. The administration's stance will be symbolic and morally significant, as it could influence the court's decision on whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Obama's personal views on the issue have evolved, from initially supporting state-level decisions to later suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing that California's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional discrimination or that the state's previous granting of marriage rights to same-sex couples cannot be revoked. The gay community and traditional marriage advocates are eagerly awaiting the administration's position, which will carry moral weight and potentially shape public opinion.
