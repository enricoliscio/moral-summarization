Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the administration facing a tough decision on whether to support or oppose Proposition 8 in the Supreme Court. The case is tricky because it involves both legal and political implications. The administration is expected to file a brief, but it's unclear what stance they'll take. 

The article mentions that President Obama has changed his position over time, initially supporting state-level decisions and later suggesting a more constitutional right to marry. This shift is important because it shows the moral evolution on the issue. 

I should highlight the legal arguments they might make, such as whether California can revoke the right to marry after granting it, or if the distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage is discriminatory. Also, the moral aspect is crucialâ€”advocates see this as a statement on what's right and wrong, beyond just the legal implications.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the administration's dilemma, the legal and moral arguments, Obama's evolving stance, and the potential impact on public perception. 

I'll structure it to first introduce the situation, then discuss the possible arguments, mention Obama's shift in opinion, and conclude with the broader moral implications. This should capture the essence while staying within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a pivotal decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was struck down by a federal court in 2010. The case raises complex legal and moral questions, particularly whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. While the administration could argue for a broad constitutional right, it might instead take a narrower approach, such as challenging California's revocation of the right to marry after it had been granted. President Obama's stance has evolved: he initially supported state-level decisions but later hinted at a broader constitutional right. The case is seen as a moral statement, with both sides advocating their positions. The administration's brief could influence public perception, though legal experts differ on its potential impact on the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
