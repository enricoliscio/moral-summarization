Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the Obama administration's stance on same-sex marriage, particularly regarding the Proposition 8 case. It mentions the legal and political challenges they face, including the potential for a Supreme Court decision that could invalidate state laws. The president's evolving views are highlighted, from supporting state-level decisions to a more federal approach. The administration's possible arguments are outlined, and the impact on both sides of the issue is noted.

I need to ensure that the summary includes words like discrimination, unconstitutional, right, marry, etc. I'll structure the summary to cover the key points: the administration's dilemma, the legal arguments, Obama's changing stance, the potential impact, and the symbolic importance.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll avoid technical jargon and focus on the ethical implications. Let me draft the summary, ensuring all important aspects are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a moral and legal dilemma over same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case, where the federal government must decide whether to argue that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was deemed unconstitutional by a federal court for revoking a fundamental right previously granted. The administration, though not obligated to intervene, plans to file a brief, leaving open questions about its stance. President Obama has shifted from supporting state-level decisions on marriage to suggesting a broader constitutional right, akin to the interracial marriage ruling. The administration could argue that California's repeal of same-sex marriage rights was discriminatory or that the case lacks standing without state defense. The decision carries symbolic weight, reflecting broader debates on equality and discrimination. Advocates on both sides await the administration's position, which could influence public perception and legal precedent. END OF SUMMARY.
