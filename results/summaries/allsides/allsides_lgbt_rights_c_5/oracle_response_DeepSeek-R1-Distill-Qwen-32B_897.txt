Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the Obama administration's stance on same-sex marriage, particularly regarding the Proposition 8 case in California. The administration is expected to file a brief in the Supreme Court, and President Obama's evolving views are a key point. The moral terms used include discrimination, unconstitutional, right, marry, etc.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the legal and political challenges, the administration's possible arguments, President Obama's shift from state-level decisions to a more federal stance, and the symbolic importance of the brief.

I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary by introducing the case, the administration's dilemma, Obama's changing position, the possible arguments, and the symbolic significance. I'll ensure to use words like discrimination, unconstitutional, right, marry, etc., to maintain the moral perspective.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it flows naturally and includes all necessary points while adhering to the word limit and moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a moral and legal dilemma over same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was deemed unconstitutional by a federal court, as it revoked a previously granted fundamental right. The administration, though not required to intervene, is expected to file a brief, with President Obama likely making the final decision. Obama's stance has evolved: he initially supported state-level decisions but later endorsed a broader constitutional right to marry, akin to interracial marriage rights. The administration could argue that California's revocation of the right to marry constitutes discrimination, or that the case lacks standing due to the state's refusal to defend Proposition 8. The brief's content is crucial for both the gay community and traditional marriage advocates, symbolizing a stance on equality and discrimination. While legal experts debate the brief's impact on the Supreme Court, its moral significance to the public is undeniable. END OF SUMMARY.
