SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is facing a critical decision on gay marriage, as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions, with the administration's stance carrying significant symbolic weight. President Obama has shifted his position on gay marriage, from leaving it to the states to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including a bold defense of the right to marry, arguing that California cannot revoke the right, or that the distinction between same-sex couples and married couples amounts to discrimination. The gay community and traditional marriage advocates are eagerly awaiting the administration's stance, which will send a powerful moral message about what is right and wrong. The brief's impact may extend beyond the Supreme Court, influencing public opinion and the national conversation on gay marriage. END OF SUMMARY.
