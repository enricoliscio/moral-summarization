Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify the morally framed words. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Obama's administration facing decisions on gay marriage, specifically the Proposition 8 case. It mentions tricky political and legal questions, which are morally charged because they involve rights and equality. I should note words like "tricky," "symbolic," "discrimination," "fundamental right," "constitutional right," "equality," "moral," and "justice."

Next, the summary needs to include these moral terms. I'll need to condense the article, focusing on the key points: the administration's decision, the legal and moral implications, Obama's changing stance, and the impact on both sides of the issue. I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the fight for equality and the administration's potential influence on public perception.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll start by stating the administration's dilemma, mention the Proposition 8 case, the legal arguments, Obama's evolving views, and the significance of the brief. I'll end by emphasizing the moral and symbolic importance, as the article suggests that the brief could influence public opinion more than the court's decision.

Let me check if I've included all the morally framed words. Yes, I think I've covered them. Now, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each point connects smoothly. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward, making sure the moral framing is evident throughout.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Obama administration faces a morally charged decision on gay marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. The case involves whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, a question with far-reaching implications for equality and justice. The administration must decide how to argue in court, balancing legal and political considerations. President Obama has shifted his stance, from supporting state-level decisions to suggesting a broader constitutional right to marry, akin to interracial marriage rights. Advocates on both sides see the case as symbolically important, reflecting broader moral debates about equality and justice. The administration's brief could influence public perception, highlighting the moral and symbolic weight of the issue.
