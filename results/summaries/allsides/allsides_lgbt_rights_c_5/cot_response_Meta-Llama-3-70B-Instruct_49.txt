SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the federal government expected to file two briefs in a pair of same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thornier questions, as the administration must decide whether to argue for a constitutional right to marry, leaving laws in other states intact. President Obama has changed his position, seemingly a lot, over the past eight months, from endorsing same-sex marriage as a personal view to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief will be hugely important as a symbol, with both sides urging the administration to take their side. Lawyers argue that the administration's brief may not make a big difference to the justices, but it could matter to Americans as a statement about what is morally right and wrong. The ultimate question is whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate laws in some 30 states.
