SUMMARY:
The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the President himself expected to make the final call on the Justice Department's arguments in the Proposition 8 case at the U.S. Supreme Court. The case poses tricky questions, as the administration must decide whether to take a bold stance on the constitutional right to marry, or argue for a more limited position. The President's personal views on the issue have evolved, from endorsing same-sex marriage as a state issue to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief will carry significant symbolic weight, as it will be seen as a statement on what is morally right and wrong. Same-sex marriage advocates are holding their breath, hoping for a strong defense of the right to marry, while traditional marriage supporters urge a more limited approach. The ultimate question is whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate laws in 30 states. END OF SUMMARY.
