Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the administration facing a tough decision on whether to support or oppose Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage in California. The case is important because it's going to the Supreme Court, and the administration's stance could have a significant impact.

The article mentions that the administration is expected to file a brief, but it's unclear what their position will be. There are multiple legal angles they could take, ranging from supporting a constitutional right for same-sex marriage to more limited arguments. The moral aspect here is highlighted by the author, who points out that the administration's brief isn't just a legal argument but also a moral statement on what's right or wrong.

I also need to note the shift in Obama's stance over time. Initially, he believed the decision should be left to the states, but later he seemed to support a more expansive view, suggesting a constitutional right. This shift adds a moral dimension to the case.

Additionally, the article mentions that the brief's impact might be more symbolic than legally decisive, as it's seen as a statement on morality rather than just a legal argument. This ties into the moral framing the user wants preserved.

I should structure the summary to include these points: the administration's dilemma, the possible legal arguments, the shift in Obama's stance, and the symbolic importance of the brief. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral aspect without getting bogged down in too many details.

Let me draft this step by step. Start with the administration's decision, mention the Proposition 8 case, the legal and moral implications, Obama's changing views, the possible arguments, and the symbolic significance. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together into a clear, concise summary that highlights the moral framing as requested.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a significant moral and legal dilemma as it prepares to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case, a U.S. Supreme Court case challenging California's ban on same-sex marriage. The case is particularly challenging because it raises the broader question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate similar laws in over 30 states. While the administration is not required to file a brief, it has decided to do so, and the content of that brief is under intense scrutiny. President Obama's evolving stance on the issue—initially advocating for state-level decisions but later suggesting a broader constitutional right—adds complexity. The administration could argue for a fundamental right to marry, or take a narrower approach, such as challenging California's reversal of same-sex marriage rights. The case is not just a legal battle but also a moral one, with both sides viewing the administration's stance as a symbolic statement on equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
