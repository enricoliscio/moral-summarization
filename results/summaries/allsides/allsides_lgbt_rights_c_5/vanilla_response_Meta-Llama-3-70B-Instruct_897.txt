SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is facing a critical decision on gay marriage, with a deadline to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court by the end of the month. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thornier questions, as the administration must decide whether to argue for a constitutional right to marry or take a more limited approach. President Obama has changed his position on the issue, initially saying it should be left to the states but later suggesting a more expansive view. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing that California cannot revoke the right to marry or that the law is discriminatory. The decision is symbolic and important for both sides, with same-sex marriage advocates hoping for a bold defense of the right to marry. However, some lawyers believe the administration's brief may not significantly influence the Supreme Court's decision.
