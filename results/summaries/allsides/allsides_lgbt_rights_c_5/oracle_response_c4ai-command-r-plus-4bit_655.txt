SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a challenging decision regarding its position on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of the Proposition 8 case in California. The administration must decide what arguments to make in the Supreme Court, with the president himself expected to make the final call. While President Obama has previously stated that legalizing gay marriage should be left to the states, his more recent comments at his inauguration suggested a broader view of a constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief in the Proposition 8 case is highly anticipated by both advocates for same-sex marriage and those for traditional marriage, as it will symbolize the government's stance on this issue. The brief is expected to take one of several possible moral stances, ranging from a bold, full-throated defense of the right to marry to lesser positions arguing against the revocation of rights or discrimination in California law. The brief's impact on the Supreme Court's decision may be minimal, but its statement on what is morally right and wrong could significantly impact Americans' perceptions.
END OF SUMMARY.
