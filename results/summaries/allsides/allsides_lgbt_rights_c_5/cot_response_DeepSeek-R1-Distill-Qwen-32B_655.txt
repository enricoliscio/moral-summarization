Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Obama's administration dealing with gay marriage cases, specifically Proposition 8. The task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article, then summarize the article while preserving those moral framings.

First, I'll tackle STEP 1. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "tricky," "symbolic," "constitutional," "discrimination," "fundamental," "unconstitutional," "equality," "equal," "basic," "pressure," "statement," and "morally" come to mind. These words are used to convey the ethical and legal implications of the issue.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into under 200 words, making sure to include those moral terms. The key points are: the Obama administration's dilemma on Proposition 8, the legal and political challenges, the change in Obama's stance, the potential impact on other states, and the moral implications of the case. I'll structure the summary to highlight these aspects, ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

I should also be concise and clear, making sure each point flows logically. I'll start by introducing the administration's challenge, then discuss the case details, Obama's evolving position, the possible arguments, and conclude with the broader implications and the moral stance involved.

I need to make sure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and that all the morally framed words are included. I'll review the summary to check for clarity and that all important points are covered without being too verbose.

Finally, I'll present the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

### SUMMARY:  
The Obama administration faces a challenging and symbolic decision on gay marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. The case involves whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, a question that could invalidate laws in over 30 states. While the administration is not required to file a brief, it plans to do so, leaving unresolved what stance it will take. President Obama has shifted his position on the issue, initially supporting state-level decisions but later advocating for a broader constitutional right to marry. The case is significant for both the gay community and traditional marriage advocates, as it carries moral and legal weight. The administration’s brief could argue for a fundamental right to marry, challenge California’s reversal of marriage rights, or question the legal standing of Proposition 8’s defenders. The decision is not only legally complex but also morally charged, reflecting the administration’s stance on equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
