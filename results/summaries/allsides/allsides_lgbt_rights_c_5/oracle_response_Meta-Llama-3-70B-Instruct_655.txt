SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the federal government expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions, as the administration must decide whether to argue for a constitutional right to marry, or take a more limited approach. The president's personal views have evolved, from endorsing same-sex marriage as a state issue to suggesting a more basic constitutional right to marry. The administration's brief will be symbolic, with both sides urging the government to take their position. Same-sex marriage advocates hope for a bold, full-throated defense of the right to marry, while opponents argue that the case doesn't belong in court. The administration's decision will have significant implications, as a Supreme Court ruling could invalidate laws in 30 states. The case raises questions of discrimination, equal treatment, and fundamental rights, with the administration's stance carrying moral weight.

END OF SUMMARY.
