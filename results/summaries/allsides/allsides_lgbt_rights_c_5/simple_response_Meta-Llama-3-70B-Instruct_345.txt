SUMMARY:

The Obama administration faces a crucial decision on gay marriage as it prepares to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thorny questions, with the president himself expected to make the final decision on the Justice Department's arguments. The administration could take a bold stance, arguing for a constitutional right to marry, or opt for lesser positions, such as arguing that California's revocation of same-sex marriage rights is unconstitutional. The decision is symbolic, with both sides of the debate urging the administration to take their side. While some lawyers believe the administration's brief may not significantly influence the justices, others argue that it could make a moral statement about what is right and wrong. The president's evolving stance on gay marriage, from supporting state-level decisions to suggesting a more basic constitutional right, adds complexity to the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
