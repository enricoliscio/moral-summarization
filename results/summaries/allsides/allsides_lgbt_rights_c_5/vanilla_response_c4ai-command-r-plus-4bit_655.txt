SUMMARY: The Obama administration is facing a tricky decision regarding its position on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of two upcoming Supreme Court cases: the Proposition 8 case from California and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) case. The administration's brief in the Proposition 8 case is particularly challenging as the president's personal views on same-sex marriage have evolved over time, and the outcome could have a significant impact on gay marriage laws in the United States. While the administration is not required to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case, it is expected to do so, and the content of that brief is still undecided. The article discusses various legal arguments the administration could make, ranging from a bold defense of the right to marry to more limited positions focused on California's specific circumstances. The ultimate question is whether the administration will endorse a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, which would invalidate laws in approximately 30 states. The president's evolving views and the symbolic importance of the administration's position add further complexity to the decision. However, some legal experts argue that the administration's brief may have less influence on the Court's decision than the public's perception.
END OF SUMMARY.
