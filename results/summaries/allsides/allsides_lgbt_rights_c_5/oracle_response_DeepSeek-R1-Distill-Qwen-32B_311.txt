Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Obama administration's stance on same-sex marriage, particularly regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user has specified to use as many morally framed words as possible from the list provided.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are:

1. The Obama administration is about to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases at the Supreme Court.
2. The Proposition 8 case from California is more complex, involving whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right.
3. Proposition 8 was a ballot initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California but was later struck down by courts.
4. The state isn't defending the law, so private groups are.
5. The administration isn't required to file a brief but will do so.
6. The brief's content is undecided, with several legal options, including arguing for a constitutional right to marry.
7. Obama's stance has evolved; he initially supported state-level decisions but later suggested a broader constitutional right.
8. The moral implications are significant, with both sides advocating their positions.
9. The administration's brief might not sway the Supreme Court but could influence public opinion on morality.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, using the morally framed words. I'll structure it to highlight the administration's decision, the moral implications, and the potential impact on public perception.

I'll start by mentioning the administration's decision to file a brief, then touch on Proposition 8's background. I'll note the possible arguments they might make, including the constitutional right to marry. I'll include Obama's evolving stance and the moral framing around equality and discrimination. Finally, I'll conclude with the symbolic importance and potential public impact.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating as many of the specified words as possible. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it concise, focusing on the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a moral and legal dilemma over same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was struck down by courts as unconstitutional discrimination. The state has declined to defend it, leaving private groups to argue in its favor. The administration, though not legally required, will file a brief, but its stance remains undecided. Possible arguments include defending a constitutional right to marry, challenging California's revocation of the right, or questioning the case's standing. President Obama's evolving views—initially supporting state-level decisions, later advocating for equal treatment under the law—add moral weight to the issue. Advocates on both sides see the brief as symbolic, reflecting broader debates on equality and discrimination. While legal experts doubt the brief will sway the Supreme Court, it could influence public perception of what is morally right. END OF SUMMARY.
