Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Obama administration's stance on gay marriage, specifically regarding the Proposition 8 case. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is on the administration's decision-making process on whether to support or oppose Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. The case is before the Supreme Court, and the administration's stance is crucial, both legally and morally.

I notice the article mentions that the administration isn't required to file a brief but will do so, which adds symbolic importance. President Obama's evolving stance is highlighted—initially supporting state-level decisions but later suggesting a constitutional right to marry. This shift is significant for the moral argument.

The legal aspects include possible arguments the administration could make, such as the state's role in revoking rights or the constitutionality of the law. The article also contrasts this with the interracial marriage case where the federal government didn't take a stance, drawing a parallel for the current issue.

I should highlight the moral implications, as the summary needs to preserve that framing. The article suggests that the administration's brief could serve as a moral statement, influencing public opinion beyond the legal outcome.

I'll structure the summary to include the administration's dilemma, the legal options, Obama's changing views, the symbolic importance, and the potential impact on public perception. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring all critical points are covered.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the case, the administration's involvement, the president's stance, the legal arguments, and ending with the moral and symbolic significance. This approach should capture the essence of the article and the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a significant moral and legal dilemma as it prepares to file a brief in the Proposition 8 case, which challenges California's ban on same-sex marriage. The case is particularly challenging because it raises the question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, a decision that could invalidate similar laws in other states. While the administration is not legally required to file a brief, it has chosen to do so, signaling the symbolic importance of its stance. President Obama's evolving position on the issue—initially supporting state-level decisions on marriage but later suggesting a broader constitutional right—adds complexity to the administration's potential arguments. The brief could argue that California, having briefly allowed same-sex marriage, cannot revoke that right, or that the law discriminates against same-sex couples. Alternatively, it could question the legal standing of the initiative's sponsors. The administration's decision carries moral weight, as it reflects broader societal values on equality and rights. The case highlights the tension between legal precedent and moral principle, with both sides advocating strongly for their positions. END OF SUMMARY.
