Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's administration dealing with the gay marriage issue, specifically the Proposition 8 case. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Obama administration's decision on how to argue in the Supreme Court cases regarding same-sex marriage. The main focus is on Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage. The federal government is expected to file a brief, but the content is undecided. The administration is in a tricky spot because President Obama's stance has evolved—he supports same-sex marriage but initially thought it should be decided by states, later suggesting a constitutional right.

I need to capture the key points: the two cases, the significance of Proposition 8, the legal arguments possible, Obama's changing position, and the implications of the administration's brief. Also, the article mentions that the brief's impact might be more symbolic than legally binding, as the Solicitor General's position might not sway the justices much.

I should structure the summary to include the main issues, the legal options, the political implications, and the potential impact of the administration's stance. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure to highlight the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise, covering all the essential elements without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a significant decision on how to argue in the U.S. Supreme Court regarding same-sex marriage, particularly in the Proposition 8 case from California. Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, was struck down by a federal court in 2010. The administration, though not legally required, plans to file a brief, but its stance remains undecided. The case raises questions about whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, which could invalidate similar laws in other states. President Obama's evolving position—initially supporting state-level decisions but later suggesting a broader constitutional right—adds complexity. The administration could argue that California's reversal of same-sex marriage rights was unconstitutional or that the case lacks standing due to the state's refusal to defend Proposition 8. The brief's impact may be more symbolic than legally decisive, as it could influence public perception rather than court rulings. END OF SUMMARY.
