SUMMARY:
The Obama administration faces a tricky moral dilemma regarding its position on gay marriage, specifically in the Proposition 8 case in California. The federal government is expected to file briefs in two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, with the Proposition 8 case presenting particularly thorny questions. The administration's position on gay marriage has evolved over time, with President Obama initially endorsing same-sex marriage on a personal level but leaving the legalization decision to individual states. However, during his inauguration, the president seemed to advocate for a more basic constitutional right to marry, regardless of sexual orientation. The administration now faces a choice between making a bold, morally right defense of the right to marry or arguing for more limited positions that would invalidate Proposition 8 in California while leaving laws in other states intact. The decision is important to both the gay community and those advocating for traditional marriage, as it will be a symbol of the administration's stance on gay rights. While the legal impact of the administration's brief may be limited, its moral statement on what is right and wrong could have a significant impact on Americans' perceptions.
