SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court, with the Proposition 8 case from California posing tricky questions. The administration is not required to file a brief, but will do so, with the president making the final decision on the arguments. The case involves a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage, which was struck down by a federal district court and appeals court. The administration's brief could take various legal routes, including arguing for a constitutional right to marry, which would invalidate laws in 30 states. However, the president's changing position on the issue adds complexity, with his inaugural speech suggesting a more expansive view of equality under the law. The administration's brief will be symbolic and important for both sides of the debate, with same-sex marriage advocates hoping for a bold defense of the right to marry. The brief's impact on the Supreme Court justices is uncertain, but it will likely make a statement about what is morally right and wrong.

END OF SUMMARY.
