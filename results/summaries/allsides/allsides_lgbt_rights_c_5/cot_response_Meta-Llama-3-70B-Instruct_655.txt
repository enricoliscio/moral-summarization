SUMMARY:
The Obama administration is facing a crucial decision on gay marriage, with the federal government expected to file two briefs in same-sex marriage cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Proposition 8 case from California poses thornier questions, as the administration must decide whether to argue for a constitutional right to marry, or take a more limited approach. President Obama's personal views on the issue have evolved, and his inaugural address suggested a more expansive view of equality under the law. The administration's brief will be hugely important as a symbol, with both sides of the debate urging the administration to take their side. While some argue that the brief may not make a significant difference to the justices, others believe it will make a statement about what is morally right and wrong. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications, potentially invalidating laws in 30 states. END OF SUMMARY.
