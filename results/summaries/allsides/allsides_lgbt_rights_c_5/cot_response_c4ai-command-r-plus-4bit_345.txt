SUMMARY: The Obama administration faces a difficult decision regarding its stance on same-sex marriage, specifically in the context of the Proposition 8 case in California. The administration must navigate complex political and legal questions while also considering the symbolic importance of its position to both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage. On one hand, the administration could take a bold stand and defend the right of same-sex couples to marry, which would be consistent with President Obama's personal endorsement of same-sex marriage and his inaugural address advocating for equal treatment under the law. On the other hand, the administration could choose to argue for more limited positions that would invalidate Proposition 8 without impacting laws in other states. The decision is further complicated by the fact that the administration has already taken a stance against the Defense of Marriage Act, suggesting that its position on same-sex marriage may already be clear. While the legal impact of the administration's brief may be minimal, its moral statement on the issue of same-sex marriage could have a significant impact on public perception and the ongoing debate surrounding marriage equality.
