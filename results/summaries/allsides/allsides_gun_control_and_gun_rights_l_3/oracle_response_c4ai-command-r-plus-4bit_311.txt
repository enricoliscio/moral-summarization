SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at a church in Texas, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct. Disturbingly, Kelley was still able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial for domestic violence. Kelley appears to have carried out the heinous massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church. Authorities have confirmed that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated but a result of a "domestic situation." The moral character of this act is further underscored by the arrest of activists from Gays Against Guns, who staged a die-in protest on Capitol Hill to demand stricter gun control in the wake of the tragic event.

END OF SUMMARY.
