SUMMARY: A senseless crime has shaken the community of Sutherland Springs, Texas, as a mass shooting at the First Baptist Church claimed the lives of 26 people, including innocent children and elderly individuals. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, was court-martialed by the Air Force for heinous acts of abuse against his wife and stepson. Despite this, Kelley was able to purchase an assault-style rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial to the federal database. Kelley appears to have carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church but absent during the shooting. Authorities have confirmed that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated, but a result of a domestic situation. The tragedy has sparked calls for stricter gun control, with activists from Gays Against Guns being arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill. END OF SUMMARY.
