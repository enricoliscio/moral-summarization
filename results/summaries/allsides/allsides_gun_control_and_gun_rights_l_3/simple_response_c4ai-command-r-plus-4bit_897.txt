SUMMARY: Yet another mass shooting in Texas has left 26 people dead, including children, elderly people, and a pregnant woman. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a man with a history of domestic violence and a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, yet he was still able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial. This tragic event highlights the senselessness of gun violence and the urgent need for stricter gun control measures. It also exposes the moral failing of a system that allows domestic abusers access to deadly weapons. The shooter's actions were motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, demonstrating the deep-seated issues of family violence that plague our society. The protest by Gays Against Guns on Capitol Hill is a powerful statement demanding an end to the scourge of gun violence and the moral imperative to prioritize human lives over gun rights.
