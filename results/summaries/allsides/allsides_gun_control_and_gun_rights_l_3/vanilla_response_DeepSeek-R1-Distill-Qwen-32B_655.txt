Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas. So, first, I should note the key points: 26 people died, including children and an elderly person, and a pregnant woman. The suspect is Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, from New Braunfels, Texas. He was in the Air Force from 2010 to 2014. He was court-martialed in 2012 for domestic violence, which involved abusing his wife and stepson. He got a bad conduct discharge in 2014. 

Wait, the Air Force didn't report his conviction to a federal database, so he could buy an assault rifle in 2016. He used that gun in the shooting. The motive seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member but wasn't there during the shooting. The spokesperson clarified it wasn't racially or religiously motivated. Also, there's a mention of activists protesting for gun control.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start with the shooting details, then the suspect's background, the Air Force's failure, the motive, and the protest. Make sure to mention the domestic dispute and the clarification on the motive. Keep it concise and include all important points without getting too detailed.
