SUMMARY: New details reveal a history of domestic violence and threatening behavior by Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old white man responsible for the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. Kelley, a former member of the U.S. Air Force, was court-martialed for repeatedly hitting, kicking, choking his wife, and attacking his stepson, causing the toddler a skull fracture. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report Kelley's domestic violence conviction, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle used in the massacre. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, who had received threatening texts from him. Seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding stricter gun control in response to the tragedy. This senseless crime has brought attention to the urgent need for stricter gun control measures and highlights the failure of the system to prevent guns from falling into the hands of dangerous individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
