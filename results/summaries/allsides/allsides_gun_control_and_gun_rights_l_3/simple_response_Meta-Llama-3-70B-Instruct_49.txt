SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claimed the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault-style rifle in 2016, which he used to carry out the massacre. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church. The senseless crime highlights the urgent need for stricter gun control measures to prevent such tragedies. Meanwhile, activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun laws.
