SUMMARY:
A devastating mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claiming the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report Kelley's domestic violence to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a gun in 2016. The massacre was reportedly sparked by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. Authorities have emphasized that the attack was not racially or religiously motivated, but rather a senseless crime rooted in a threatening domestic situation. In response, activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control. The tragedy has raised urgent questions about the need for improved gun safety measures.
