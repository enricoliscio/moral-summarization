Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, where 26 people were killed, including children and a pregnant woman. The shooter was Devin Kelley, a 26-year-old who had a history of domestic violence in the Air Force. He was court-martialed, but the Air Force didn't report his case to a federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. The shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. There's also a mention of activists protesting for stricter gun control.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points but stays under 200 words. I should highlight the moral issues like the failure of the Air Force to report his history, which led to the tragedy. Also, the domestic dispute context is important to show it wasn't racially or religiously motivated. I should mention the activists to show the reaction and call for change. I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure each key point is covered without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: start with the event, mention the shooter's background, the failure in reporting, the domestic dispute, and the activists' response. That should cover all the moral aspects the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspect, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, including a 2012 court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his conviction, the U.S. Air Force failed to report his case to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, emphasizing it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a Capitol Hill protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
