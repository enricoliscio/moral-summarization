SUMMARY: A senseless crime has shaken the community of Sutherland Springs, Texas, as new details emerge about the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, killed 26 people, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. Kelley, who had been court-martialed for repeatedly abusing his wife and attacking his stepson, was able to purchase an assault-style rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his domestic violence court-martial. The massacre appears to be the result of a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, who had received threatening texts from him. Authorities have ruled out racial or religious motives, instead pointing to a "domestic situation." The tragedy has sparked calls for stricter gun control, with seven activists from Gays Against Guns arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill. END OF SUMMARY.
