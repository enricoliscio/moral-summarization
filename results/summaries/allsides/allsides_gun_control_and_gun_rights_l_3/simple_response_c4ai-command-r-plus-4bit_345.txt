SUMMARY: New details reveal a history of domestic violence and a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old white male shooter who killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, at a church in Texas. Despite his history of violence, Kelley was able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial for domestic abuse. The massacre appears to have been motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church but was absent that day. This senseless crime, as described by the Texas Department of Public Safety, highlights the urgent need for stricter gun control, as demonstrated by the protest of Gays Against Guns on Capitol Hill. The protest resulted in the arrest of seven activists.
