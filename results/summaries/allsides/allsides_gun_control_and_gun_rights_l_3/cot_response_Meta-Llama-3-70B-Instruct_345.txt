SUMMARY:
A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killed 26 people, including children, elderly people, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite being confined for a year and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, Kelley was able to purchase a gun due to the Air Force's failure to report his domestic violence court-martial to a federal database. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. The crime is described as "senseless" and motivated by a "domestic situation" rather than racial or religious beliefs. The tragedy has sparked calls for stricter gun control, with activists from Gays Against Guns arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill.
