Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the mass shooting in Texas. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about a shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspect is a 26-year-old man named Devin Patrick Kelley. He was in the Air Force but was court-martialed in 2012 for domestic violence, including abusing his wife and stepson. He served a year in confinement and was discharged in 2014 with a bad conduct discharge. 

However, the Air Force didn't report his court-martial to a federal database, which allowed him to buy an assault rifle in 2016. He used this gun in the shooting. The motive seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member but wasn't there during the attack. Authorities clarified it wasn't racially or religiously motivated. 

Additionally, there's a mention of activists protesting for stricter gun control, but that's a smaller part of the article.

So, the key points are: the shooting incident, the suspect's background including his military history and domestic violence charges, the Air Force's failure to report his case, the gun purchase, the domestic dispute motive, and the clarification on the motive not being racial or religious.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all the main points concisely.
