Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, where 26 people were killed, including children and a pregnant woman. The shooter, Devin Kelley, was a former Air Force member who had a history of domestic violence. He was court-martialed in 2012 for abusing his wife and stepson, served a year, and was discharged in 2014. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to buy an assault rifle in 2016. He used this gun in the shooting. Authorities say the shooting was due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. It's emphasized that the motive wasn't racial or religious. Also, there's a mention of activists protesting for stricter gun control.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the tragedy, the shooter's background, the Air Force's failure, the domestic dispute motive, and the activists' protest. I should maintain the moral implications, such as the failure to report his history and the gun control angle.

Let me structure it: start with the event, mention the shooter's background and the Air Force's oversight, the domestic dispute motive, and end with the activists' response. Keep it concise and make sure to include all key points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: A tragic mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, resulting in the deaths of 26 individuals, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old former U.S. Air Force member, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for abusing his wife and stepson, leading to a one-year confinement and discharge in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to legally purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, emphasizing it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from "Gays Against Guns" were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
