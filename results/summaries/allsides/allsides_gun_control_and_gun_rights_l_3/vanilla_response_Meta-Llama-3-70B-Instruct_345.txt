SUMMARY:

A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday killed 26 people, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence. He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson, and was discharged from the Air Force in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report the incident to a federal database, allowing Kelley to purchase a gun in 2016. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church and received threatening texts from Kelley. The shooting was not racially or religiously motivated. In response to the tragedy, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control.

END OF SUMMARY.
