SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at a church in Texas, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was discharged from the Air Force for his crimes. Shockingly, Kelley was still able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial to the federal database. Kelley appears to have carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. Authorities have confirmed that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated but was a result of a "senseless" domestic situation. Activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding stricter gun control in the wake of this tragic incident. The tragic incident highlights the urgent need for stricter gun control measures and a comprehensive approach to addressing domestic violence and its deadly consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
