SUMMARY: A senseless crime and massacre took place on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, with 26 people losing their lives, including innocent children and elderly individuals. The *suspected shooter*, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley from Texas, had a history of domestic violence that the Air Force *admitted* they failed to report. This allowed Kelley to *problem*-free purchase an assault rifle, which he *reportedly* used in the shooting. Authorities believe Kelley's actions were due to a *domestic dispute* and *threatening* texts with his mother-in-law, who attended the church but was not present during the shooting. Despite the clear *appearance* that he *carried out the massacre*, the Texas Department of Public Safety *stressed* that the tragedy was not racially or religiously motivated but a result of a *domestic situation*. Activists from Gays Against Guns were *arrested* during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill, calling for *stricter gun control* in the wake of this horrific incident.
END OF SUMMARY.
