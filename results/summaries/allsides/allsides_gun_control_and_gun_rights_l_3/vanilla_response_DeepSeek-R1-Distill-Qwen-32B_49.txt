Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, right? 26 people died, including kids, elderly, and a pregnant woman. The shooter was Devin Kelley, a 26-year-old from New Braunfels. 

I need to note his background. He was in the Air Force, enlisted in 2010. Then in 2012, he was court-martialed for domestic violenceâ€”beating his wife, pointing a gun at her, and injuring his stepson. He served a year and got discharged in 2014. But the Air Force didn't report this to a federal database, so he could buy an assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the shooting.

The motive seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member but wasn't there during the shooting. Authorities clarified it wasn't racially or religiously motivated. Also, there was a protest by Gays Against Guns for stricter gun control, leading to arrests.

I should keep the summary under 200 words. Start with the shooting details, then Kelley's background, the Air Force's oversight, the motive, and the protest. Make sure to include all key points without getting too wordy. Let me structure it step by step to cover each part concisely.

Separately, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a gun control protest. END OF SUMMARY.
