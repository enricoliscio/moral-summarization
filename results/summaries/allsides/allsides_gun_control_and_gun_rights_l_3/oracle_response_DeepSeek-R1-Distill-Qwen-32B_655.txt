Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the words that carry moral weight.

The article talks about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, where 26 people were killed, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspect, Devin Kelley, had a history of domestic violence in the military, which led to his court-martial. However, the Air Force failed to report this to a federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. The shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member.

The author uses words like "mass shooting," "killed," "hit," "kicked," "choked," "pointed," "loaded," "attacked," "broke," "thrown," "failed," "report," "violence," "used," "massacre," "crime," "threatening." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the tragedy, the suspect's background, the failure of reporting, and the domestic dispute angle. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the severity and the negligence involved.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, resulting in the deaths of 26 individuals, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, pointing a loaded gun at her, and attacking his stepson, causing a skull fracture. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016. Kelley used this weapon to carry out the massacre. Authorities indicated the shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, who had received threatening texts from him. The crime was not racially or religiously motivated. Activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
