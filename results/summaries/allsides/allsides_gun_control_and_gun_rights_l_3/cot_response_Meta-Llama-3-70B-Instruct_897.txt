SUMMARY:
A "senseless” mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people, including children, elderly people, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his 18-month-old stepson, which resulted in a “bad” conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014. However, the Air Force “failed” to report Kelley’s domestic violence court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a gun in 2016. Authorities believe the massacre was carried out due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who received “threatening” texts from Kelley. The shooting was not racially motivated, but rather a result of a domestic situation. Activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
