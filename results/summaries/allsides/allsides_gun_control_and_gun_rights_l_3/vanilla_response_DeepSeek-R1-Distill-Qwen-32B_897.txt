Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, right? So, the main points are the event itself, the shooter's background, and some details about why it happened.

First, the shooting happened on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. 26 people were killed, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman. That's a lot of casualties, so I should mention that.

The suspect is Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man from New Braunfels, Texas. He was in the Air Force from 2010 to 2014. In 2012, he was court-martialed for domestic violence against his wife and stepson. He was confined for a year and discharged with a bad conduct discharge in 2014. That's important because it shows he had a violent history.

But here's a key point: the Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database. Because of that, he was able to buy an assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the shooting. So, the system failed to prevent him from getting a gun.

The reason for the shooting seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. She received threatening texts from him. The authorities clarified that it wasn't racially or religiously motivated, just a domestic issue.

Additionally, there's a mention of a protest by Gays Against Guns where seven activists were arrested, but that seems like a secondary point.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key points: the event, the shooter's background, the failure of the system, the domestic dispute motive, and the clarification on the motivation.

Let me structure it: start with the event, then the shooter's history, the system failure, the motive, and the protest. Make sure each point is clear and brief.

I should avoid any extra details and stick to the main facts. Also, use proper grammar and ensure it's all within the word limit.

Let me draft it:

The article details the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, were killed. The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old former Air Force member, had a history of domestic violence, including a 2012 court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the attack. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and stated it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control.

Wait, that's 103 words. I can add a bit more detail without exceeding 200. Maybe include that he was discharged in 2014 and the rifle model.

Revised:

The article details the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman, were killed. The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old former Air Force member, had a history of domestic violence, including a 2012 court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the attack. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and stated it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control.

That's 111 words. I can add more about the protest if needed, but it's probably better to keep it concise. Alternatively, I can mention the protest as a separate event without going into detail.

Final summary:

The article details the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman, were killed. The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old former Air Force member, had a history of domestic violence, including a 2012 court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the attack. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and stated it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control.

That's 111 words. I think that covers all the key points without being too lengthy.
