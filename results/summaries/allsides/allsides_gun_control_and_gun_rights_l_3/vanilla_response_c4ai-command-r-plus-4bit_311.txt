SUMMARY: New details reveal that the suspected shooter in the Sutherland Springs, Texas church shooting, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct. The Air Force admitted to failing to report Kelley's court-martial for domestic abuse, which allowed him to purchase an assault rifle used in the massacre. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church. Protests for stricter gun control have already begun following the tragedy.
