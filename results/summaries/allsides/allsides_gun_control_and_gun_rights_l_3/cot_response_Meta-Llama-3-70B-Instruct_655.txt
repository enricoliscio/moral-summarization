SUMMARY:
A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, resulted in the tragic deaths of 26 people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence. In 2012, Kelley was court-martialed for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his 18-month-old stepson, which led to a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report Kelley's domestic violence court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. The shooting was a senseless crime, and activists are demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
