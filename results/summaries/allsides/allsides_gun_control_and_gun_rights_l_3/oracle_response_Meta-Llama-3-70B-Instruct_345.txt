SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claiming the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his 18-month-old stepson, breaking his skull. Despite being confined for a year and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, Kelley's domestic violence record was not reported to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. The senseless crime was not racially motivated, but rather a result of Kelley's threatening behavior. The tragedy has sparked calls for stricter gun control, with activists demanding action on Capitol Hill.
