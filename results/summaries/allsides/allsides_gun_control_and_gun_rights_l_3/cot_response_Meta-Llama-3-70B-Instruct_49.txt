SUMMARY:
A devastating mass shooting occurred on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claiming the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley's motive was a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church. The senseless crime was not racially motivated, but rather a result of a threatening domestic situation. The tragedy has sparked outrage, with activists from Gays Against Guns demanding stricter gun control. The incident is a stark reminder of the need for stricter regulations and accountability.
