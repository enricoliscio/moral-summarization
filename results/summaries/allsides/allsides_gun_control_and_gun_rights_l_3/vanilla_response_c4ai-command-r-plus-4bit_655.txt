SUMMARY: New details have emerged about the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence. Kelley was court-martialed by the Air Force in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson, and was discharged in 2014 with a bad conduct report. However, the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database, allowing Kelley to purchase an assault rifle in 2016, which he used in the shooting. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. On Monday, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill calling for stricter gun control measures.

END OF SUMMARY.
