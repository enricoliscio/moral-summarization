Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure, so I should follow that. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "mass shooting," "killed," "children," "elderly," "pregnant," "repeatedly," "choked," "force," "broken," "failed," "problem," "massacre," "senseless," "domestic," "threatening," "stricter," "arrested." 

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping these morally charged words. The summary should be under 200 words and include all the key points: the shooting, the shooter's background, the Air Force's failure, the domestic dispute motive, and the activists' protest. I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each moral word is included where appropriate.

**STEP 1:**  
* Mass shooting  
* Killed  
* Children  
* Elderly  
* Pregnant  
* Repeatedly  
* Choked  
* Force  
* Broken  
* Failed  
* Problem  
* Massacre  
* Senseless  
* Domestic  
* Threatening  
* Stricter  
* Arrested  

**SUMMARY:**  
A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, used an assault rifle to carry out the massacre. Kelley had been court-martialed in 2012 for abusing his wife and stepson but was discharged from the Air Force in 2014. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase the gun used in the attack. Authorities stated the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
