SUMMARY: New details have emerged about the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence. Kelley was court-martialed by the Air Force in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson, but the Air Force failed to report this to a federal database, allowing Kelley to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the shooting due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church but was not present during the attack. A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed the dispute, stating that the shooting was not racially or religiously motivated. On Monday, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill demanding stricter gun control measures.
