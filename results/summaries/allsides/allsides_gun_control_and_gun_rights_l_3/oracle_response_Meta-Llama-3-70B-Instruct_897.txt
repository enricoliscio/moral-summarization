SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claiming the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his 18-month-old stepson, breaking the toddler's skull. Despite being confined for a year and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, Kelley's domestic violence record was not reported to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley's motive was a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, who had received threatening texts from him. The senseless crime has sparked outrage, with activists demanding stricter gun control. The Air Force's failure to report Kelley's violent past is a glaring oversight that contributed to this tragedy.
