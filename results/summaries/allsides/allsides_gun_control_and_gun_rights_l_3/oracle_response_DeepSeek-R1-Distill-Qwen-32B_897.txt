Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about a mass shooting and specified that I need to preserve the moral framing the author used. They also listed the morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The shooting happened at a church in Texas, killing 26 people, including vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. The suspect, Devin Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, which was not reported to the federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. The motive was a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words: shooting, killed, hit, kicked, choked, pointed, loaded, attacked, broke, thrown, failed, report, violence, used, massacre, crime, threatening.

I should summarize the article, making sure to include these words. I'll start by stating the event, then mention the suspect's background and the failure to report his history. I'll also note the domestic dispute as the motive and the activists' protest for gun control.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including all the required terms. I'll structure it to highlight the moral aspects, such as the senseless crime, the failure of reporting, and the domestic violence leading to the tragedy.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without using markdown. I'll review it to ensure all key points and moral framing words are included effectively.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, used an assault-style rifle to carry out the massacre. Kelley had been court-martialed in 2012 for hitting, kicking, and choking his wife and attacking his stepson, which broke the toddlerâ€™s skull. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase the gun legally. Authorities revealed that the massacre was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, who had received threatening texts from him. The attack was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
