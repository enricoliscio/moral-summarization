SUMMARY: New details have emerged about the tragic mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which took the lives of 26 innocent people, including children and elderly individuals. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, should never have been able to purchase the assault-style rifle used in the massacre. The Air Force's failure to report Kelley's court-martial for domestic violence, which included assaulting his wife and infant stepson, allowed him to pass a background check and acquire the weapon used in the shooting. The crime appears to have been motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church. This senseless act of violence has once again brought attention to the urgent need for stricter gun control measures, as demonstrated by the protests of Gays Against Guns on Capitol Hill. It is unconscionable that Kelley was able to legally purchase a firearm despite his violent past, and it is imperative that steps are taken to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

END OF SUMMARY.
