SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at a church in Texas, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct. Shockingly, Kelley was still able to purchase an assault-style rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial for domestic violence. Kelley appears to have carried out the heinous massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. Authorities have stated that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated but was a result of a "senseless" domestic situation. The shooting has sparked protests and demands for stricter gun control measures.

Kelley's history of violence and the failure of the system to prevent him from accessing weapons highlight the urgent need for stricter gun control regulations and better reporting of domestic violence offenses. The shooting has also brought attention to the issue of family disputes turning deadly, with the shooter choosing to massacre innocent people over a personal conflict. 

END OF SUMMARY.
