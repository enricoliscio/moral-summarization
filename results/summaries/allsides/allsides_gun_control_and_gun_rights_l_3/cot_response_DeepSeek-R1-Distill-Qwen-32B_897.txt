Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main event is a mass shooting at a church in Texas, with 26 fatalities, including vulnerable groups like children and a pregnant woman. The shooter, Devin Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, which is a moral issue. He was court-martialed and discharged from the Air Force but wasn't flagged in the federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. This is another moral point about gun control and background checks. The article also mentions a protest by Gays Against Guns, highlighting the activism around stricter gun laws.

For the first step, I need to identify all the morally framed words. Words like "mass shooting," "killed," "children," "elderly," "pregnant," "domestic violence," "court-martialed," "bad conduct discharge," "failed to report," "senseless crime," "domestic situation," "threatening texts," "racially motivated," "religious beliefs," "activists," "die-in protest," "stricter gun control." Each of these carries a moral weight, so I'll list them with asterisks.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary. I need to include the main facts: the shooting, the number of victims, the shooter's background, the Air Force's failure, the domestic dispute motive, and the activists' protest. I'll make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. I'll keep it under 200 words, ensuring clarity and preserving the moral context from the original article.

I should start by stating the event, mention the victims, then the shooter's history, the Air Force's oversight, the motive, and end with the activism. This structure will cover all the necessary points while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll avoid any technical jargon and keep the language straightforward to maintain the moral framing effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, including court-martial charges for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his record to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle. Authorities linked the massacre to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member. The attack was not racially or religiously motivated, officials stated. Meanwhile, activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
