Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas. 26 people were killed, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman. The shooter is Devin Kelley, a 26-year-old white man. He was in the Air Force but court-martialed for domestic violence in 2012. He was confined, discharged in 2014. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, so he could buy an assault rifle in 2016. He used that gun in the shooting. The motive seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. The authorities clarified it wasn't racially or religiously motivated. Activists were arrested for a protest demanding gun control.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: shooting, killed, hit, kicked, choked, pointed, loaded, attacked, broke, thrown, failed, report, violence, used, massacre, crime, threatening.

I should include as many of these as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and after the "SUMMARY:" token, ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure the summary: start with the shooting, the number of casualties, the shooter's background, his domestic violence history, the Air Force's failure, how he got the gun, the motive, and the protest. I need to use the listed words where appropriate.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the failure to report, the violence, the massacre, etc. Also, clarify that it wasn't motivated by race or religion.

Putting it all together, ensuring the summary is clear and includes the key moral points without being too wordy.

Meanwhile, activists protested for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
