Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, with 26 casualties, including children and an elderly person. The shooter, Devin Kelley, had a history of domestic violence in the military. The Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. The shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. Activists protested for stricter gun control.

I should highlight the moral issues: the shooter's violent past, the military's failure to report, and the domestic dispute as the motive. Also, mention the activists' protest. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include the key points without losing the moral implications.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence, was court-martialed in 2012 for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his case to a federal database, enabling him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the attack to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member. The incident was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
