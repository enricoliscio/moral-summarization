SUMMARY:

A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday left 26 people dead, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed and confined for a year for assaulting his wife and stepson. However, the Air Force failed to report the incident to a federal database, allowing Kelley to purchase a rifle in 2016. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church. The shooting was not racially or religiously motivated. On Monday, seven activists were arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control.
