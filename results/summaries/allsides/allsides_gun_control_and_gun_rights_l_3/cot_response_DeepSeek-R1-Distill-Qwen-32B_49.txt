Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to write a summary using those words where possible.

Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about a mass shooting at a church in Texas. The shooter is Devin Patrick Kelley, who had a history of domestic violence in the military. The Air Force failed to report his court-martial, allowing him to buy a gun. The shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. Activists protested for gun control.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find the morally framed words. These are words that carry a moral judgment. Let me go through the article again:

- Mass shooting: implies a negative act.
- Killed: the act of taking lives.
- Children, elderly, pregnant woman: vulnerable groups, highlighting the tragedy.
- Suspected shooter: implies guilt.
- Court-martialed: legal judgment for wrongdoing.
- Repeatedly hit, kicked, choked: violent actions.
- Loaded gun: dangerous tool.
- Broke toddlerâ€™s skull: severe harm.
- Failed to report: negligence.
- Bought a gun: enabled the crime.
- Massacre: a violent killing.
- Domestic dispute: family conflict leading to violence.
- Threatening texts: intimidation.
- Racially motivated: not the case here.
- Religious beliefs: not the motive.
- Domestic situation: the underlying cause.
- Die-in protest: a form of activism.
- Gun control: policy aimed at preventing violence.

I think these are the key morally charged words. I should list them each with an asterisk.

Next, the summary. I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I should mention the shooting, the victims, the shooter's background, the Air Force's failure, the domestic dispute, the non-racial motive, and the protest. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the gravity and the issues involved.

I should structure the summary to first state the event, then the shooter's history, the failure of reporting, the motive, and the aftermath with the protest. Keeping it under 200 words.

Let me draft it:

"New details about the mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, reveal that 26 people, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman, were killed. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, including court-martial charges for violently attacking his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his actions to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 rifle. Authorities linked the massacre to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member. The incident was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, activists protested for stricter gun control, highlighting the need for better background checks to prevent such senseless violence."

That should cover all the key points and include the morally framed words effectively.
