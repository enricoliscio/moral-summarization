Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key moral elements in the article.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, which killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The shooter was Devin Patrick Kelley, who had a history of domestic violence. He was court-martialed in the Air Force for abusing his wife and stepson. The Air Force failed to report his history to a federal database, allowing him to buy a gun.

I need to identify the morally framed words: shooting, killed, hit, kicked, choked, pointed, loaded, attacked, broke, thrown, failed, report, violence, used, massacre, crime, threatening.

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure the summary by first stating the event, then the shooter's background, the Air Force's failure, the motive, and the aftermath. I'll ensure each moral term is included where appropriate.

I should avoid any additional information not in the article and keep the tone consistent with the original moral framing. Also, I need to mention the activists' protest for context on the response to the shooting.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point and moral term is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, resulting in the deaths of 26 individuals, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, as well as attacking his stepson with enough force to break the toddlerâ€™s skull. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault-style rifle in 2016. Kelley reportedly used this weapon to carry out the massacre. Authorities stated the attack was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and not racially or religiously motivated. The shooter had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. Additionally, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
