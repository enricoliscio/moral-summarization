SUMMARY: A mass shooting occurred at a church in Texas, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct. Shockingly, Kelley was still able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial to a federal database. Kelley appears to have carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. This senseless crime has once again brought attention to the need for stricter gun control, as activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding just that. Kelley's history of violence and the threat he posed should not have been ignored, and the tragedy underscores the urgent need for a moral reevaluation of gun ownership and the responsibility of authorities to protect citizens from such atrocities. 

END OF SUMMARY.
