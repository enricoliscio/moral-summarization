Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, where 26 people were killed. The shooter, Devin Kelley, had a history of domestic violence. He was court-martialed, confined, and discharged from the Air Force. However, the Air Force failed to report his record, allowing him to buy a gun. The shooting was linked to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. There's also a mention of a protest for stricter gun control.

Now, I need to extract the main points and use the specified moral terms. I'll start with the shooting, the victims, and the shooter's background. Highlight the failed reporting by the Air Force and the domestic dispute. Conclude with the activists' protest. Make sure to include words like "massacre," "killed," "domestic violence," etc.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting from the event, then the shooter's past, the failure in reporting, the motive, and the aftermath. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the note on the protest.

Let me draft it, ensuring all key moral elements are included without making it too long. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his stepson, breaking the toddlerâ€™s skull. Despite this, the U.S. Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the massacre to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, who had received threatening texts from him. The crime was not racially or religiously motivated, according to officials. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
