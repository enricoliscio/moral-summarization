SUMMARY: 
A senseless mass shooting in Texas has left 26 people dead, including children and elderly individuals. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old white man with a history of domestic violence and a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force. The Air Force admitted to failing to report Kelley's court-martial for repeatedly hitting, kicking, choking his wife, and attacking his step-son, resulting in a skull fracture. Kelley was able to purchase an assault-style rifle with no problems due to this oversight and used it to carry out the massacre. Authorities believe the shooting was due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church but not present that day. They have stated that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated but a result of a "domestic situation." The tragedy has sparked protests demanding stricter gun control measures to prevent such atrocities from occurring again.
