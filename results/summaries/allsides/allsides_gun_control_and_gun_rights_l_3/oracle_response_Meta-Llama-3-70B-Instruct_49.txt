SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claiming the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his 18-month-old stepson, breaking the toddler's skull. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report Kelley's domestic violence court-martial to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016, which he used to commit the massacre. Authorities revealed that the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who received threatening texts from Kelley. The senseless crime has sparked outrage, with activists from Gays Against Guns demanding stricter gun control.
