SUMMARY: New details have emerged about the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, that left 26 people dead, including children and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old from Texas with a history of domestic violence. Kelley had been court-martialed by the Air Force for abusing his wife and stepson but was still able to purchase an assault-style rifle due to an error in reporting his conviction to a federal database. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church but was not present during the shooting. Protests for stricter gun control have already taken place following the tragedy.
