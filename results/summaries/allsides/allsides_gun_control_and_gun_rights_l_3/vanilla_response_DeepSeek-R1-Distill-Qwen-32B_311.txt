Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The article is about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, so I should note the location and the number of casualties. 

The suspect is Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old man with a history in the Air Force. I remember he had a court-martial for domestic violence, so that's an important detail. It's crucial to mention how the Air Force failed to report his conviction, allowing him to buy a gun legally. 

The motive seems to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. The spokesperson clarified it wasn't racially or religiously motivated, which is an important point to include. 

Additionally, the article mentions a protest by Gays Against Guns, leading to arrests. I should include that briefly as it's related to the broader issue of gun control. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main facts: the event, the suspect's background, the failure of reporting, the motive, and the protest. I'll structure it concisely, ensuring all key points are covered without unnecessary details. 

Finally, I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspect, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, including a 2012 court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson while in the U.S. Air Force. Despite his conviction and a bad conduct discharge in 2014, the Air Force failed to report his case to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a church member, and emphasized it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a Capitol Hill protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
