SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claimed the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man, had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase a rifle used in the massacre. The motive behind the shooting appears to be a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church. Authorities emphasized that the attack was not racially or religiously motivated. In response to the tragedy, activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control. The senseless crime highlights the urgent need for effective measures to prevent such atrocities.
