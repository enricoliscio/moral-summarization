SUMMARY:

A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday killed 26 people, including children, elderly people, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence and was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite being confined for a year and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, Kelley was able to purchase a rifle in 2016 due to the Air Force's failure to report his domestic violence court-martial to a federal database. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church and had received threatening texts from him. The shooting was not racially or religiously motivated. In response to the tragedy, seven activists were arrested during a die-in protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control.
