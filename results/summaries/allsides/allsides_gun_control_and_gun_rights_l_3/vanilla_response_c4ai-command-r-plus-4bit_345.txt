SUMMARY: New details reveal that the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was a 26-year-old with a history of domestic violence. Kelley served in the Air Force but was discharged in 2014 due to a court-martial for assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite this, he was able to purchase an assault rifle in 2016 as the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database. The shooting, which killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, appears to have been motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the targeted church. Authorities have clarified that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated. Protests for stricter gun control measures have already taken place, with seven activists from Gays Against Guns arrested during a die-in on Capitol Hill.

END OF SUMMARY.
