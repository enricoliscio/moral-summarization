Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the content and the moral implications. The article is about a mass shooting at a church, the shooter's background, his military history, domestic violence charges, and the failure of the Air Force to report his history, leading to him purchasing a gun. There's also a mention of a protest for stricter gun control.

For the first step, I need to identify all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong moral or ethical connotation. Let me go through the article again. Words like "mass shooting," "killed," "children," "elderly," "pregnant woman," "suspected shooter," "white man," "court-martialed," "repeatedly hit, kicked, choked," "loaded gun," "assault-style rifle," "massacre," "domestic dispute," "mother-in-law," "senseless crime," "domestic situation," "threatening texts," "racially motivated," "religious beliefs," "domestic situation," "thoroughly investigated," "protest," "stricter gun control," "die-in protest," "arrested."

I should list each of these words, each on a new line starting with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the key points: the shooting, the shooter's background, the failure of the Air Force, the domestic dispute motive, and the protest.

I need to ensure the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I'll start by stating the event, mention the shooter's background and his history of domestic violence, the Air Force's failure, the motive, and the protest. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to convey the gravity of the situation.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll make sure each point is concise but covers all necessary aspects. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to write the step-by-step identification and then the summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of domestic violence, including a court-martial for abusing his wife and stepson. Despite his violent past, the Air Force failed to report his record to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault-style rifle. Authorities linked the massacre to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. The incident was not racially or religiously motivated, according to officials. Meanwhile, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
