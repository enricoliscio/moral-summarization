SUMMARY:

A devastating mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, claimed the lives of 26 innocent people, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of violence, having been court-martialed in 2012 for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, pointing a loaded gun at her, and brutally attacking his 18-month-old stepson, breaking the toddler's skull. Despite being confined for a year and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, Kelley was able to purchase a Ruger AR-556 assault-style rifle in 2016 due to the Air Force's failure to report his domestic violence court-martial to a federal database. Authorities believe Kelley's motive was a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, who had received threatening texts from him. The senseless crime has sparked outrage, with activists demanding stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
