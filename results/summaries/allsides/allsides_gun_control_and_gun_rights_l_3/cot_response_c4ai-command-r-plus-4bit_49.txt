SUMMARY: A senseless crime and a massacre. That is how authorities described the actions of Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old white man from Texas, who shot and killed 26 people, including children and elderly individuals, at a church in Sutherland Springs. Kelley, a suspected shooter with a history of domestic violence, was court-martialed by the Air Force for repeatedly hitting, kicking, and choking his wife, and attacking his step-son, resulting in a bad conduct discharge. Despite this, Kelley was able to buy an assault-style rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his domestic violence charges to a federal database. Kelley appears to have carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. Authorities have stated that the crime was not racially or religiously motivated but was a result of a "senseless" domestic situation. Activists from the group Gays Against Guns were arrested while demanding stricter gun control in a die-in protest on Capitol Hill following the tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
