SUMMARY:

A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday left 26 people dead, including children, elderly individuals, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, was a former US Air Force member who was court-martialed in 2012 for domestic violence against his wife and stepson. Despite this, the Air Force failed to report the incident to a federal database, allowing Kelley to purchase a rifle in 2016. Authorities believe the shooting was motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who attended the church and had received threatening texts from Kelley. The incident was not racially or religiously motivated. In response to the shooting, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill, calling for stricter gun control.

END OF SUMMARY.
