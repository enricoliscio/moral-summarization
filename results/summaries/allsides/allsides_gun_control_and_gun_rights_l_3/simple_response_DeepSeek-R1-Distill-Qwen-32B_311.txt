Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a mass shooting at a church in Texas, where 26 people were killed, including children and a pregnant woman. The shooter was Devin Kelley, a former Air Force member with a history of domestic violence. He was court-martialed, but the Air Force didn't report his case to a federal database, allowing him to buy a gun. The article also mentions that the shooting was related to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a church member. Additionally, there's a part about activists protesting for gun control.

Now, the user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, I need to not only summarize the facts but also highlight the moral implications. The key moral points here are the failure of the Air Force to report the domestic violence, which led to the tragedy, and the ongoing issue of gun control. I should make sure these aspects are clear in the summary.

I should start by stating the event, then move on to the shooter's background, the failure of the Air Force, the domestic dispute angle, and end with the activists' protest. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: first the shooting, then Kelley's background and the Air Force's oversight, the domestic dispute motive, and the activists' response. I should avoid any personal opinions but present the facts with the moral framing intact.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary moral elements.

SUMMARY: A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, left 26 people dead, including children, the elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, a 26-year-old former U.S. Air Force member, had a history of domestic violence. In 2012, he was court-martialed for abusing his wife and stepson, leading to a one-year confinement and discharge in 2014. However, the Air Force failed to report his domestic violence conviction to a federal database, allowing him to purchase an assault rifle in 2016. Authorities linked the shooting to a domestic dispute involving his mother-in-law, a church member, though it was not racially or religiously motivated. Meanwhile, seven activists from "Gays Against Guns" were arrested during a protest advocating for stricter gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
