SUMMARY:

A mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday killed 26 people, including children, elderly, and a pregnant woman. The suspected shooter, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, was a former Air Force member who was court-martialed in 2012 for domestic violence against his wife and stepson. Despite being discharged with a bad conduct, Kelley was able to purchase a rifle in 2016 because the Air Force failed to report his court-martial to a federal database. Authorities believe Kelley carried out the massacre due to a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church. The shooting was not racially or religiously motivated. In response to the tragedy, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill, demanding stricter gun control.
