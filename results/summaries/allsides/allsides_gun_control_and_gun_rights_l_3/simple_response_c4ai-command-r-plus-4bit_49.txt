SUMMARY: New details reveal a history of domestic violence and a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old white male shooter who killed 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, at a church in Texas. Kelley was able to purchase an assault rifle due to the Air Force's failure to report his court-martial for domestic violence. The massacre appears to have been motivated by a domestic dispute with his mother-in-law, a member of the church, who had received threatening texts from him. Despite this, seven activists from Gays Against Guns were arrested while protesting for stricter gun control on Capitol Hill. This tragedy highlights the urgent need for stricter gun control regulations and a comprehensive approach to addressing domestic violence and its deadly consequences. The moral imperative to protect innocent lives and prevent future tragedies is clear, and we must demand action from our leaders to ensure that such horrific acts of violence become a thing of the past.
