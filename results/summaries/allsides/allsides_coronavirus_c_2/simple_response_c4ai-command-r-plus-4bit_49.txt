SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has turned into a domestic and global spreader of COVID-19 by continuing to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the pandemic, often under unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Despite testing limitations and positive cases among detainees, ICE has continued to carry out domestic and international flights, endangering the health and safety of those involved. Countries such as El Salvador and Honduras have cooperated with deportations under pressure from the Trump administration, resulting in the spread of the virus to their countries. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, tested positive for the virus while in an ICE detention facility and was still showing symptoms when he was deported. This is just one of many stories highlighting the immoral and irresponsible actions of ICE during the pandemic, putting thousands of lives at risk.
