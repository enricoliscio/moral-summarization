SUMMARY:
The Trump administration's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has been detaining, moving, and deporting immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic, putting lives at risk. Undocumented immigrants, like Admild from Haiti, were deported back to their home countries while still showing symptoms of the virus. ICE's "unsafe" conditions and "scattershot" testing have turned the agency into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. Detainees described "cramped and unsanitary" detention centers where social distancing was impossible. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE's actions have been morally reprehensible, with the agency prioritizing deportations over the health and safety of immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
