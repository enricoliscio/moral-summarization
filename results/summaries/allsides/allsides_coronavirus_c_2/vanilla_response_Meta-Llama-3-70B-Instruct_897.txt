SUMMARY:

A New York Times investigation has revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with at least 3,000 testing positive for the virus in ICE detention centers. Detainees have described cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible. Many have been deported while still showing symptoms, with at least 11 countries confirming that deportees returned home with Covid-19. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept deportees, promising humanitarian aid. ICE claims to have taken precautions, but its actions have contributed to the global spread of the virus.

END OF SUMMARY.
