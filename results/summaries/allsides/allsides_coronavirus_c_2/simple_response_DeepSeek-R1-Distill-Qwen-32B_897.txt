Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about ICE deporting immigrants, some of whom are sick with COVID-19, leading to the spread of the virus both domestically and internationally. 

First, I need to identify the key points. The main issues are ICE's continued detention and deportation despite the pandemic, unsafe conditions in detention centers, and the spread of COVID-19 to other countries. The moral angle is clear: ICE's actions are putting people's lives at risk and ignoring public health guidelines.

I should start by highlighting ICE's role in spreading the virus. Mention the deported individuals who were symptomatic and the countries that accepted them under pressure. It's important to note the conditions in detention centers and how they contribute to the spread. Also, include ICE's response, which downplays their role but continues deportations despite limited testing.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral implications are clear. The summary should convey that ICE's actions are unethical and harmful, emphasizing the human cost and the failure to prioritize public health.

SUMMARY:  
The New York Times investigation reveals how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of COVID-19 by continuing to detain, transport, and deport immigrants despite the pandemic. Many detainees, including Admild, an undocumented Haitian immigrant, were symptomatic or tested positive for the virus before being placed on crowded deportation flights. Detention centers were described as unsafe, with cramped conditions, inadequate protective gear, and limited testing. At least four deportees from India, Haiti, Guatemala, and El Salvador tested positive shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus cases in its facilities but continues to operate deportation flights, often moving sick detainees. Despite criticism, ICE claims it follows CDC guidelines, though testing remains limited. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras, under pressure from the Trump administration, have accepted thousands of deportees, some carrying the virus. The report highlights ICE's role in exacerbating the pandemic, raising ethical concerns about prioritizing deportations over public health.  
END OF SUMMARY.
