SUMMARY: ICE has continued to detain, move, and deport immigrants, spreading the coronavirus in the United States and abroad. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, and ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 COVID-19-positive detainees in its detention centers, with limited testing. The investigation reveals unsafe conditions and scattershot testing in ICE detention centers, with cramped and unsanitary conditions that make social distancing impossible and protective gear almost nonexistent. Immigrants described their experiences of being moved from state to state while sick with the coronavirus, and being deported while still showing symptoms. Countries have accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration and with promises of humanitarian aid. So far, 11 countries have confirmed that deportees returned home with COVID-19. ICE has defended its actions, stating that it has taken precautions and followed CDC guidelines. However, as of last week, ICE was still only able to test a sampling of immigrants before deportation. Deportation flights continue, despite the risks of spreading the virus further.
END OF SUMMARY.
