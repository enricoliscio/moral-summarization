SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has been a significant contributor to the spread of COVID-19 both domestically and globally. Despite lockdowns and other measures to prevent the virus's spread, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, often without proper testing or safety precautions. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with at least four deportees from different countries testing positive shortly after arrival. 

The investigation found that detention centers were cramped and unsanitary, making social distancing impossible and protective gear almost non-existent. Detainees were moved between facilities despite showing COVID-19 symptoms, and ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 positive cases among detainees. More than 750 domestic flights and 200 deportation flights were tracked, revealing the extent of ICE's movement of potentially sick detainees. 

Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration and with promises of aid. So far, 11 countries have confirmed COVID-positive deportees. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but its actions continue to fuel the pandemic, with deportation flights still ongoing. 

END OF SUMMARY.
