SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has contributed to the spread of COVID-19 domestically and globally by continuing to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the pandemic. Despite unsafe conditions and limited testing in detention centers, ICE has moved thousands of detainees across the U.S. and deported more than 40,000 immigrants since March. Several countries have accepted deportees, some of whom tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival, due to pressure from the Trump administration and promises of humanitarian aid. ICE has defended its actions, stating that it follows CDC guidelines and takes precautions. However, detainees describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, lack of protective gear, and limited testing. The investigation highlights the risks and consequences of ICE's actions during the pandemic.
