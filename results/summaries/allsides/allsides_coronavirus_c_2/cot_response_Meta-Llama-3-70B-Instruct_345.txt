SUMMARY:
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. Detainees have described "unsafe" and "cramped" conditions in detention centers, where social distancing was "near impossible" and protective gear was "nonexistent". Many deportees have tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries, with at least 11 countries confirming that deportees returned home with Covid-19. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept sick deportees, promising "humanitarian aid" in return. ICE has defended its actions, claiming to follow CDC guidelines, but its continued deportation of sick detainees has sparked outrage. END OF SUMMARY.
