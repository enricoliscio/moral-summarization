SUMMARY:

An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary detention centers where social distancing is impossible and protective gear is scarce. At least 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees have been confirmed in ICE detention centers. ICE has also deported thousands of migrants, including those who are ill with coronavirus, to other countries. Under pressure from the Trump administration, some countries have accepted deportees, including those with Covid-19. The governments of 11 countries have confirmed that deportees returned home with Covid-19. ICE claims to have taken precautions and followed CDC guidelines, but deportation flights continue.
