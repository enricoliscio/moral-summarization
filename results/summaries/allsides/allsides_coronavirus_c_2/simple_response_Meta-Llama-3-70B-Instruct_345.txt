SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and safety measures worldwide, ICE has continued to detain, move, and deport immigrants, many of whom have tested positive for COVID-19. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE detention centers have been hotbeds of infection, with cramped and unsanitary conditions, limited testing, and inadequate protective gear. Detainees have been moved from state to state, and deported to their home countries, often while still symptomatic. At least 3,000 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and many countries have accepted deportees who were infected. The Trump administration has pressured countries to cooperate with deportations, promising humanitarian aid. This morally reprehensible practice has put countless lives at risk, both in the US and abroad. ICE's actions have been a "time bomb" waiting to unleash the virus globally.

END OF SUMMARY.
