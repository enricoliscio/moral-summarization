Alright, I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. They have two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary. The user provided an example response, so I should follow that format.

Looking at the news article, it's about ICE deporting immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential spread of the virus. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to identify those words first. Words like "unsafe," "scattershot," "time bomb," "sick," "deportees," "unjust," "coercion," "exploitation," "dehumanization," "precarious," "inhumane," "global spreader," and "crisis" stand out as morally charged.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive. I'll start by mentioning ICE's role in spreading the virus, the unsafe conditions, and the testing issues. Then, I'll touch on the deported individuals, the countries involved, and ICE's response. I'll end with the moral implications, like dehumanization and the health risks.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and includes all key points from the article without being too verbose. I'll also make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone and message.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing each morally framed word and then the SUMMARY section, making sure to end with the specified tokens. I need to double-check that I'm not exceeding the word limit and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral perspective.

**STEP 1:**  
* unsafe  
* scattershot  
* time bomb  
* sick  
* deportees  
* unjust  
* coercion  
* exploitation  
* dehumanization  
* precarious  
* inhumane  
* spreader  
* crisis  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus by continuing to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants despite the pandemic. Unsafe conditions in detention centers, where social distancing and protective gear were almost nonexistent, created a "time bomb" for virus transmission. Many detainees, including those showing Covid-19 symptoms, were moved between facilities or deported, contributing to the spread of the virus. Over 750 domestic flights and 200 international deportation flights carried detainees, some ill, to other countries. Despite criticism, ICE claimed to follow CDC guidelines but admitted limited testing. The article underscores the moral implications of ICE's actions, including the exploitation and dehumanization of vulnerable individuals, and the global health risks posed by deporting sick detainees.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
