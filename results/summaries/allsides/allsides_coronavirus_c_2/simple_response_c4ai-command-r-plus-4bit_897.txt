SUMMARY: Despite lockdowns and global efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, turning itself into a spreader of the virus within the US and across the globe. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, with at least four interviewees testing positive shortly after their arrival in their home countries. The investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals alarming conditions in ICE detention centers, with cramped and unsanitary conditions, lack of social distancing, and inadequate protective gear. 

ICE's response to this crisis has been inadequate, with limited testing and continued deportations despite the risks. This situation has led to severe consequences, with countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepting sick deportees due to pressure and promises of aid from the Trump administration. The moral implications of these actions are profound, as they put vulnerable individuals and entire communities at risk, both within the US and internationally. This summary highlights the ethical dimensions of ICE's actions during the pandemic, raising questions about the responsibility of authorities in protecting public health and the rights of immigrants, even during a global crisis.
