SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how unsafe conditions and inadequate testing in ICE detention facilities have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, both within the United States and globally. ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the pandemic, often under unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Interviews with over 30 immigrant detainees describe cramped quarters, lack of social distancing, and limited access to protective gear. Some detainees, like Admild from Haiti, were even put on deportation flights while still symptomatic and showing positive COVID-19 test results.

Tracking data reveals over 750 domestic ICE flights and 200 deportation flights since March, many carrying migrants who were ill with COVID-19. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted these deportations, with over 6,000 deportees since March, due to pressure and promises of aid from the Trump administration. This has had devastating consequences, with at least 11 countries confirming that deportees returned home with COVID-19. Despite these revelations, ICE maintains that it follows CDC guidelines and takes precautions, even as deportation flights continue unabated. This situation raises serious ethical concerns about the treatment of vulnerable immigrant populations and the potential spread of a deadly disease.

END OF SUMMARY.
