SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how ICE's unsafe conditions and scattershot testing contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within the US and globally. Despite lockdowns and social distancing measures, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, often in cramped and unsanitary conditions with little protective gear. Immigrants and detainees described conditions that made social distancing nearly impossible, and some were moved or deported while exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. At least four deportees tested positive shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 COVID-19 cases among detainees, but testing has been limited. Over 750 domestic flights and 200 deportation flights have been tracked since March, potentially spreading the virus across states and countries. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration and with promises of humanitarian aid. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but their actions continue to put vulnerable individuals at risk. END OF SUMMARY.
