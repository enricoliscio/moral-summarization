Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about ICE deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. 

First, they mentioned two steps. The first is to identify all single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "deportation," "undocumented," "fled," "sick," "tested positive," "ICE," "detention," "nurse," "Tylenol," "reprisals," "unsafe," "scattered," "spread," "Trump administration," "countries," "cooperate," "deportees," "Cuban," "cramped," "unsanitary," "social distancing," "nonexistent," "time bomb," "interviewed," "positive," "limited," "tracked," "flights," "refugee," "Kyrgyzstan," "moved," "Pennsylvania," "Texas," "symptoms," "confirmed," "panicking," "die," "prison," "deportation flights," "migrants," "ill," "Trump administration," "pressure," "promises," "humanitarian aid," "cooperate," "El Salvador," "Honduras," "deportees," "April," "praised," "ventilators," "governments," "countries," "confirmed," "Covid-19," "ICE," "precautions," "CDC guidelines," "testing," "sampling," "deportation flights," "continue."

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and highlight the moral issues involved, such as the dangers of deporting sick individuals, the conditions in detention centers, and the role of the Trump administration in exacerbating the spread of COVID-19.

I should start by outlining the main points: ICE continuing deportations despite COVID-19, unsafe conditions in detention centers, deportees testing positive after returning, ICE's response, and the involvement of the Trump administration. I'll need to weave in the morally charged words to emphasize the ethical concerns.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without being too verbose. I'll also make sure to mention the consequences of these actions, like spreading the virus globally and the human cost involved.

Alright, putting it all together, the summary should convey the moral failure of ICE's actions during the pandemic, the unsafe conditions, and the impact on both the deportees and their home countries. I'll structure it to highlight the issues with deportations, the health risks, and the administration's role in pressuring countries to accept sick individuals.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights the moral failings of ICE's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undocumented immigrants, including Admild from Haiti, were deported despite testing positive for the virus, with ICE continuing to detain, move, and deport individuals even as the pandemic spread. Detention centers were described as cramped, unsanitary, and unsafe, with social distancing impossible and protective gear nonexistent. Immigrants like Yudanys and Kanate, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, faced dangerous conditions, with some testing positive for COVID-19 after being deported. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 positive cases in its facilities but has limited testing. Despite these risks, ICE flights continued to deport thousands, including sick individuals, to countries like El Salvador and Honduras, under pressure from the Trump administration. The article underscores ICE's role in spreading the virus domestically and globally, with at least 11 countries reporting deportees returning with COVID-19. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but continues to prioritize deportations over public health. END OF SUMMARY.
