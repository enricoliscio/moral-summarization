SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, putting thousands of lives at risk. Detainees have described cramped and unsanitary detention centers where social distancing is near impossible and protective gear is almost nonexistent, creating a "time bomb" for the spread of the virus. ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees, and has deported sick immigrants to other countries, putting pressure on those countries to accept them. The administration's actions have been reckless and irresponsible, prioritizing deportations over public health and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
