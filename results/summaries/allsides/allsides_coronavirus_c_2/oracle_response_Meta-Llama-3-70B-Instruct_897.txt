SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining, moving, and deporting immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a "time bomb" of unsanitary conditions and scattershot testing that has turned ICE into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. Undocumented immigrants, like Admild from Haiti, have been deported while still showing symptoms, with some countries accepting sick deportees under pressure from the Trump administration. At least 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees have been confirmed in ICE detention centers, with limited testing and cramped conditions making social distancing impossible. Deportees have been moved from state to state, with some testing positive shortly after arrival in their home countries. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines, but deportation flights continue, spreading the virus globally. The agency's actions have led to a humanitarian crisis, with countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepting over 6,000 deportees since March. END OF SUMMARY.
