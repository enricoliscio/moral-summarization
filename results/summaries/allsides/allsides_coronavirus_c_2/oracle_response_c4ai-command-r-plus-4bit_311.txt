SUMMARY: Despite lockdowns and global efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19, ICE has continued to detain, move, and deport immigrants, turning into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with at least four deportees testing positive shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed 3,000 COVID-positive detainees, but testing has been limited. The investigation reveals unsafe conditions in detention centers, with cramped and unsanitary conditions making social distancing impossible and protective gear almost non-existent. Countries have accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration and with promises of aid. So far, 11 countries have confirmed that deportees returned home with COVID-19. ICE has continued to deport sick detainees, with limited testing, and deportation flights still ongoing.
END OF SUMMARY.
