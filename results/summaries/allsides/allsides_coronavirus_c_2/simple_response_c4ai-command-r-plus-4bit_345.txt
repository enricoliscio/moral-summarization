SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how ICE's unsafe conditions and scattershot testing contributed to the spread of COVID-19 domestically and globally. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary detention centers with little to no protective gear, while tracking data shows ICE moving sick detainees across states and deporting them to other countries. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees, some infected with COVID-19, under pressure from the Trump administration. Despite its role in spreading the virus, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and continues deportations with limited testing. This collaboration exposes ICE's disregard for the health and safety of detainees, endangering lives in the name of immigration enforcement.
END OF SUMMARY.
