Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about ICE and the spread of COVID-19 during deportations. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article starts with Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, who was sick with COVID-19 symptoms but still deported. He was given Tylenol and put on a plane. It mentions that over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March. ICE continues to detain and move people despite the pandemic.

The New York Times and The Marshall Project did an investigation showing unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers, with overcrowding and lack of protective gear. Detainees describe these conditions as dangerous, like a "time bomb." At least four deportees tested positive after returning to their countries. ICE has over 3,000 confirmed cases but limited testing.

The article also talks about ICE flights moving detainees, including some who were sick. For example, Kanate from Kyrgyzstan was moved despite symptoms and later tested positive. There were over 200 deportation flights carrying possibly sick migrants to other countries. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted thousands under pressure from the Trump administration, which promised aid.

ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but can only test a sample of immigrants. Deportations continue despite the risks.

So, the key points are:
- ICE continues deportations despite COVID-19.
- Detainees in poor conditions with limited testing.
- Sick detainees being deported, spreading the virus.
- Countries accepting deportees under pressure from the U.S. government.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main issues: ICE's actions, unsafe conditions, spread of the virus, and the impact on receiving countries. I'll make sure to mention Admild's case, the investigation findings, the number of deportees, and the response from ICE.

I should also note that despite the risks, ICE continues its operations, which has led to the spread of the virus both domestically and internationally. The pressure from the Trump administration on other countries to accept deportees is another important point.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how ICE has continued deportations despite the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the spread of the virus. Admild, a Haitian immigrant, was deported despite showing symptoms, and over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March. An investigation by The New York Times revealed unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers, with overcrowding and inadequate protection, leading to at least 3,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Sick detainees, including Kanate from Kyrgyzstan, were moved despite symptoms. ICE flights have transported thousands, including potentially infected individuals, to other countries. Despite criticism, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but continues deportations with limited testing. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted deportees under U.S. pressure, with 11 nations confirming COVID-19 cases among returnees. END OF SUMMARY.
