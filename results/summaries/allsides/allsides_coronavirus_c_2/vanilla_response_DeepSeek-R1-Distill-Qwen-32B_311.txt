Alright, I need to summarize this article about ICE and the spread of COVID-19 during deportations. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article talks about Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, who was sick with COVID-19 symptoms but was still deported. He had tested positive while in detention and was given Tylenol instead of proper care. This isn't an isolated case; many detainees are in crowded, unsanitary conditions without proper protection. The New York Times and The Marshall Project did an investigation showing that ICE's practices are contributing to the virus spread both domestically and internationally.

ICE has continued detaining and deporting people despite the pandemic. They moved thousands, including some who were sick, leading to over 3,000 confirmed cases in detention centers. The article mentions specific examples like Kanate, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, who was moved despite showing symptoms and later tested positive.

Deportation flights have carried sick individuals to countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and others. Some countries accepted these deportees under pressure from the Trump administration, even though it led to COVID-19 cases in their populations. ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but still can't test everyone before deportation.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start with Admild's case, mention the unsafe conditions in detention centers, the investigation findings, examples of sick detainees being moved, the impact on other countries, and ICE's response. I'll make sure to highlight the spread both domestically and internationally, and the lack of adequate testing despite the risks.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I should avoid including too many specific names unless necessary. The key points are ICE's role in spreading COVID, the conditions in detention, the international impact, and ICE's response. I'll structure the summary to flow logically from the individual case to the broader issue.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has contributed to the spread of COVID-19 by continuing to detain, transport, and deport individuals despite the pandemic. undocumented immigrant Admild, who tested positive for the virus, was deported to Haiti despite showing symptoms, receiving only Tylenol from ICE officials. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project revealed unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers, with overcrowding and lack of protective gear, leading to a "time bomb" scenario for virus spread. At least four deportees from countries like Haiti and Guatemala tested positive shortly after arrival in the U.S. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus cases in detention centers but has limited testing. Despite concerns, ICE continues to operate domestic and international flights, including those carrying sick detainees. Some countries, under pressure from the Trump administration, accepted deportees, resulting in confirmed COVID-19 cases. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but acknowledges testing limitations. END OF SUMMARY.
