SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project found that ICE detention centers were overcrowded and unsanitary, making social distancing impossible. Many detainees, including those who tested positive for the virus, were deported to their home countries, putting others at risk. The Trump administration pressured countries to accept these deportees, promising humanitarian aid. As a result, countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted over 6,000 deportees since March, with many testing positive for the virus upon arrival. ICE's actions have been morally reprehensible, prioritizing deportation over public health and human life.
