Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided an article about ICE deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic and wants a summary that includes the morally charged words identified in the article.

First, I should go through the article and pick out all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "undocumented," "deportation," "detention," "coronavirus," "symptoms," "Tylenol," "fled," "fear," "lockdowns," "unsafe," "scattered," "spread," "pressure," "Trump administration," "countries," "sick," "deportees," "interviewed," "positive," "confirmed," "testing," "limited," "flights," "detainees," "symptoms," "panicking," "die," "prison," "track," "deportation," "migrants," "cooperate," "humanitarian aid," "accepted," "praise," "ventilators," "Covid-19," "governments," "returned," "positive," "precautions," "CDC," "sampling," "continue."

Now, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. The summary should highlight the main points: ICE's actions despite the pandemic, the unsafe conditions, the spread of the virus, and the moral implications of deporting sick individuals.

I should structure the summary to mention the collaboration with The New York Times, the specific case of Admild, the unsafe detention centers, the spread of the virus both domestically and internationally, ICE's response, and the criticism regarding their handling of the situation.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure to include the key moral terms and the main events without getting too detailed.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights the moral concerns surrounding ICE's deportation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undocumented immigrants, including Admild from Haiti, were deported despite showing symptoms of the coronavirus. Detention centers were described as unsafe, with overcrowding and lack of protective gear, making social distancing nearly impossible. ICE continued to move and deport detainees, including those who were sick, despite the risks of spreading the virus. Over 750 domestic flights and 200 international deportation flights carried migrants, some ill with COVID-19, to countries like El Salvador and Honduras, which accepted thousands of deportees under pressure from the Trump administration. ICE claimed to follow CDC guidelines but admitted testing was limited. The article underscores the ethical issues of deporting sick individuals and the potential global spread of the virus due to these actions. END OF SUMMARY.
