SUMMARY:
The New York Times investigation reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has turned into a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus, despite lockdowns and measures taken worldwide to prevent its spread. ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, creating "unsafe conditions" and "scattershot testing" that helped spread the virus. Detainees described "cramped and unsanitary detention centers" where social distancing was "near impossible" and protective gear almost nonexistent. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving from the US, and ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees in its centers. The Trump administration's "pressure" on countries to accept deportees, some of whom were sick, has led to the spread of the virus globally. END OF SUMMARY.
