SUMMARY: Even amid lockdowns and global efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, ICE has continued to detain, move, and deport immigrants from the United States, potentially becoming a domestic and global spreader of the virus. The New York Times and The Marshall Project investigation reveals unsafe conditions and inadequate testing in ICE detention facilities, with over 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases among detainees. Immigrants describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible and protective gear almost non-existent. Despite these concerns, ICE has continued to move detainees from state to state and deport them, with over 40,000 immigrants deported since March. Some countries, under pressure from the Trump administration and promises of aid, have accepted sick deportees, with at least four countries reporting positive COVID-19 cases shortly after receiving them. ICE has defended its actions, stating that it follows CDC guidelines and takes precautions, but with limited testing capabilities, the risk of spreading the virus remains high as deportation flights continue.
END OF SUMMARY.
