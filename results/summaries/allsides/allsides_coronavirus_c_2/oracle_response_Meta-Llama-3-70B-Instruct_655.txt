SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has continued to detain, move, and deport immigrants despite the risks of spreading the coronavirus. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was deported back to his home country while still showing symptoms of COVID-19, after being given only Tylenol by a nurse. This is not an isolated incident, as an investigation reveals that ICE has turned into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. Immigrant detainees describe cramped and unsanitary detention centers where social distancing is impossible and protective gear is scarce. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees, but testing has been limited. The agency has moved thousands of detainees across the country, including those who were sick, and has deported many to other countries, putting pressure on those countries to accept them. The Trump administration's pressure on countries to take in sick deportees has led to a humanitarian crisis.
