Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about ICE deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions an undocumented immigrant from Haiti who was sick but still deported. He tested positive for COVID two weeks before being on the plane. The nurse just gave him Tylenol. He was one of over 40,000 deported since March. 

ICE continued detaining and moving people despite the pandemic. The New York Times and The Marshall Project investigated and found unsafe conditions in detention centers. Detainees described crowded, unsanitary places with no social distancing or protective gear. At least four deportees tested positive after returning to their countries. ICE has confirmed 3,000 positive cases but limited testing. 

They tracked over 750 ICE flights with detainees, some sick. A refugee from Kyrgyzstan was moved despite symptoms and tested positive later. Deportation flights to other countries continued, some carrying sick people. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted thousands under pressure from Trump, who promised aid. 11 countries reported deportees with COVID. ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but can only test a few before deportation.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the unsafe conditions, testing limitations, ICE's role in spreading the virus, the countries involved, and ICE's response. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continued deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite unsafe conditions and limited testing. An undocumented Haitian immigrant, still symptomatic from COVID-19, was deported after receiving only Tylenol. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, with ICE flights transporting thousands, including some who were sick. Detention centers were described as cramped and unsanitary, with social distancing impossible and protective gear scarce. At least four deportees tested positive for COVID-19 after returning to their countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 positive cases among detainees but has limited testing. Despite concerns, ICE maintains it follows CDC guidelines, though it can only test a sampling of immigrants before deportation. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted thousands of deportees under U.S. pressure, with 11 nations confirming COVID-19 cases among returned migrants. END OF SUMMARY.
