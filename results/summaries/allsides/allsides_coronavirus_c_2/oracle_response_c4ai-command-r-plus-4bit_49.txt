SUMMARY: Despite the global pandemic, ICE has continued to detain immigrants, move them across states, and deport them back to their countries. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how unsafe conditions and inadequate testing have turned ICE into a spreader of the coronavirus, both domestically and globally. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, and at least four deportees from different countries tested positive shortly after arriving from the United States.

ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 COVID-positive detainees in its detention centers, but testing remains limited. Immigrants describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible. One detainee, Kanate, showed COVID symptoms but was still moved across states and later confirmed positive. Deportation flights continue, with over 200 flights tracked since March, carrying sick migrants back to their countries.

The investigation also highlights how pressure from the Trump administration, coupled with promises of humanitarian aid, has led some countries to cooperate with deportations despite the health risks. El Salvador and Honduras have accepted over 6,000 deportees, and at least 11 countries have confirmed COVID-positive deportees. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but their actions continue to endanger the lives of immigrants and contribute to the spread of the virus.
