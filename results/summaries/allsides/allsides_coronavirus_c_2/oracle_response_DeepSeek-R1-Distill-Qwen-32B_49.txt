Alright, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about ICE deporting undocumented immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the spread of the virus. The author uses words like "sick," "deport," "unsafe," etc., which carry moral weight.

I should start by identifying the key elements: Admild's experience, the conditions in detention centers, ICE's actions despite the pandemic, the spread of the virus, and the pressure from the Trump administration. I need to make sure the summary includes these points and uses the specified words.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Admild and his deportation while sick. Then, I'll talk about the unsafe conditions and ICE's role in spreading the virus. I'll include the cramped and unsanitary facilities, the lack of testing, and the fact that ICE continued deportations despite the pandemic. It's important to note the countries that accepted deportees and the consequences, like the spread of COVID-19.

I'll also mention ICE's response, saying they followed CDC guidelines but still continued flights. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary moral elements.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate words like "sick," "deport," "unsafe," "cramped," "testing," "spread," "pressure," etc. I'll ensure the flow is logical and covers all main points without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral concerns surrounding ICE's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was deported despite being sick and testing positive for the coronavirus. ICE continued to detain, move, and deport individuals, even as overcrowded and unsanitary detention centers created unsafe conditions. Testing was limited, and many detainees, including those showing symptoms, were transported on domestic and international flights. At least four deportees tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after arriving in their home countries. Despite criticism, ICE claimed to follow CDC guidelines but admitted it could only test a sampling of detainees. The Trump administration pressured countries like El Salvador and Honduras to accept deportees, some of whom were ill. ICE's actions have contributed to the spread of the virus globally, with 11 countries confirming cases linked to deported individuals. The agency's continued deportations raise ethical questions about its role in exacerbating the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
