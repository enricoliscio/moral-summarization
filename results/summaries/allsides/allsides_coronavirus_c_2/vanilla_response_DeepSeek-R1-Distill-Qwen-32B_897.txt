Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let's read through it carefully. The main points are about ICE deporting immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Admild, an undocumented Haitian, was deported even after testing positive and showing symptoms. ICE continued detaining and moving people, creating unsafe conditions. The article mentions crowded detention centers without proper gear, leading to virus spread. They tracked over 750 domestic flights and 200 international ones, some carrying sick individuals. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted deportees under pressure, and 11 nations reported COVID-19 cases from returned immigrants. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but still can't test everyone. I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, focusing on ICE's actions, the health risks, and the international impact. Make sure to include key statistics and the human element, like Admild's experience. Also, note the criticism of ICE's role in spreading the virus despite precautions.
