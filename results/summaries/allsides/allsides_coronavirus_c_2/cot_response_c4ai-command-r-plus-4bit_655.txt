SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE's unsafe conditions and scattershot testing have turned it into a domestic and global spreader of COVID-19. Despite lockdowns and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, with over 40,000 deported since March. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, lack of protective gear, and near-impossible social distancing. ICE has confirmed 3,000 COVID-positive detainees, and tracking shows hundreds of domestic flights carrying detainees and deportation flights to other countries. Under pressure from the Trump administration, some nations have accepted deportees, even those infected with COVID-19. Countries that cooperated were promised humanitarian aid and ventilators for their sickest patients. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but their testing capabilities remain limited. The investigation highlights the dangerous and inhumane treatment of immigrants during the pandemic.
