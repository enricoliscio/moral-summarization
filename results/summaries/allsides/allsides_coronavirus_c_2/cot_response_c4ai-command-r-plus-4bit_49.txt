SUMMARY:
The New York Times and The Marshall Project conducted an investigation revealing unsafe conditions and scattershot testing within ICE detention centers, turning them into domestic and global spreaders of COVID-19. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, with social distancing being nearly impossible and protective gear almost nonexistent. Despite showing symptoms of COVID-19, Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was deported along with over 40,000 others since March. The investigation tracked over 750 domestic flights and 200 deportation flights, revealing ICE's role in spreading the virus. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees, with the Trump administration coercing them with promises of humanitarian aid. So far, 11 countries have confirmed COVID-positive deportees. ICE has defended its actions, citing precautions and CDC guidelines, but deportations continue with limited testing.
END OF SUMMARY.
