SUMMARY:
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. This has led to the deportation of over 40,000 immigrants, many of whom were sick with COVID-19. The conditions in ICE detention centers are described as "unsafe" and "cramped," with "scattershot" testing and a lack of protective gear, making it "near impossible" to practice social distancing. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept these sick deportees, with promises of humanitarian aid. As a result, countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted over 6,000 deportees, many of whom have tested positive for the virus upon arrival. This has sparked widespread fear and panic among immigrant detainees, who feel they are being sent to their deaths. END OF SUMMARY.
