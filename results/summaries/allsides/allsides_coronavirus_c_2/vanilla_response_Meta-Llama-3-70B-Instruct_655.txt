SUMMARY:

A New York Times investigation reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with at least 3,000 testing positive for the virus in detention centers. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible and protective gear scarce. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed that it has deported sick detainees, and 11 countries have reported receiving deportees with Covid-19. The agency claims to follow CDC guidelines, but continues to deport people without testing them all. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept deportees, promising humanitarian aid.
