SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the spread of the virus domestically and globally. Detainees describe crowded and unsanitary conditions in detention centers, with limited access to protective gear and social distancing measures. Despite confirmed COVID-19 cases among detainees, ICE has continued to transfer and deport immigrants, with over 750 domestic flights and 200 deportation flights since March. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees, with promises of humanitarian aid and ventilators from the Trump administration. At least 11 countries have confirmed COVID-19 cases among deportees returning from the United States. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but testing remains limited and deportation flights continue. This collaboration between The New York Times and The Marshall Project exposes the unsafe conditions and the potential consequences for public health due to ICE's actions during the pandemic.
