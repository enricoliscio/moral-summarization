Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it again to understand the main points.

The article is about ICE's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, who was sick with COVID-19 but was still deported. He was given Tylenol and sent back despite his symptoms. The article also talks about ICE's role in spreading the virus by moving and deporting people without proper testing or precautions.

I should highlight the moral issues here: ICE continuing deportations despite the pandemic, putting detainees and others at risk. The article mentions that over 40,000 immigrants were deported since March, and ICE has confirmed 3,000 positive cases. The conditions in detention centers are unsafe, with overcrowding and lack of protective gear.

Also, the article points out that ICE flights carried sick detainees, including Kanate, who was moved despite symptoms and later tested positive. Deportation flights to other countries, some with sick individuals, have contributed to global spread. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration, which praised them while sending ventilators.

ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but can only test a sample. The moral framing is about ICE's negligence and the human rights issues, putting vulnerable people in danger.

So, the summary should include key points: Admild's case, unsafe conditions, spread via ICE flights, countries accepting deportees under pressure, and ICE's response. Keep it under 200 words, concise, and highlight the moral issues.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how ICE's continued detention and deportation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated the spread of the virus, both domestically and internationally. Admild, an undocumented Haitian immigrant, was deported despite testing positive for COVID-19 and showing symptoms, receiving only Tylenol before being sent back. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, with ICE confirming at least 3,000 positive cases in detention centers. Detainees describe crowded, unsanitary conditions with little access to protective gear, making social distancing nearly impossible. ICE flights have transported thousands, including sick individuals, to other countries, contributing to the global spread. Despite criticism, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but lacks comprehensive testing. The article underscores the moral failings of deporting sick individuals, risking lives and public health. END OF SUMMARY.
