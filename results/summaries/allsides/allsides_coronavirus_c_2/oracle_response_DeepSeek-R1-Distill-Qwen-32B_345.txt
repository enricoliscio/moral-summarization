Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the words the author used to convey the moral aspects.

The article is about ICE continuing to deport undocumented immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was sick with COVID-19 but was still deported. The author uses words like "sick," "deport," "detain," "conditions," and "spread" to highlight the moral issues.

The article mentions that ICE has deported over 40,000 immigrants since March. Even with lockdowns, ICE continued their operations, which led to unsafe conditions and the spread of the virus. Immigrants were kept in cramped, unsanitary detention centers without proper protection. Some deportees tested positive after returning home, and ICE confirmed at least 3,000 positive cases among detainees. Despite limited testing, ICE kept moving and deporting people, including those showing symptoms.

The summary needs to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should focus on the actions of ICE, the conditions, the spread of the virus, and the consequences of their actions. Also, the pressure from the Trump administration to accept deportees is a key point.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Admild's case, then explain ICE's actions despite the pandemic, the conditions in detention centers, the spread to other countries, and ICE's response. Make sure to include the morally charged words and keep it under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how ICE continued to detain, move, and deport undocumented immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating unsafe conditions and spreading the virus. Admild, a sick Haitian immigrant, was deported despite testing positive for the virus and showing symptoms. Detainees described cramped, unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible. At least four deportees tested positive upon return to their home countries. ICE confirmed over 3,000 positive cases among detainees but limited testing. Despite these risks, ICE continued domestic flights, including those carrying sick individuals, and deported thousands, some ill, to other countries. Pressure from the Trump administration led nations like El Salvador and Honduras to accept deportees. ICE claimed to follow CDC guidelines but acknowledged limited testing. The agency's actions have contributed to the global spread of the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
