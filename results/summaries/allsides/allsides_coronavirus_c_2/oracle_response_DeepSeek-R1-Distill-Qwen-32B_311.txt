Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about ICE continuing to deport undocumented immigrants despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which is leading to the spread of the virus both domestically and internationally.

The author uses words like "sick," "deport," "detain," "spread," and "cramped" to highlight the moral issues. I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary. The key points are that ICE is moving and deporting people who are sick, leading to unsafe conditions and the spread of the virus. Countries are accepting these deportees under pressure from the Trump administration, even though some are ill.

I'll structure the summary to mention Admild's experience, the unsafe conditions in detention centers, the spread of the virus through ICE's actions, and the international impact. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while including the morally framed words.

Let me start by mentioning ICE's continued operations despite the pandemic. Then, talk about the unsafe conditions and how testing was limited. Include examples like Admild and Kanate. Mention the deportation flights and the pressure from the Trump administration. Finally, note that ICE claims to follow guidelines but continues the deportations.

I should make sure each sentence includes the moral framing words without making it sound forced. Also, ensure the summary is concise and covers all the main ethical issues presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has continued to detain, move, and deport undocumented immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite unsafe conditions and limited testing. Many detainees, including those showing symptoms of the virus, were crammed into unsanitary facilities where social distancing was impossible. For example, Admild, an undocumented Haitian, was deported while still sick, and Kanate, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, was moved despite Covid-19 symptoms. ICE's actions have turned detention centers into domestic and global spreaders of the virus, with at least 3,000 confirmed cases among detainees. Over 750 domestic flights and 200 international deportation flights carried thousands, some ill, to other countries. Despite pressure from the Trump administration, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but continues deportations, testing only a sampling of immigrants. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted thousands of deportees, including those returning with Covid-19. The article underscores the moral and public health consequences of ICE's operations during the pandemic.  
END OF SUMMARY.
