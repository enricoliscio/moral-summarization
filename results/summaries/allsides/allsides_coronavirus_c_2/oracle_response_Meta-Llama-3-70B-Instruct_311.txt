SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining, moving, and deporting immigrants despite the risks of spreading the coronavirus. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was deported back to his home country while still showing symptoms of COVID-19, after being given only Tylenol by a nurse. This is not an isolated incident, as an investigation reveals that ICE has continued to detain people in cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible. The agency has also been moving detainees from state to state, including those who are sick, and deporting them to other countries, putting pressure on these countries to accept them. At least 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees have been confirmed in ICE detention centers, and many more have been deported while ill. The Trump administration has been pushing for these deportations, even promising humanitarian aid to countries that cooperate. The morally reprehensible actions of ICE have turned the agency into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
