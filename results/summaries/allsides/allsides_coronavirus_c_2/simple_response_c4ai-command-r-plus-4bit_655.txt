SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has become a domestic and global spreader of COVID-19 by continuing to detain, transport, and deport immigrants during the pandemic, often under unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Despite limited testing, ICE has confirmed at least 3,000 coronavirus cases among detainees, and over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March. The investigation found that ICE moved detainees between detention centers, even those showing symptoms of COVID-19, and deported sick immigrants to their home countries, contributing to the spread of the virus. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have cooperated with deportations under pressure from the Trump administration and promises of humanitarian aid. As of last week, ICE admitted to still being unable to adequately test immigrants before deportation. The agency's actions and inactions have had deadly consequences, with at least 11 countries confirming COVID-19 cases among deportees returned from the United States. These revelations highlight the moral and ethical failures of ICE's response to the pandemic and the potential harm caused to vulnerable immigrant populations. END OF SUMMARY.
