SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has contributed to the spread of COVID-19 by continuing to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the pandemic. Despite unsafe conditions and limited testing in detention centers, ICE has moved detainees from state to state and deported over 40,000 immigrants since March. The investigation found that ICE's actions have had domestic and global implications, with at least 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees in ICE detention centers and deportees from 11 countries testing positive for COVID-19 upon their return. The article includes firsthand accounts from detainees who describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, and highlights how some countries have cooperated with deportations under pressure from the Trump administration. ICE has defended its actions by stating that it follows CDC guidelines and takes precautions, but deportation flights continue, even as the virus spreads.
