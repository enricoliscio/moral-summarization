SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining, moving, and deporting immigrants despite the risk of spreading the coronavirus. Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, was deported back to his home country despite still showing symptoms of COVID-19 after testing positive two weeks prior. He was given only Tylenol by a nurse at the airport before being sent back on a plane. This is not an isolated incident, as over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, with at least 3,000 testing positive for the virus in ICE detention centers. The conditions in these centers are cramped and unsanitary, making social distancing impossible. ICE has continued to move and deport sick detainees, putting them and others at risk of contracting the virus. The Trump administration has pressured countries to take in these sick deportees, with some countries accepting over 6,000 deportees since March. The morally reprehensible actions of ICE have turned the agency into a domestic and global spreader of the virus.

END OF SUMMARY.
