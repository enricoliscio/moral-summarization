SUMMARY:

A New York Times investigation reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them across states, and deport them. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with many reporting unsanitary and cramped detention centers where social distancing was impossible. At least 3,000 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and many have been deported to other countries while still sick. ICE has confirmed that deportees have returned to 11 countries with Covid-19. The agency claims to have taken precautions and followed CDC guidelines, but continues to deport sick detainees. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept deportees, with some countries cooperating in exchange for humanitarian aid.
