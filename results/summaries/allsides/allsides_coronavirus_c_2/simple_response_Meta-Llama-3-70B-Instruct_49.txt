SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE detention centers have become breeding grounds for the virus, with cramped and unsanitary conditions making social distancing impossible. At least 3,000 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and many have been deported to their home countries while still sick. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept these deportees, with some countries cooperating in exchange for humanitarian aid. This has led to the spread of the virus globally, with at least 11 countries confirming that deportees returned home with Covid-19. The moral imperative is clear: ICE's actions are reckless and irresponsible, putting lives at risk and exacerbating a global health crisis.
