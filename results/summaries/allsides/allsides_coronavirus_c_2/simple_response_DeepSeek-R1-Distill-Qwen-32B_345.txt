Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about ICE deporting undocumented immigrants, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions Admild, a Haitian immigrant, who was sick with COVID-19 but was still put on a deportation flight. The author seems critical of ICE's actions, highlighting how their policies contributed to spreading the virus both domestically and internationally. There are details about crowded detention centers, lack of protective gear, and how ICE continued deportations despite the health risks. The article also mentions that some countries accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration, even though some of them were sick.

I need to capture the moral issues here. The main points are: ICE's role in spreading COVID-19 through deportations, the unsafe conditions in detention centers, the forced return of sick individuals, and the pressure from the Trump administration on other countries to accept these deportees. The moral framing is that ICE's actions were unethical and harmful, putting vulnerable people at risk and exacerbating the pandemic.

Now, I should structure the summary to include these elements. Start with the collaboration between The New York Times and The Marshall Project, then mention Admild's case as an example. Highlight the unsafe conditions, the spread of the virus, and the role of the Trump administration. Also, note ICE's response and the ongoing deportations despite the risks.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clear. I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward, but still convey the criticism towards ICE's actions.

Let me draft the summary step by step. First, introduce the investigation and the main issue. Then, provide examples like Admild and Kanate. Mention the unsafe conditions in detention centers. Discuss the impact on other countries and the pressure from the Trump administration. Finally, note ICE's response and the continuation of deportations.

I should ensure that each sentence flows logically and covers all critical points without exceeding the word limit. Also, make sure to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary. Make sure the moral framing is evident throughout, emphasizing the unethical nature of ICE's actions during the pandemic.
