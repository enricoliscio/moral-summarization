SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. An investigation revealed that ICE detention centers were overcrowded and unsanitary, making social distancing impossible and putting detainees at risk of infection. At least 3,000 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and many have been deported to their home countries while still sick. This has led to the spread of the virus globally, with 11 countries confirming that deportees returned home with Covid-19. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept these deportees, even offering humanitarian aid in exchange. The moral implications of this are stark, as the US government has prioritized deportation over public health and human life.
