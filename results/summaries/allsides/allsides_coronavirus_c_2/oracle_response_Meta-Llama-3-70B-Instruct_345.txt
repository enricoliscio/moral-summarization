SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. This has led to the spread of the virus both domestically and globally. Many immigrant detainees have described cramped and unsanitary detention centers where social distancing was impossible and protective gear was almost nonexistent. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus-positive detainees in its detention centers, but testing has been limited. The Trump administration has pressured countries to take in sick deportees, with some countries accepting over 6,000 deportees since March. The morally reprehensible actions of ICE have put many lives at risk, and its continued deportation flights are a stark reminder of its role in spreading the virus.
