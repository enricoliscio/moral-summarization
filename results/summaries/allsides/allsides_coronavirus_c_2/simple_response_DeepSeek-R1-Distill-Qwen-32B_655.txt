Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, who was deported despite testing positive for COVID-19. He was given Tylenol and put on a plane. It mentions that ICE has deported over 40,000 immigrants since March, even during the pandemic. The New York Times investigation found that ICE's detention centers are unsafe, with crowded conditions and little protective gear, making them a virus spreader. They interviewed detainees who described these conditions as dangerous. Some deportees tested positive after arriving back in their countries. ICE has confirmed 3,000 positive cases but limited testing. They tracked flights carrying detainees, some sick, and deportation flights to other countries. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted many deportees under pressure from Trump, who promised aid. ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but still can't test everyone before deportation.

Now, the moral framing seems to highlight ICE's role in spreading the virus despite knowing the risks, the inhumane conditions, and the pressure from the Trump administration on other countries. The summary needs to capture these points succinctly.

I should structure it to first mention Admild's case, then the broader ICE actions, the unsafe conditions, the spread to other countries, and ICE's response. Keep it under 200 words, using the key points without going into too much detail.

Let me draft that.
