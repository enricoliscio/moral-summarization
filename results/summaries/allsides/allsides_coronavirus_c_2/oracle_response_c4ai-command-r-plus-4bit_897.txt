SUMMARY: ICE continues to detain immigrants, move them between states, and deport them amid lockdowns and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how unsafe conditions and inadequate testing have turned ICE into a domestic and global spreader of the virus. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, and at least four deportees from different countries tested positive shortly after arriving from the US. ICE has confirmed 3,000 coronavirus cases among detainees, but testing remains limited. More than 750 domestic flights and 200 deportation flights have been tracked, carrying sick migrants and putting them at risk. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted deportees under pressure and promises of aid from the Trump administration. Despite its role in spreading the virus, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and continues deportations with limited testing. This situation highlights the moral dilemma of prioritizing immigration control over public health, potentially endangering lives on a global scale.
