Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about ICE deporting undocumented immigrants, many of whom are sick with COVID-19. It mentions Admild, an undocumented immigrant from Haiti, who was sick and still deported. The author highlights that ICE continued detaining and deporting people even during the pandemic, which led to spreading the virus both domestically and internationally. There are statistics about the number of deportees, the unsafe conditions in detention centers, and how countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted deportees under pressure from the Trump administration. ICE claims they follow CDC guidelines but still only do limited testing.

The moral framing here is clear: the author is criticizing ICE's actions as inhumane and reckless, putting people's lives at risk during a pandemic. The tone is condemnatory, pointing out the ethical issues with deporting sick individuals and the potential global spread of the virus.

So, the summary needs to capture these points concisely, emphasizing the moral issues. I should include key details like the number of deportees, the unsafe conditions, the spread to other countries, and ICE's response. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's critical stance without adding my own opinions.

Let me structure it: start with the main issue (ICE deporting sick immigrants), mention the collaboration with NYT, the unsafe conditions, the spread, ICE's response, and the ethical concerns. Keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise but include all essential elements.

I should also mention specific examples like Admild and Kanate to illustrate the personal impact. Including the number of confirmed cases and the countries affected will add context. Ending with ICE's limited testing and ongoing deportations ties back to the moral issue.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to preserve the original's critical tone and all key points.

SUMMARY: A collaboration between The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how ICE's continued detention and deportation of immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the spread of the virus, both domestically and internationally. Despite unsafe conditions in overcrowded detention centers and limited testing, ICE has deported over 40,000 immigrants since March, including many showing COVID-19 symptoms. Admild, an undocumented Haitian, was deported while ill, and Kanate, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan, was moved despite exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. At least four deportees tested positive shortly after returning to their home countries. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but has only tested a limited number of detainees. The Trump administration pressured countries like El Salvador and Honduras to accept deportees, with some receiving humanitarian aid promises. ICE's actions have raised ethical concerns, as they risk spreading the virus globally while prioritizing deportations over public health. END OF SUMMARY.
