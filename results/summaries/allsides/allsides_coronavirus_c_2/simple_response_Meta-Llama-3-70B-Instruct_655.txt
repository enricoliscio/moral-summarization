SUMMARY:

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been criticized for its role in spreading the coronavirus globally. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain people, move them from state to state, and deport them, often without proper testing or precautions. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE detention centers have become breeding grounds for the virus, with cramped and unsanitary conditions, and a lack of protective gear. Detainees who tested positive for the virus were still deported to their home countries, putting entire communities at risk. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept these deportees, often with promises of humanitarian aid. At least 11 countries have confirmed that deportees returned home with Covid-19. ICE's actions have been deemed reckless and irresponsible, prioritizing deportation over public health and safety.
