SUMMARY: This investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how unsafe conditions and scattershot testing in ICE detention centers have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, both domestically and globally. Despite knowledge of the unsafe conditions, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, many of whom were symptomatic or had tested positive for the virus. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the United States since March, with at least four interviewees testing positive shortly after their arrival in their home countries. The investigation tracked hundreds of ICE flights, both domestic and for deportation purposes, that transported thousands of detainees, some sick with COVID-19. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted these deportees, with the Trump administration promising humanitarian aid and ventilators in return. ICE has defended its actions, claiming to have taken precautions and followed CDC guidelines. However, critics argue that the agency has played a significant role in spreading the virus, with limited testing and a disregard for the well-being of detainees and the wider public. END OF SUMMARY.
