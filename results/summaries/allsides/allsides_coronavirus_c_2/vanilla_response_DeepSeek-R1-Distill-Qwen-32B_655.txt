Okay, I need to summarize this news article about ICE's role in spreading COVID-19 through deportations. The article is quite detailed, so I'll start by identifying the main points. 

First, Admild's story is an example of someone deported despite showing symptoms. Then, the collaboration between The New York Times and The Marshall Project highlights unsafe conditions in detention centers and how ICE's actions spread the virus both domestically and internationally. 

I should mention the cramped detention centers, the lack of protective gear, and the fact that ICE continued moving people even when they were sick. The statistics are important too: over 40,000 deportations since March, 3,000 confirmed cases in ICE facilities, and 750 domestic flights moving detainees, some sick. 

Also, the international aspect is crucial. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras accepted thousands of deportees, some infected. The Trump administration's role in pressuring these countries is a key point. 

ICE's response is to say they followed CDC guidelines but still couldn't test everyone. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these elements without getting too bogged down in specifics. 

I'll structure it by starting with Admild's case, then move to the investigation findings, the conditions in detention centers, the spread via flights, international deportations, and end with ICE's response. That should cover all main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: A collaboration between The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals how ICE's detention and deportation practices have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, both domestically and internationally. Admild, an undocumented Haitian immigrant, was deported despite testing positive for the virus and showing symptoms. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported since March, with ICE continuing to detain and transport individuals despite health risks. Detention centers are described as cramped, unsanitary, and lacking protective gear, with detainees reporting near-impossible social distancing. At least four deportees tested positive for the virus shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed over 3,000 coronavirus cases in its facilities but has limited testing. The agency has operated 750 domestic flights and 200 international deportation flights, some carrying sick individuals. Countries like El Salvador and Honduras have accepted thousands of deportees under pressure from the Trump administration. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines but continues deportations despite health risks. END OF SUMMARY.
