SUMMARY: An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals that ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially spreading the virus domestically and globally. Despite unsafe conditions and limited testing in detention centers, ICE has moved thousands of detainees across the US and deported over 40,000 immigrants since March. Interviews with detainees describe cramped, unsanitary conditions with little protective gear. Some countries have accepted deportees, even those infected with COVID-19, due to pressure from the Trump administration and promises of aid. At least 11 countries have confirmed COVID-positive deportees returning home. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and take precautions, but continues deportations despite limited testing.
END OF SUMMARY.
