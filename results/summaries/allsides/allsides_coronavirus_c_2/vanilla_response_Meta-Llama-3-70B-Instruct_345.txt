SUMMARY:

A New York Times investigation reveals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a domestic and global spreader of the coronavirus. Despite lockdowns and measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ICE has continued to detain, move, and deport people, often without proper testing or safety precautions. Over 40,000 immigrants have been deported from the US since March, with at least 3,000 testing positive for the virus in detention centers. Detainees describe cramped and unsanitary conditions, making social distancing impossible. ICE has confirmed that deportees have arrived in their home countries with COVID-19, with at least 11 countries affected. The Trump administration has pressured countries to accept deportees, promising humanitarian aid. ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines, but continues to deport people without proper testing. Deportation flights continue, putting lives at risk.
