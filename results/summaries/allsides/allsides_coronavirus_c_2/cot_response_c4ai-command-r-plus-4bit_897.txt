SUMMARY:
Despite lockdowns and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, ICE has continued to detain, transfer, and deport immigrants, turning itself into a *domestic and global spreader* of the virus. An investigation by The New York Times and The Marshall Project reveals *unsafe conditions* and *scattershot testing* in ICE detention facilities, where social distancing and protective gear are almost non-existent. Immigrants describe cramped and unsanitary centers, with symptoms and positive tests often ignored. 

Since March, over 40,000 immigrants have been deported, with at least four testing positive shortly after arriving in their home countries. ICE has confirmed 3,000 COVID-19 cases among detainees, but testing remains limited. The investigation tracked hundreds of ICE flights moving detainees between centers, as well as deportation flights to other countries, risking the spread of the virus. 

Under *pressure* from the Trump administration, countries like El Salvador and Honduras have *accepted* and *cooperated* with deportations. In total, 11 countries have confirmed COVID-positive deportees. Despite criticism, ICE claims to follow CDC guidelines and only test a sampling of immigrants. The continuous deportation flights raise concerns about ICE's role in spreading the virus and the moral implications of their actions.
