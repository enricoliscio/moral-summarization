SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but instead want to contribute to the country. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, asking what would happen if a "Dreamer" was a science teacher or friendly neighbor. Obama claimed that the decision was not legally required, but a political and moral choice. He emphasized that DACA recipients are not to blame for their circumstances and should not be punished. Obama's statement was a rare instance of a former president criticizing a current president, despite precedent against doing so.
