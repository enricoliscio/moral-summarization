SUMMARY:
Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no *threat*" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us." He claimed that targeting these young people is "*wrong*" and "*self-defeating*" as they contribute to society and want to start businesses, serve in the military, and more. Obama also questioned the morality of sending these individuals back to countries they may not remember or speak the language. He emphasized that ending DACA is a "*political decision*" and a "*moral question*" rather than a legal requirement. Obama's response to Trump's action on DACA breaks the precedent of former presidents refraining from criticizing the current president. Obama had previously hinted that he would speak out if Trump took action against DACA.
