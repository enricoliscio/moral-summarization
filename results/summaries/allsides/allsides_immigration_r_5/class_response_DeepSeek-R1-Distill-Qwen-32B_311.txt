Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump's decision to end DACA. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. They provided a list of morally charged words: cruel, contrary, pose, Forgets, target, wrong, serve, cruel, threaten, helps.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is calling Trump's action cruel and against basic decency. He argues that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing positively to society. He uses examples like teachers and first responders. He also mentions it's a political decision, not a legal requirement, and questions where these young people would go.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, using "cruel" and "contrary." Then mention that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing. Use "target" when talking about Trump's decision. Highlight that it's wrong and threatens their future. Include examples of their roles like teachers or first responders, using "helps." Also, note that it's a political decision, not legal, and the moral question involved.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence includes the moral framing words where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects Obama's stance as described in the article.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and are "not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing their contributions to society as teachers, first responders, and military members. He questioned the morality of "targeting these young people," who are "here through no fault of their own," and warned that doing so is "wrong" and "self-defeating." Obama also noted that the decision is not legally required but a political choice, urging compassion for those who may not remember the countries they were sent to. He highlighted their role in society, such as being "that pitcher on our kidâ€™s softball team" or "that cadet in ROTC," and stressed that deporting them would not solve broader economic issues. END OF SUMMARY.
