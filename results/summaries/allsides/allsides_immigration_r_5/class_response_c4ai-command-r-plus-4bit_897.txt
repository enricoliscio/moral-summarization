SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "wrong" political decision that goes against America's spirit and common sense. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often called "Dreamers," pose no threat and are not taking away anything from Americans. Instead, they contribute to society and want to serve the country they call home. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, who are in the U.S. through no fault of their own, and the potential harm it could bring to their lives and the communities they are a part of. Obama believed that ending DACA was a self-defeating and unnecessary action that threatened the future of a group who are an integral part of the nation's fabric. He emphasized that deporting Dreamers would not bring any tangible benefits to Americans while highlighting the potential contributions of DACA recipients in various fields. Obama's stance on this issue goes beyond legalities and focuses on the moral implications of the decision, urging Americans not to forget the human cost involved.
