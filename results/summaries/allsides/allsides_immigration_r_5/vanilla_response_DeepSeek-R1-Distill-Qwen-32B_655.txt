Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump's decision to end DACA. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article starts by saying that Obama lashed out at Trump for ending the DACA program, which was on shaky legal ground. Obama called Trump "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He also mentioned that DACA recipients pose no threat and aren't taking anything away from others.

Obama wrote a Facebook post where he criticized the decision, saying it's wrong, self-defeating, and cruel. He gave examples like a science teacher or a neighbor being Dreamers, questioning where they'd be sent. He argued that the decision isn't legally required but a political one, and a moral question. He also pointed out that deporting them wouldn't solve issues like unemployment or taxes.

Additionally, the article notes that Obama had previously hinted he'd speak out if Trump acted on DACA, despite past presidents not usually criticizing current ones.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, his reasons, examples, and the political vs. legal angle. I should also mention his examples and the impact on the country. Finally, I'll note his earlier hint about speaking out.

Let me structure it: Obama criticizes Trump for ending DACA, calls it cruel and wrong, argues recipients are harmless and contribute positively. He questions where they'd go and says it's a political, not legal, decision. He uses examples like teachers and first responders. He also mentions it won't solve economic issues. Lastly, he had hinted at speaking out earlier despite precedents.

I think that covers all the key points. I'll make sure it's concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and helping their communities. He questioned the morality of deporting young people who grew up in the U.S. and wondered where they would be sent, emphasizing that the decision was politically motivated rather than legally required. Obama also highlighted that deporting Dreamers would not address issues like unemployment or taxes, and that they are integral members of society, such as teachers, first responders, and military cadets. He had previously hinted at speaking out on DACA despite the precedent against former presidents criticizing current ones. END OF SUMMARY.
