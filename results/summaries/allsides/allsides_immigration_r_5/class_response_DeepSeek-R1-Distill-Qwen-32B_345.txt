Alright, I need to help the user summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about former President Obama criticizing President Trump for ending the DACA program. Obama uses strong moral language, calling Trump's actions "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit." He emphasizes that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing positively to society. He also questions the political decision behind the rollback, suggesting it's unnecessary and harsh.

I need to identify the key morally framed words: cruel, contrary, pose, target, wrong, serve, threaten, helps. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

Next, I'll outline the main points to include in the summary:
1. Obama criticizes Trump for ending DACA.
2. Describes Trump's actions as cruel and lacking decency.
3. DACA recipients are innocent, pose no threat, and contribute to society.
4. Questions the necessity of the rollback, calling it a political and moral issue.
5. Highlights the impact on individuals who are part of the community.
6. Argues against the decision by pointing out the lack of benefits and the negative consequences.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure to use the moral words. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically.

I should start with Obama's criticism, mention the moral descriptors, explain why the recipients are innocent, and argue against the policy change. I'll end by summarizing the lack of benefit from the rollback and the moral implications.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral words are included without exceeding the word limit. I'll review it to make sure it's clear and accurately reflects the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit." He argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and are innocent individuals who contribute positively to society. Obama questioned the necessity of the rollback, stating it is a political decision and a moral issue. He emphasized that targeting these young people is wrong, as they are not responsible for their situation and are actively contributing to the country through their roles as teachers, first responders, and military cadets. Obama also highlighted the absurdity of deporting individuals who may not even speak the language of their birth country. He stressed that removing DACA recipients would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes but would instead harm the community. The former president's critique underscores the moral imperative to protect these individuals, who are integral to the fabric of American society. END OF SUMMARY.
