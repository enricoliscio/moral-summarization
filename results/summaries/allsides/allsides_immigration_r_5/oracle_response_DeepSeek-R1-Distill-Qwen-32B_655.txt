Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA, using strong moral language like "cruel" and "lacking basic decency."

I should make sure to include the key points: Obama's criticism, the reasons he gave (no threat, contribute to society), and the moral implications. Also, I need to use as many of the provided moral words as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

I'll start by identifying the main sections: Obama's accusations, his examples of DACA recipients' contributions, and his argument against the political and moral decision. I'll structure the summary to flow from his criticism to the consequences, using words like "target," "cruel," "serve," "love," etc.

I should also mention the optional legal aspect and the impact on individuals, like the science teacher example. Making sure the summary is concise but covers all the moral points the author emphasized.

Finally, I'll review to ensure all key moral terms are included and the summary stays within the word limit. I'll make sure it's clear, flows well, and accurately reflects Obama's stance as described in the article.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, serving in roles like teachers, first responders, and military cadets. He questioned the morality of deporting individuals who grew up in the U.S. and have no other country to call home. Obama emphasized that targeting these young people is "self-defeating," as they contribute to the economy and society, and accused the administration of making a political decision that threatens their future. He highlighted that DACA recipients are not taking anything away from others but are instead contributing to the country they love. Obama's critique underscored the moral obligation to protect these individuals, who have done nothing wrong and are integral to the community. END OF SUMMARY.
