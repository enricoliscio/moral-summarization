Okay, so I need to summarize the news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those words. 

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "cruel," "lacking," "basic decency," "contrary," "spirit," "common sense," "wrong," "nothing wrong," "self-defeating," "contribute," "wrong," "fault," "threat," "taking away," "clear," "required legally," "political decision," "moral question," "shouldn’t threaten," "future," "chance," "kicking out," "unemployment rate," "lighten," "taxes," "raise," "wages." I think these words are used to convey moral judgment.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, mention the morally framed words, and highlight the key points like DACA recipients posing no threat and contributing positively. I'll also include the rhetorical questions Obama posed and the political vs. moral aspect. Finally, I'll note that this is a significant move for a former president to criticize a current one.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me piece it together, ensuring all the key moral points are included without making it too lengthy.

**SUMMARY:**  
Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, such as serving in the military or starting businesses. Obama questioned the morality of deporting individuals who grew up in the U.S. and asked, "Where are we supposed to send her?" He emphasized that the decision was not legally required but a political choice with moral implications. Obama urged against threatening the future of these young people, who are innocent and contribute to the nation's progress. His critique highlights the moral and human cost of the decision, marking a significant move for a former president to openly oppose a sitting president.
