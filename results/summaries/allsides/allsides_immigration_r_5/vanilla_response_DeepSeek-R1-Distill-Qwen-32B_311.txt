Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump's decision to end DACA. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Obama lashed out at Trump for ending the DACA program, which was on shaky legal ground. Obama called Trump's actions "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and aren't taking anything away from others. 

He wrote a lengthy Facebook post after Jeff Sessions announced the rollback. Obama questions where these young people would go, suggesting they might not even remember their home country. He emphasizes that this is a political decision, not a legal requirement, and a moral issue. 

He also points out that DACA recipients contribute positively, like being teachers, neighbors, or serving in the military. Obama claims deporting them wouldn't help the economy and criticizes the decision as self-defeating. He mentions that this group didn't choose to come here and shouldn't be punished.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely. I should mention Obama's criticism, the terms he used, the impact on DACA recipients, the political vs. legal aspect, and his argument about their contributions and the moral implications.

Let me structure this: Start with Obama criticizing Trump, the reasons he gave, the consequences of ending DACA, and his moral stance. Keep it under 200 words.

I should also include that Obama had previously hinted he would speak out if Trump acted on DACA, despite past precedents.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically from his criticism to the reasons behind it, the moral and political angles, and the potential impact on the recipients.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, such as serving as teachers, first responders, and military members. He questioned the morality of deporting them to countries they may not remember, emphasizing that the decision was politically motivated rather than legally required. Obama also highlighted that targeting these young individuals would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes. He stressed that Dreamers, who came to the U.S. through no fault of their own, should not be punished. This criticism came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the rollback of the program, and Obama had previously indicated he would speak out if Trump acted on DACA. END OF SUMMARY.
