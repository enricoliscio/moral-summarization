Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read through the article to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Obama's criticism of Trump for ending DACA, which was on shaky legal ground. Obama called Trump "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argued that DACA recipients are harmless and contribute positively to society. There's a part where Obama questions where these young people would go if deported, highlighting the moral dilemma.

I also notice that Obama emphasizes that this decision isn't legally required but a political choice. He uses examples like teachers, neighbors, and community helpers to illustrate the impact. He also points out that deporting them won't solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words and to include the moral framing. I need to make sure I capture Obama's strong moral stance, the impact on individuals, and the political vs. legal aspect.

I should structure the summary to first mention Obama's criticism, then his moral arguments, the examples he uses, and the political nature of the decision. Keeping it concise but covering all key points.

Let me draft a summary that includes all these elements, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral angle effectively.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, serving as teachers, first responders, and military personnel. He questioned the morality of deporting young people who have lived in the U.S. for years, asking where they would go and whether they would be sent to countries they no longer know. Obama emphasized that the decision was not legally required but a political choice, urging compassion and recognizing the contributions of these individuals to the nation. He also highlighted that deporting them would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes. END OF SUMMARY.
