SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" move that goes against "common sense" and "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, are not a threat and have done nothing wrong. He emphasized that they contribute to society and want to give back to the country they call home. Obama called the decision a "political" and "moral question," suggesting that it was unnecessary and would not lower unemployment, lighten taxes, or raise wages. Obama's comments come as the Trump administration plans to phase out the amnesty program, which protected young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation. Obama had previously hinted that he would speak out if Trump took action on DACA, despite the longstanding precedent of former presidents refraining from criticizing their successors. END OF SUMMARY.
