SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us", emphasizing that they are willing to "serve" and "contribute" to the country. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, asking "What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her?" Obama framed the decision as a "moral question", stating that it's not required legally, but rather a political choice that "threatens" the future of innocent individuals. He emphasized that kicking them out won't have any economic benefits, and instead, it's a "self-defeating" move. Obama's post served as a passionate plea to reconsider the decision and show compassion to those who were brought to the US through no fault of their own.
