SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, calling it "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they are innocent and contribute to the country. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, asking "What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her?" Obama framed the decision as a "moral question," stating that it is wrong to threaten the future of these young people who are here through no fault of their own. He highlighted their positive contributions, such as serving in the military, staffing labs, and starting new businesses. Obama's critique was rooted in a sense of moral decency, urging that we should not "target" or "threaten" these individuals who are an integral part of our communities.
