Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA, calling it cruel and against the spirit of the country. He emphasizes that DACA recipients are innocent and contribute positively.

I should identify the key moral arguments Obama makes. He talks about the young people's innocence, their contributions, and the unfairness of deporting them. Also, he mentions it's a political decision, not a legal requirement.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, then mention his reasons: cruelty, lack of threat, and their contributions. I'll include his rhetorical questions about deportation and the nature of the decision as political and moral. Finally, I'll note his previous hint about weighing in on DACA.

I have to ensure the summary is concise but covers all moral points. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the criticism, then the reasons, followed by the implications, and ending with his stance.

Let me draft it, making sure to stay within the word limit and maintain the moral framing as presented.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, serving in roles such as teachers, first responders, and military cadets. He questioned the morality of deporting these individuals, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for years and may not even speak the language of their birth country. Obama emphasized that the decision was not legally required but a political choice, urging compassion and fairness toward a group that did not choose their immigration status. He also highlighted that removing these young people would not solve broader economic issues like unemployment or taxes. The former president's comments reflect a moral stance against targeting innocent individuals and upholding the values of empathy and inclusivity. END OF SUMMARY.
