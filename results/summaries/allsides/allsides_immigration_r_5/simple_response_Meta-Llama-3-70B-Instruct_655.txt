SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers", pose no threat to the country and are not taking anything away from others. He emphasized that these young people want to contribute to the country, starting businesses, serving in the military, and working in labs. Obama questioned the morality of targeting these individuals, asking what would happen if a science teacher or friendly neighbor was a Dreamer. He stressed that the decision was political, not legally required, and that it's wrong to threaten the future of these young people who are in the US through no fault of their own.

END OF SUMMARY.
