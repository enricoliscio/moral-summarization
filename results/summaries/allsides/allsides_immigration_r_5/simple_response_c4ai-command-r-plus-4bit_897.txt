SUMMARY: Former President Obama condemns President Trump's decision to end the DACA program as morally reprehensible and lacking basic decency. Obama emphasizes that DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He argues that targeting them is wrong, self-defeating, and cruel. Obama highlights the potential contributions of Dreamers, such as starting businesses, serving in the military, and staffing labs, and questions the logic of deporting them. He frames the issue as a moral question, appealing to Americans' sense of common sense and compassion. Obama's statement stands in stark contrast to the current administration's stance, highlighting the ethical and humanitarian implications of ending the DACA program.
