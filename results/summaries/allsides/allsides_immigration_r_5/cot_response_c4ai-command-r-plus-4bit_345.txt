SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" move that goes against "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, pose no threat and are not taking away opportunities from others. Instead, they contribute to society and want to give back to the country they call home. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, who are here through no fault of their own, and asked if it was right to send them back to a country they might not even remember. Obama also highlighted the potential impact on communities and the economy, stating that ending DACA won't lower unemployment, lighten taxes, or raise wages. He saw his intervention as justified because of the moral implications of the decision. Obama's statement, posted on Facebook, came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the gradual rollback of the amnesty program, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.
