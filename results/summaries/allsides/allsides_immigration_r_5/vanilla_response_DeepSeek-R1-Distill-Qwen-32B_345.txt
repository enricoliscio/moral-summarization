Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand all the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Obama lashed out at Trump for ending the DACA program, which was on shaky legal ground. He called Trump "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and aren't taking anything from others. Obama wrote a Facebook post where he emphasized that targeting these young people is wrong because they did nothing wrong, and they contribute positively to society by starting businesses, serving in the military, etc. He questioned where they would be sent, suggesting it's not feasible to send them to a country they don't know.

He also pointed out that ending DACA isn't legally required, it's a political decision, and a moral issue. He mentioned that these young people are part of everyday life, like teachers or first responders, and deporting them wouldn't solve economic issues. The article also notes that Obama had previously hinted he would speak out if Trump acted on DACA, despite past presidents not usually criticizing current ones.

So, to summarize, I need to include the main points: Obama's criticism of Trump, the reasons he gave (cruelty, moral issue, contributions to society), the legal aspect, and the personal examples he used. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I should start with the main action: Obama criticizing Trump. Then mention the DACA program and why it was controversial. Highlight Obama's arguments about the moral aspect and the impact on society. Maybe include the examples he gave to illustrate his point. Also, note that this was a political decision, not a legal requirement. Finally, mention that Obama had hinted he would speak out despite precedents.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points without getting too detailed. Let me piece it together step by step.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society through their roles in business, science, and public service. He emphasized that deporting them would not address economic issues and questioned the feasibility of sending them to unfamiliar countries. Obama noted that ending DACA was a political decision, not a legal requirement, and urged compassion, highlighting that these individuals are integral parts of communities, such as teachers and first responders. This marked Obama's public stance against Trump on immigration, despite precedents against former presidents criticizing current ones. END OF SUMMARY.
