SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the DACA amnesty program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers", pose no threat to the country and are not taking anything away from others. He emphasized that they are contributing members of society, wanting to start businesses, serve in the military, and otherwise contribute to the country. Obama questioned the moral implications of targeting these young people, who are in the US through no fault of their own, and asked where they would be sent if deported. He claimed that the decision was a political choice, not a legal requirement, and that it would not benefit the country in any way. Obama's strong moral stance emphasizes the importance of treating these young people with compassion and respect.
