Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They also provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is calling Trump's decision cruel and against common sense. He argues that DACA recipients are not a threat and contribute positively to society. The author used words like "cruel," "contrary," "pose," "target," "wrong," "serve," "threaten," and "helps."

I need to make sure my summary includes these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning Obama's criticism, using "cruel" and "contrary." Then, I'll note that DACA recipients pose no threat and are being targeted unfairly. I should include how they contribute to the country, using "serve" in contexts like military or community service.

I also need to mention that Trump's action isn't legally required, making it a political and moral decision. Highlighting that threatening these young people is wrong and against common sense is important. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating all the key moral points.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others. He emphasized that targeting these young people is wrong, as they contribute to society by starting businesses, serving in the military, and helping their communities. Obama questioned the morality of deporting individuals who may not even remember their country of origin, stating that such actions are self-defeating and not legally required. He urged that while Americans may have concerns about immigration, threatening the future of these young people is not the solution. Obama highlighted their roles as teachers, neighbors, and community helpers, arguing that deporting them would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes. He concluded that this decision is a political and moral question, urging compassion and fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
