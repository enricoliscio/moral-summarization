SUMMARY:
Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the DACA amnesty program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they are innocent and want to contribute to the country. He claimed that targeting these young people is "wrong" and "self-defeating," as they want to start businesses, serve in the military, and otherwise contribute to the country. Obama framed the decision as a "moral question," urging that Americans should not "threaten the future" of these young people who are here through no fault of their own. He concluded that kicking them out won't benefit the country in any way, and that it's a purely political decision. END OF SUMMARY.
