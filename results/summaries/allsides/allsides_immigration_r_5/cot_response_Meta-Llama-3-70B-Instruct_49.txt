SUMMARY:
Former President Obama lashed out at President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program, calling the move "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us." He claimed that targeting these young people is "wrong" because they have done nothing wrong and want to contribute to the country. Obama wrote that the decision is a "moral question" and that kicking them out won't lower the unemployment rate or raise anybody's wages. He emphasized that these individuals are an integral part of the community, serving as science teachers, first responders, and cadets in ROTC. Obama's strong stance against the decision reflects his commitment to protecting the future of these young people who are in the country through no fault of their own. END OF SUMMARY.
