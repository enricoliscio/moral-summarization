SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit, and to common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, staffing labs, serving in the military, and more. He questioned the moral implications of targeting these young people, asking "What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her?" Obama framed the decision as a "moral question," stating that it's not required legally, but a political choice that threatens the future of innocent young people who are here through no fault of their own. He emphasized that kicking them out won't benefit the economy or citizens, but rather, it's a cruel and wrong move.
