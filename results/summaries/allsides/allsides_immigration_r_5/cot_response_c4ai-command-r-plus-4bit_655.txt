SUMMARY:
Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" act that goes against our "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no *threat*" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us." He emphasized that their presence is beneficial to our communities and that they "are not *at fault*" for their situation. Obama believes that kicking them out will not bring any tangible benefits to Americans while tearing apart families and communities. Obama's statement highlights the moral dilemma of the DACA rollback, appealing to our sense of common good and humanity. He urges us to consider the potential contributions of these young people and the potential loss we face by sending them away. Obama's intervention raises the ethical stakes of this political decision, reminding us of the human cost involved.
