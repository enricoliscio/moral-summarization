Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. I need to make sure I capture the main points. First, I should identify who is involved: Obama and Trump. The program in question is DACA, which was established under Obama, so that's important context.

The article mentions that Obama called Trump's decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." I should note the adjectives he used because they highlight the emotional stance. Also, he argues that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing positively to society, which is a key argument against ending the program.

I should also mention the political and moral aspects. Obama points out that ending DACA isn't legally required, so it's a political move. He's emphasizing the moral responsibility here. Additionally, he uses examples like teachers, neighbors, and community helpers to illustrate the impact on everyday people.

The user specified that the summary should be under 200 words and include a specific token structure. I need to ensure it's concise but covers all main points: Obama's criticism, the nature of DACA recipients, the political vs. legal angle, and the personal examples he uses.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, since the user provided an example response, I can use that as a reference to ensure I'm on the right track. I'll structure it with the key points, making sure each sentence adds value without being redundant.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and are contributing positively to society by starting businesses, serving in the military, and helping their communities. He questioned the morality of deporting young people who were brought to the U.S. as children, asking where they would be sent, often to countries they no longer know. Obama emphasized that ending DACA is a political choice, not a legal requirement, and urged not to threaten the future of these young people, who are integral to the nation's progress. He highlighted their roles as teachers, neighbors, and community members, arguing that deporting them would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes. Obama's comments reflect his longstanding opposition to Trump's immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
