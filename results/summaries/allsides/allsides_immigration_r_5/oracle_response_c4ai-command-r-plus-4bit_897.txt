SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel," "self-defeating," and "wrong" political decision. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He emphasized their potential as business owners, scientists, first responders, and members of the military. Obama questioned the morality of "targeting" these young people, who are "through no fault of their own," and claimed that deporting them would not benefit Americans but rather "threaten" the country's future. He also highlighted the potential harm caused by sending these individuals to countries they may not remember or speak the language of. Obama's comments came despite the precedent of former presidents refraining from criticizing the current president.
END OF SUMMARY.
