SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, which protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Obama's response highlighted the moral implications of the decision, calling it "cruel" and "self-defeating." He emphasized that DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. Obama argued that the decision to target these individuals is wrong and goes against American values of decency and common sense. He also questioned the logic behind the decision, stating that it will not improve economic or social conditions for Americans. Obama's stance on DACA reflects his belief in the importance of giving back to the country and serving those who need protection.
