Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA, using strong moral language.

The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words first. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "cruel," "lacking basic decency," "contrary," "wrong," "self-defeating," "cruelty," "threat," "pose no threat," "self-defeating," "morality," "shouldn't threaten," "chance," "opportunity," "contribution," "unfair," "wrong," "self-defeating," and "cruel." I'll list each of these with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism of Trump, using the identified moral terms. I'll mention the DACA recipients as Dreamers, highlight their positive contributions, and the moral implications of Trump's decision. I'll also touch on Obama's points about the legal and political nature of the decision and the potential consequences of deporting these individuals.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first introduce the criticism, then the moral arguments, and finally the implications. I'll also keep the tone consistent with the original article's framing, emphasizing the moral and emotional aspects.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all the key moral points are included. I'll make sure the summary accurately reflects Obama's stance and the moral language used, providing a clear and concise overview of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, or "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, serving as teachers, first responders, and military members. He questioned the morality of deporting individuals who have done nothing wrong and emphasized that the decision was not legally required but a political choice. Obama highlighted the unfairness of targeting these young people, who were brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own, and stressed that deporting them would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes. He urged compassion and unity, urging the nation to consider the human cost of such a decision.
