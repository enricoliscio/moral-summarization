Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about former President Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. Obama uses strong moral language, so I need to identify those words. Words like "cruel," "basic decency," "contrary," "wrong," "self-defeating," "threat," "pose no threat," "morally wrong," "self-defeating," "contribute," "cruel," "threaten," "fault," "pose no threat,"
