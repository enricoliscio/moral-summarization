SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "political decision" and a "moral question." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, "pose no threat" and have done nothing wrong. He emphasized their positive contributions to society and the cruelty of uprooting them from the only country they know. Obama claimed that targeting these young people is "self-defeating" and contrary to our spirit and common sense. He questioned the logic behind the decision, suggesting that it would not benefit Americans in any tangible way. Obama's statement highlighted the human cost of the policy change, appealing to Americans' sense of decency and compassion. The decision to end DACA, which was implemented to protect those brought to the country illegally as children, has sparked widespread debate and concern.
