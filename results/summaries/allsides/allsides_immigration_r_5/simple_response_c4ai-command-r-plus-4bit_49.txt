SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, which protected young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation. Obama's criticism focused on the moral implications of the decision, calling it "cruel" and "self-defeating." He emphasized that DACA recipients are contributing members of society who pose no threat and are not taking away opportunities from others. Obama argued that the decision was not legally required but rather a political and moral choice. He highlighted the potential contributions of DACA recipients and the negative impact of uprooting them from the only country they know. Obama's stance emphasized the moral responsibility to protect these young people, regardless of broader concerns about immigration.
