SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" move. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and are not a threat to the country. He also questioned the morality of sending these young people back to countries they may barely remember. Obama's statement came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration's plan to phase out the program, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation. Obama defended the Dreamers, saying they are not taking anything away from Americans and that ending DACA is a political decision, not a legal requirement. He also noted that Dreamers want to contribute to the country and serve in various capacities, from teachers to military personnel. Obama's comments reflect his stance on immigration and his support for Dreamers, even after leaving office. END OF SUMMARY.
