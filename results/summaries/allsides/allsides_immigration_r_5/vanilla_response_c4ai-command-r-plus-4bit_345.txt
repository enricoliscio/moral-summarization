SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision cruel and lacking basic decency. Obama defended DACA recipients, arguing that they pose no threat and are not taking away anything from other Americans. He claimed that the decision to end the program was politically motivated and morally wrong. Obama also emphasized the contributions that DACA recipients could make to American society and questioned the logic behind sending them back to countries they may barely remember. He highlighted the potential impact on individuals, such as teachers, neighbors, and first responders, who have established lives and contributed to their communities in the US. Obama concluded by stating that ending DACA would not positively impact unemployment, taxes, or wages in the country. This criticism came despite the precedent of former presidents typically refraining from openly criticizing the current president.
