SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision cruel and lacking basic decency. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He questioned the morality of the decision and suggested that it was politically motivated. Obama also emphasized that Dreamers are integrated into American communities and contribute to the country's success. He claimed that deporting them would not benefit American citizens and that the decision goes against American values. Obama had previously suggested that he would speak out if Trump took action against DACA, despite the tradition of former presidents refraining from criticizing their successors.
