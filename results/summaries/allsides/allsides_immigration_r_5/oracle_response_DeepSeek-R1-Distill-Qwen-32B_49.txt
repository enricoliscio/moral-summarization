Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. The article is about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. 

First, I should identify the key points: Obama calls Trump's action "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argues DACA recipients are harmless and contribute positively. He uses terms like "self-defeating," "serve," and "love." 

I need to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll start by noting that Obama criticizes Trump for ending DACA, using words like "cruel" and "lacking." He emphasizes that DACA recipients pose no threat and contribute to society, using "serve" and "love." 

I should mention the political vs. legal aspect, using "action" and "decision." Also, highlight Obama's rhetorical questions about sending them back, using "send." I'll include how DACA recipients are part of communities, using "helps" and "wear." 

Finally, I'll note Obama's previous promise to speak out, using "gave" and "kicking." I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure this into a concise summary.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the action "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and contribute positively to society, serving in roles like teachers, first responders, and military cadets. He questioned the morality of deporting individuals who have lived in the U.S. for years, asking where they would be sent, to a country they may not even remember. Obama emphasized that the decision was political, not legally required, and urged compassion, stating that targeting these young people is self-defeating and undermines the nation's spirit. He highlighted their contributions, such as starting businesses and serving in the military, and warned that deporting them would not solve economic issues but would harm the country's future. Obama's comments reflect his moral stance on immigration, urging a humane approach. END OF SUMMARY.
