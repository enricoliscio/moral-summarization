SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as morally and legally wrong. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often known as "Dreamers," contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He emphasized their potential as future business owners, scientists, and military personnel. Obama condemned the decision as cruel and lacking basic decency, appealing to Americans' sense of common good and empathy. He questioned the rationale behind targeting these young people, who are only seeking opportunities to thrive and contribute to the nation. Obama's statement challenged the notion that deporting Dreamers would bring economic benefits, highlighting that it is a political and moral choice, not a legal requirement. The former president's stance aligns with his previous hints at speaking out against any actions taken by Trump that threaten the well-being and future of DACA recipients.
