Okay, so I need to summarize this news article where former President Obama criticizes President Trump for ending the DACA program. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Obama lashed out at Trump for ending DACA, which was on shaky legal ground. He called Trump "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argues that DACA recipients pose no threat and aren't taking anything from others. Obama wrote a Facebook post after Jeff Sessions announced the rollback. He questions where these young people would go, suggesting it's a political and moral decision, not legally required. He also mentions that deporting them won't solve economic issues and gives examples of their contributions, like being teachers or first responders.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points: Obama's criticism, the moral and political nature of the decision, the impact on individuals, and the argument against the necessity of the action. I should keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Obama's criticism, then his arguments about the moral and political aspects, followed by the examples of DACA recipients' contributions, and conclude with his assertion that ending DACA doesn't solve problems. I'll make sure to include the emotional language he used, like "cruel" and "self-defeating," to preserve the moral framing.

Let me draft that. I'll start with Obama criticizing Trump, mention the DACA recipients' innocence and contributions, the political vs. legal angle, and end with the consequences of deporting them. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise and within the limit.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama harshly criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and have contributed positively to society, serving as teachers, first responders, and military members. He questioned the morality of deporting individuals who have lived in the U.S. for years, emphasizing that it is a political choice, not a legal requirement. Obama also highlighted that targeting these young people would not solve economic issues like unemployment or taxes but would harm the country by losing their contributions. He urged compassion and fairness, noting that Dreamers are part of American communities and should not be forced to leave a country they call home. END OF SUMMARY.
