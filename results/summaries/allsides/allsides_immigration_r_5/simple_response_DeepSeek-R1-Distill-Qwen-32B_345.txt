Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article again to get the main points.

First, Obama is criticizing Trump for ending DACA, calling him cruel and lacking basic decency. He mentions that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing positively to society. There's also a moral argument against deporting them because they're innocent and have been part of the community. He uses examples like teachers, neighbors, and military cadets to emphasize their positive roles.

I should make sure to include the key points: Obama's criticism, the moral stance, the contributions of DACA recipients, and the unnecessary nature of Trump's decision. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me structure it: start with Obama's criticism, mention the moral and political decision, highlight the contributions, and end with the unnecessary nature of the action. That should cover the main points without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama harshly criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and are integral contributors to society, working in fields like education, emergency services, and the military. He emphasized that deporting them would not solve economic or social issues but would instead harm the country's spirit and common sense. Obama questioned the morality of targeting these young individuals, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for years and may not even remember their country of origin. He stressed that this decision was not legally required but a political choice with moral implications. Obama also highlighted the positive roles Dreamers play in communities, such as being teachers, first responders, and military cadets, and urged against threatening their future. END OF SUMMARY.
