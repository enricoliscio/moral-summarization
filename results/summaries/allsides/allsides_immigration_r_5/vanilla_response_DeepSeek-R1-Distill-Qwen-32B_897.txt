Alright, I need to summarize this article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says Obama called Trump's decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He argues that DACA recipients, the Dreamers, pose no threat and contribute positively to the country. Obama mentions their roles in various fields like education, military, and community services. He also questions the morality of deporting them to countries they don't know. He emphasizes that this decision isn't legally required but is a political choice. He urges not to threaten the future of these young people who are here through no fault of their own.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, mention the reasons he gave, and highlight the political vs. legal aspect. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed. Keep it concise and clear.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
