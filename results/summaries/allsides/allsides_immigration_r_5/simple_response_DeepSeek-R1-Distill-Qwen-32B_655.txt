Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. I should focus on the key points: Obama's criticism, the reasons he gave, and the moral arguments he made.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Obama called Trump's decision cruel and lacking basic decency. He argued that DACA recipients are innocent and contribute positively to society. He also pointed out that the decision wasn't legally required but was a political and moral choice.

I should make sure the summary includes Obama's strong language, the moral implications, and the examples he used, like the science teacher or the softball pitcher. It's important to highlight that Obama emphasized the Dreamers' innocence and their contributions.

I also need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the essence of the original text. I'll structure it by stating Obama's criticism, his moral arguments, and the consequences of Trump's decision. I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language straightforward.

Let me draft the summary: Start with Obama criticizing Trump, mention the DACA program, the moral and political choice aspect, the examples of Dreamers' roles in society, and the impact of the decision. Make sure it flows logically and covers all key points without being too lengthy.

I should also check that I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the article's content and the moral framing provided by the author. That way, the summary remains accurate and stays true to the original text's perspective.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, known as "Dreamers," are innocent individuals who pose no threat and have contributed positively to society, serving as teachers, first responders, and military personnel. He questioned the morality of deporting them to countries they may not even remember, emphasizing that their removal would not solve broader economic issues. Obama also noted that the decision was not legally required but a political choice, urging compassion and fairness for those who arrived in the U.S. through no fault of their own. His comments reflect a moral stance against targeting vulnerable individuals and highlight the societal benefits of their presence. END OF SUMMARY.
