SUMMARY:
Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision *cruel* and *lacking in basic decency*. Obama argued that the move was *wrong* and *self-defeating*, as DACA recipients are not a threat and are contributing to American society. He emphasized that these young people, often referred to as *Dreamers*, are an integral part of communities, serving as teachers, neighbors, and first responders. Obama claimed that the decision to end DACA was a *political* and *moral* choice, and *wrongfully threatened the future of a group of innocent individuals*. He highlighted that ending the program would not bring any tangible benefits to Americans, such as lower unemployment or higher wages. Obama's statement came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the gradual rollback of the amnesty program, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. Obama had previously suggested that he would voice his opinion if Trump took action on DACA, despite the tradition of former presidents refraining from criticizing their successors.
