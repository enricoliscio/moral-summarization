SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they want to "serve" and "contribute" to the country. He framed the decision as a "moral question," stating that it's "wrong" to "target" these young people who have done nothing wrong. Obama questioned the logic of sending them back to a country they may not know or remember, asking "Where are we supposed to send her?" He emphasized that this decision is a "political" choice, not a legal requirement, and that it will not benefit the country in any way, but rather "kick" out valuable members of society. Obama's post highlighted the moral implications of this decision, urging Americans to consider the human cost of this "self-defeating" action.
