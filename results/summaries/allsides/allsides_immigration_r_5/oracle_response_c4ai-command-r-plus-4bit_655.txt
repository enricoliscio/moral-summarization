SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Obama called the decision "cruel" and lacking in "basic decency," arguing that it goes against American values and common sense. He emphasized that DACA recipients contribute positively to society and pose no threat. Obama also questioned the morality of targeting these individuals, who came to the country through no fault of their own and want to serve their communities and the country they love. He highlighted the potential contributions of DACA recipients and the negative consequences of "kicking them out." Obama's comments come despite the precedent of former presidents typically refraining from criticizing the current president.
END OF SUMMARY.
