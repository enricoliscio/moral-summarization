SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat, have done nothing wrong, and want to contribute to the country. He emphasized that the decision is a moral question, not a legal requirement, and that it's wrong to target these young people who are here through no fault of their own. Obama also highlighted the human impact, asking what would happen if a Dreamer was a science teacher, neighbor, or first responder. He concluded that kicking them out won't improve the economy or benefit anyone, but would only cause harm.

END OF SUMMARY.
