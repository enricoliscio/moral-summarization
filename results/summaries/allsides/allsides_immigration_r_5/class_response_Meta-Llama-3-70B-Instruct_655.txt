SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us", emphasizing that they want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and more. He deemed it "wrong" to target these young people, who have done nothing wrong, and warned that it would be "self-defeating" for the country. Obama questioned the morality of the decision, asking where we would send a Dreamer who is a science teacher or friendly neighbor, and emphasized that it's a "moral question" rather than a legal requirement. He concluded that kicking out DACA recipients won't improve unemployment rates, taxes, or wages, and that it's a political decision that "threatens the future" of these young people.
