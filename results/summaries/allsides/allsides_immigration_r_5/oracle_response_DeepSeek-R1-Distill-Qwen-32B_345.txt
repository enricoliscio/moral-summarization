Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama criticizing Trump's decision to end DACA. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, so I should focus on the words the author used that have a moral connotation. Let me read through the article again to make sure I catch all the key points.

The article starts by saying Obama lashed out at Trump for ending DACA, which was on shaky legal ground. He called Trump "cruel" and lacking "basic decency," which are strong moral terms. He also said Trump acted contrary to the spirit and common sense, which ties into the moral framing. 

Obama argues that DACA recipients pose no threat and aren't taking anything from others. He uses words like "target" and "self-defeating" to describe Trump's action. He emphasizes that these young people contribute positively, mentioning starting businesses, labs, military service, and contributing to the country. 

He also uses emotional appeals, like the example of a science teacher or neighbor who might be a Dreamer, asking where they would be sent. He argues that this action isn't legally required but is a political and moral decision. He mentions that these individuals aren't a threat and aren't taking away opportunities, using words like "threaten" and "helps."

Obama also lists examples of their contributions, like being a softball pitcher, first responder, or ROTC cadet, and points out that deporting them doesn't solve economic issues. He ends by noting he had hinted at weighing in if Trump acted on DACA, despite precedents against former presidents criticizing current ones.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I should structure it to highlight Obama's criticism, the moral terms used, and the emotional appeal. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, then his moral arguments, followed by the emotional examples and the political vs. legal angle. Finally, I'll mention his prior hint about speaking out.

Let me draft that, making sure to include words like "cruel," "lacking," "target," "self-defeating," "serve," "love," "send," "action," "decision," "threaten," "helps," "wear," "gave," "kicking." I'll need to weave these into the summary naturally.

Wait, I should also ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too wordy. Maybe start with the main action, then the moral arguments, emotional appeal, and conclusion about the political decision. That should cover all the necessary elements while preserving the moral framing.
