SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected young immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation. Obama called the decision "cruel" and "self-defeating," lacking basic decency and contrary to American values. He emphasized that DACA recipients pose no threat and are contributing positively to the country. Obama argued that ending DACA is a political decision, not a legal requirement, and that it threatens the future of hardworking, law-abiding individuals who only want to serve and contribute to the country they love. He questioned the morality of "kicking out" these individuals, emphasizing that it would not benefit Americans but instead would harm our communities and our country. Obama's statement highlighted the human cost of ending DACA and the potential loss of talented, ambitious individuals who are integral members of our society.
