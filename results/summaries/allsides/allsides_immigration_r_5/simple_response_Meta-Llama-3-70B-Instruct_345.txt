SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but instead want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and more. He emphasized that the decision is a political choice, not a legal requirement, and that it is morally wrong to threaten the future of these young people who are in the US through no fault of their own. Obama also highlighted the human impact of the decision, asking what would happen to a science teacher or friendly neighbor who is a Dreamer. He concluded that kicking out DACA recipients would not benefit the economy or society, but would only cause harm to innocent individuals.
