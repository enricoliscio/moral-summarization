SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but instead want to contribute to the country through starting businesses, serving in the military, and more. He questioned the logic of targeting these young people, asking where they would be sent if they were deported to a country they may not know or remember. Obama claimed that the decision was a political one, not required by law, and a moral question. He emphasized that kicking out DACA recipients would not improve unemployment rates, taxes, or wages. This marks a rare instance of a former president publicly criticizing the current president.
