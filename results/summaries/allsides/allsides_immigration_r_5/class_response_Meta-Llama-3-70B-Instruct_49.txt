SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," but rather want to "serve" and contribute to the country. He emphasized that targeting these young people is "wrong" because they have done nothing wrong and are only seeking to start new businesses, staff labs, and serve in the military. Obama questioned the morality of deporting individuals who are an integral part of their communities, asking "What if our kid's science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer?" He stressed that the decision is a "moral question" and not a legal requirement, and that it will not benefit the country in any way. Obama's words echoed a sense of moral outrage and urgency, urging Americans to consider the human impact of this decision.
