SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticizes President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" move that goes against American values and common sense. Obama argues that DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and are not a threat. He emphasizes that Dreamers are often teachers, neighbors, and first responders who enrich their communities and want to give back to the country that gave them an opportunity. Obama claims that targeting these individuals is unnecessary and immoral, as they have done nothing wrong and are not taking away opportunities from others. Obama's statement comes after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the gradual rollback of the DACA program, which protected young undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. Obama had previously suggested that he would speak out if Trump took action against DACA, despite the tradition of former presidents refraining from criticizing their successors.
