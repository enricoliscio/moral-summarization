Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible from the list provided. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is criticizing Trump for ending DACA, using strong moral language like "cruel" and "wrong." He argues that DACA recipients are innocent and contribute positively to society. The article also mentions the political nature of the decision and the impact on individuals.

I need to identify the key moral terms: cruel, contrary, pose, target, wrong, threaten, helps. I should incorporate these into the summary. I'll structure the summary to highlight Obama's criticism, the reasons he gives, and the moral implications.

I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, using "cruel" and "contrary." Then, mention that DACA recipients pose no threat and are being targeted unfairly. I'll include how they contribute to society and the moral question of deporting them. Finally, I'll note that Trump's action is a political decision, not legally required, emphasizing the moral stance.

I'll make sure the summary flows well, stays within the word limit, and includes all the necessary moral elements without being too verbose. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and "contrary to our spirit and common sense." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others. He emphasized that targeting them is "wrong" because they are innocent and contribute positively to society, such as serving in the military, starting businesses, or helping their communities. Obama questioned the morality of deporting individuals who may not even remember their country of origin, stating that this action is not legally required but a political choice. He urged not to threaten the future of these young people, who are integral members of society, like teachers, first responders, and ROTC cadets. Obamaâ€™s strong moral stance highlights the injustice of the decision, asserting that it does not solve any economic or social issues but instead harms innocent individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
