SUMMARY: Former President Obama condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as morally reprehensible and legally unnecessary. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as Dreamers, contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He emphasized their aspirations to start businesses, serve in the military, and enrich the nation. Obama criticized Trump for targeting a vulnerable group of young people who were brought to the US as children and know no other home. He questioned the cruelty and lack of basic decency in uprooting these individuals, many of whom are integral members of their communities. Obama highlighted that the decision to end DACA was not legally mandated but a political and moral choice. He asserted that deporting Dreamers would not benefit Americans in terms of employment, taxes, or wages. Obama's stance upholds the ethical principle of protecting those who are vulnerable and blameless, while recognizing the potential and contributions of Dreamers as valuable members of American society.
