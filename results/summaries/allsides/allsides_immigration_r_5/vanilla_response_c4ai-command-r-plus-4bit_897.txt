SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" act that goes against American values. Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," contribute positively to American society and pose no threat. He questioned the logic of sending them back to countries they may not remember or speak the language of. Obama emphasized that the decision to end DACA was a political and moral choice rather than a legal necessity. He also highlighted the potential contributions of DACA recipients to various fields such as business, science, and the military. Obama's statement came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the gradual rollback of the program, which provided temporary protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Obama's intervention marked a break from the traditional practice of former presidents refraining from criticizing their successors.
