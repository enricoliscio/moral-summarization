SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but rather want to contribute to the country. He questioned the morality of targeting young people who are in the US through no fault of their own and have done nothing wrong. Obama claimed that the decision is not legally required, but rather a political and moral choice. He emphasized that kicking out DACA recipients will not improve the economy or benefit Americans. The former president had previously hinted that he would speak out against Trump's action on DACA, despite the precedent against former presidents criticizing the current president.
