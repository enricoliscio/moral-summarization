SUMMARY:

Former President Obama condemned President Trump's decision to end the DACA amnesty program, calling it "cruel" and "lacking basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us", emphasizing that they want to "serve" and "contribute" to the country. He questioned the morality of "targeting" these young people, who are "not taking away anything from the rest of us", and asked rhetorically "Where are we supposed to send her?" to a country they may not know or remember. Obama framed the decision as a "moral question", stating that it's not required legally, but a political choice that "threatens the future" of these young people. He highlighted the positive contributions of DACA recipients, such as being a "pitcher on our kid's softball team" or a "first responder who helps out his community". Obama concluded that "kicking them out" won't benefit the country, but rather harm these young people who "love" the country that "gave them a chance".
