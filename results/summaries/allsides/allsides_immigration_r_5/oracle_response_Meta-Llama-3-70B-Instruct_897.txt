SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," but rather want to "serve" and "contribute" to the country. He emphasized that targeting these young people is "wrong" and "self-defeating," as they want to start businesses, staff labs, and serve in the military. Obama questioned the moral implications of sending DACA recipients back to a country they may not know or remember, asking "Where are we supposed to send her?" He framed the decision as a "moral question," urging Americans not to "threaten the future" of these young people who are here through no fault of their own. Obama's post highlighted the positive contributions of DACA recipients, including serving as first responders and wearing the uniform of the country that "gave" them a chance. He concluded that "kicking them out" won't benefit anyone, but rather harm the community.
