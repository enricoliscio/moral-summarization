SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "wrong" political move that threatens the future of young people who "pose no threat." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," contribute positively to American society and are not a threat to anyone. He questioned the morality of the decision, asking if it is right to target people who have done nothing wrong and are an integral part of our communities. Obama also highlighted the potential consequences, such as the loss of teachers, first responders, and members of the military, emphasizing that ending DACA is contrary to our spirit and common sense. He believed that the action taken was not legally required but rather a political decision that could have severe implications for those affected. Obama's statement reflected his stance on the moral and practical implications of ending DACA, a program that offered protection and opportunities to those brought to the country as children.
