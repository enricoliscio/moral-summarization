Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Obama criticizing Trump for ending DACA. He uses strong language like "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." The key points are that DACA recipients are harmless, contribute positively, and that Trump's action is both legally unnecessary and morally wrong. Obama also questions where these people would go and argues it's counterproductive.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many of the specified moral words as possible. The words are: lacking, scrambles, target, selfdefeating, serve, love, send, action, decision, threaten, helps, wear, gave, kicking.

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's criticism, using those words. I'll need to mention Trump's decision, the lack of legal requirement, targeting Dreamers, the self-defeating nature, their contributions (serve), the country they love, sending them away, the action taken, moral questions, threatening their future, helping the community, wearing the uniform, being given a chance, and kicking them out.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally. Let me start drafting, ensuring each moral word is included where appropriate without forcing them in awkwardly.

Wait, the original summary provided by the user already includes all these words. So maybe I just need to make sure my version is accurate and concise, using those terms.

I should check if all the words are included. Let me go through the list: lacking (Obama says Trump lacks decency), scrambles (from the article's related link, but not in the summary), target (used), selfdefeating (used), serve (used), love (used), send (used), action (used), decision (used), threaten (used), helps (used), wear (used), gave (used), kicking (used). Scrambles isn't in the summary, but it's part of the article's related link, so maybe it's not necessary to include it unless it's part of the main content. The main summary doesn't include it, so perhaps it's okay to leave it out.

I think the provided summary is good, but I'll make sure it's within 200 words and all the key points are covered. Also, I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so the language should reflect the criticism and the moral implications.

SUMMARY: Former President Obama criticized President Trump for ending the DACA program, calling the decision "cruel" and "lacking basic decency." He argued that targeting Dreamers is "self-defeating," as they contribute to the country by serving in roles like teachers, first responders, and military cadets. Obama questioned the morality of sending them to a country they may not know, emphasizing that their removal would not solve economic issues. He stressed that this action is a political decision, not legally required, and urged compassion for those who "help" their communities and "wear" the uniform of the country that "gave" them a chance. Kicking them out, Obama said, is both unfair and counterproductive. END OF SUMMARY.
