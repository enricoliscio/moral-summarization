SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but instead want to contribute to the country. He questioned the morality of targeting young people who are in the US through no fault of their own, and asked where they would be sent if deported. Obama claimed that the decision was not legally required, but a political and moral choice. He also emphasized that kicking out DACA recipients would not improve the economy or benefit Americans. This is Obama's first public criticism of Trump's presidency, despite a precedent against former presidents criticizing the current president.
