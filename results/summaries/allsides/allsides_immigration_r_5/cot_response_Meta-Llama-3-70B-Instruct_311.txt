SUMMARY:
Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and "lacking in basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us," emphasizing that they are not responsible for their circumstances. He claimed that targeting these young people is "wrong" because they have done nothing wrong and want to contribute to the country. Obama also pointed out that the decision is a "moral question" and a "political decision," not a legal requirement. He urged Americans not to "threaten the future" of these young people, who are "not taking away anything from the rest of us." Obama's emotional appeal highlighted the human impact of the decision, asking what would happen if a "Dreamer" was a science teacher, neighbor, or first responder. END OF SUMMARY.
