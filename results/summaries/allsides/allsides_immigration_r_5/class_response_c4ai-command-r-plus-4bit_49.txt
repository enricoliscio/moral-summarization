SUMMARY: Former President Obama condemned President Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and are not taking away from Americans. He claimed that targeting these young people is "wrong" and "self-defeating," as they contribute to society and want to serve the country. Obama also questioned the morality of the decision, asking if it is right to threaten the future of innocent individuals. He emphasized that ending DACA won't improve economic conditions for Americans and criticized the administration for prioritizing politics over morality. Obama's response to the DACA rollback highlights his belief in the program's beneficiaries' potential and their positive impact on the country.
