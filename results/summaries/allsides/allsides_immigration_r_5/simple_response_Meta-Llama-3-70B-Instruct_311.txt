SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," pose no threat to the country and are not taking away anything from others. He emphasized that these young people want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and working in labs. Obama questioned the morality of targeting individuals who have done nothing wrong and are only seeking to make a better life for themselves. He also highlighted the human impact of this decision, asking what would happen to a science teacher or friendly neighbor who is a Dreamer. Obama stressed that this was a political decision, not a legal requirement, and that it is morally wrong to threaten the future of these young people who are in the country through no fault of their own.

END OF SUMMARY.
