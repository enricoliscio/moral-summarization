SUMMARY:
Former President Obama strongly condemned President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." Obama argued that DACA recipients "pose no threat" and "are not taking away anything from the rest of us." He emphasized that targeting these young people is "wrong" because they have done nothing wrong and want to contribute to the country. Obama framed the decision as a "moral question" and urged that it is not required legally, but rather a political choice. He highlighted the positive impact of DACA recipients, citing examples of their contributions to the community, and emphasized that kicking them out would not benefit the economy or society. Obama's statement was a strong moral rebuke of Trump's decision, appealing to the nation's sense of justice and compassion. END OF SUMMARY.
