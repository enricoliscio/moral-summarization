SUMMARY:

Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it "cruel" and lacking "basic decency". Obama argued that DACA recipients pose no threat and are not taking anything away from others, but instead want to contribute to the country by starting businesses, serving in the military, and more. He questioned the morality of targeting these young people, who are in the US through no fault of their own, and asked where they would be sent if deported. Obama claimed that the decision was not legally required, but a political and moral choice. He emphasized that kicking out DACA recipients would not lower unemployment rates, lighten taxes, or raise wages.
