SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provided amnesty for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. Obama's critique centered on moral grounds, calling the decision "cruel" and lacking "basic decency." He emphasized that DACA recipients are not a threat and are contributing positively to American society. Obama argued that targeting these individuals is "wrong" and "self-defeating," as they are aspiring entrepreneurs, scientists, and military personnel. He questioned the rationale behind uprooting law-abiding individuals who are integrated into American communities. Obama's stance highlights the moral dilemma of the DACA rollback, emphasizing the human cost and the potential loss of contributions by these individuals.
