SUMMARY: Former President Obama strongly criticized President Trump's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, calling it a "cruel" and "self-defeating" move that threatens the future of young people who pose no threat and only want to contribute to the country. Obama argued that the decision to end DACA, a program that protected undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, was not legally required but rather a "political decision" and a "moral question." He emphasized that DACA recipients are hardworking and aspiring individuals who enrich our communities and our country. Obama's comments come after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration's plan to phase out the program, which Obama himself had implemented through executive action. Obama had previously suggested that he would speak out if Trump took action on DACA, despite the traditional reluctance of former presidents to criticize their successors. Obama's statement highlights the moral implications of the DACA repeal and expresses concern for the well-being and contributions of these young immigrants.
