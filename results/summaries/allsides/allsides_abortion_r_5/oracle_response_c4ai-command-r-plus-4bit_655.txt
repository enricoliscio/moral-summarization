SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats, with Virginia's governor and several presidential candidates endorsing legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. The laws these Democrats support do not require compelling medical reasons for abortion and would deny legal protections to viable, healthy unborn children. This position is unjust and exposes these children to lethal violence, treating them as non-persons. Democrats who hold this extreme view should reconsider or repudiate it, and those who have not adopted it should speak out against it. Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court all have moral obligations to expose and correct this indefensible position, which is both deceptive and outrageous.

END OF SUMMARY.
