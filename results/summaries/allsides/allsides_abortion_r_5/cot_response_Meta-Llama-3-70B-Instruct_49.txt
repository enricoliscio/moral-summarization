SUMMARY:
Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming a mainstream Democratic position, with some politicians even suggesting that a full-term child should be delivered and then allowed to die. This radical and manifestly unjust stance is increasingly being endorsed by leading Democratic presidential candidates, who claim that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons. However, the available evidence does not support this contention, and the laws they support do not require such reasons. This grievous moral error lays moral obligations on all of us, and those who have taken this position should reconsider it. It is unjust to allow unborn children to be killed, and it is the duty of Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate this indefensible position. END OF SUMMARY.
