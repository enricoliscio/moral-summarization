Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article talks about how some Democrats support abortion up to 40 weeks, which is a very late stage. The author is clearly against this stance, so the summary should reflect that opposition.

First, I should identify the main points. Kathy Tran's bill in Virginia, supported by Governor Northam, allows abortion even at full-term. New York has a similar law, and some presidential candidates back this. The author argues that this is unjust and compares it to killing a two-month-old infant, which is prohibited. The author also calls on Republicans, journalists, and the Catholic Church to take action against this stance.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the trend among Democrats supporting late-term abortion. Then, highlight Tran and Northam's positions, the New York law, and the candidates' support. Next, outline the author's moral argument against this, comparing it to infanticide. Finally, mention the call to action for different groups to oppose this stance.

I should avoid any neutral language and instead use terms that show the author's disapproval, like "radical" or "indefensible." Also, ensure that the moral obligations and the comparison to two-month-olds are included to maintain the framing.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the political stance, then the moral argument, and ending with the call to action. I need to make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights a growing mainstream Democratic stance supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," exemplified by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, backed by Governor Ralph Northam. Northam defended the bill, suggesting that in some cases, a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York Democrats have passed a law legalizing abortion at any stage, contingent only on an abortionist's judgment of a woman's health, without requiring the pregnancy itself to threaten her health. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, effectively nullifying state protections for unborn children. The author argues that this stance is morally unjust, as it denies legal protections to viable unborn children, drawing a comparison to the prohibition on killing two-month-old infants. The author criticizes the Democrats' position as deceptive and urges reconsideration. They call on Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to oppose this stance, highlighting the moral obligations to protect unborn children. The article concludes by urging the Supreme Court to reverse its support for abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.  
END OF SUMMARY.
