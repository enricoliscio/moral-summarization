Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming mainstream among Democrats. Virginia legislator Kathy Tran is mentioned, along with Governor Ralph Northam supporting a bill that allows abortion even late in pregnancy, suggesting that in some cases, a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York has a law allowing abortion at any stage if a doctor deems it necessary for the woman's health, which is seen as unenforceable and deceptive.

Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal laws, which would remove state protections for unborn children, except if state laws include health exceptions that make them unenforceable. The article argues that the public doesn't support late-term abortions, so Democrats claim it's only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, but evidence doesn't support this, and the laws don't require such reasons.

The author criticizes the lack of legal protections for viable children, comparing it to killing a two-month-old infant. They argue this is unjust and calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report accurately, Catholic bishops to address the moral error, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: rising support for late-term abortion among Democrats, examples from Virginia and New York, the argument that public doesn't support it, the lack of legal protections, and the call for various groups to address the issue.

Let me structure it clearly, ensuring all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming mainstream among Democrats, with Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam backing a bill allowing late-term abortions, even in cases where a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York has passed a law permitting abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health, a measure criticized as unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, which would override state protections for unborn children, except when state laws include health exceptions that render them unenforceable. The article argues that the public does not support late-term abortions, and while Democrats claim such procedures are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, evidence does not back this, and the laws do not require such reasons. The author criticizes the lack of legal protections for viable children, comparing it to killing a two-month-old infant, and calls the stance unjust. The article urges Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report accurately, Catholic bishops to address the moral error, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
