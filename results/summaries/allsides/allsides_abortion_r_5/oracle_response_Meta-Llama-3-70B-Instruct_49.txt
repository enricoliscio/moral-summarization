SUMMARY:

The article condemns the growing trend among Democrats to explicitly support abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without any restrictions. This extreme position is morally unjust, allowing the killing of unborn children late in pregnancy, even when they are viable and suffer no abnormalities. The laws supported by Democrats, such as the one in New York, are designed to be unenforceable and deceptive, claiming to protect a pregnant woman's health without any limitations. Leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed similar federal legislation, which would wipe away any state laws that protected unborn children. The author argues that this radical difference in treatment between unborn children and born infants is manifestly unjust and lays moral obligations on all of us. Those who support this position should reconsider, and those who don't should repudiate it. The article calls for Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and condemn this grievous moral error. END OF SUMMARY.
