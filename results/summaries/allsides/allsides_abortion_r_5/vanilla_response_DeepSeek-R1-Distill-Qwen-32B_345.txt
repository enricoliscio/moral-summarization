Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about how some Democrats are supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, which is quite late in pregnancy. They mention Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam, who supports her bill. The bill allows abortion even when the child is full-term, suggesting the child could be delivered and then allowed to die. That's pretty extreme.

New York has a law that allows abortion at any stage if a doctor deems it necessary for the woman's health, which isn't limited to physical health. This makes the law unenforceable and deceptive. Many Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal laws, which would override state protections for unborn children, except if the state laws include health exceptions, making them unenforceable too.

The article points out that the public doesn't support late-term abortions, so Democrats claim it's only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the evidence doesn't back this up, and the laws don't require such reasons. The author argues that there's no justification for treating viable unborn children differently from newborns, and this is unjust. They call on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose this stance, journalists to report on it, Catholic bishops to address politicians who support this, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: Democrats supporting late-term abortion, the lack of public support, the deceptive laws, the lack of evidence for medical necessity, the moral argument against it, and the call to action for various groups to address this issue. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the increasingly mainstream Democratic stance on abortion, particularly supporting it up to 40 weeks of pregnancy. Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam support a bill allowing abortion even at full-term, with Northam suggesting the child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York’s law permits abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman’s health, without limiting health to physical conditions, making it unenforceable. Leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse similar federal legislation, overriding state protections for unborn children unless health exceptions are included. While Democrats claim late-term abortions are rare and only for severe fetal abnormalities, evidence does not support this, and the laws do not require such reasons. The author argues that treating viable unborn children differently from newborns is unjust, calling on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report on it, Catholic bishops to address politicians supporting this stance, and the Supreme Court to reverse its abortion-on-demand rulings. END OF SUMMARY.
