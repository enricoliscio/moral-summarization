SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats, with some state legislators and governors endorsing bills that allow abortions even at full term. This position is at odds with public opinion and raises moral concerns about the protection of unborn children. The laws supported by these Democrats do not require compelling medical reasons for late-term abortions and deny legal protections to viable fetuses without abnormalities. The article argues that this position is unjust and that those who hold it have moral obligations to reconsider and repudiate it. It calls on Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court to expose and correct this indefensible stance, which treats unborn children as non-persons and allows them to be subjected to lethal violence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
