SUMMARY:

The article condemns the increasingly mainstream Democratic position of supporting abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, citing Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill and New York's law allowing abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Many leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed similar federal legislation, which would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. The author argues that this position is morally unjust, as it treats viable unborn children differently than two-month-old infants, allowing them to be killed and exposed to lethal violence. The article urges Democrats to reconsider this extreme position, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report on it honestly, and Catholic bishops to address the moral error of Catholic politicians who support it. The Supreme Court is also called upon to reverse its mistaken policy of abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
