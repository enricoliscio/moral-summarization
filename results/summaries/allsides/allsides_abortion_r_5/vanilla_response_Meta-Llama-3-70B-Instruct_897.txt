SUMMARY:

The article discusses the increasing support among Democrats for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, citing examples of legislation and comments from politicians such as Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam. The author argues that this stance is morally unjust and that Democrats are trying to deceive the public by claiming that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, when in fact the laws they support do not require such reasons. The article also calls on various groups, including Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops, to expose and repudiate this extreme position, and for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision allowing abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.
