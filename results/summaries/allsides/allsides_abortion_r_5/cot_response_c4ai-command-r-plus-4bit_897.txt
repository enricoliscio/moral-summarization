SUMMARY: The article exposes the increasingly extreme pro-abortion stance of Democrats, who explicitly support abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy. This position is defended by Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, and supported by leading Democratic presidential candidates. They claim that late-term abortions are only done for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, but the available evidence does not support this contention. These Democrats, including Northam, want to deny legal protections to viable unborn children with no abnormalities and subject them to lethal violence. This is unjust and exposes them to moral obligations to reconsider their extreme position. The article calls on Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate this indefensible stance, reminding Catholic politicians that they have broken communion with the Church if they obstinately persist in this grievous moral error. The Supreme Court is also urged to reverse its mistaken belief that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.
END OF SUMMARY.
