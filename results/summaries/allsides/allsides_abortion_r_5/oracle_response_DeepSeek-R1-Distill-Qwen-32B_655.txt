Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The author uses specific words like "abortion," "protect," "unenforceable," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Democrats supporting late-term abortions, with examples from Virginia and New York. The author criticizes this stance as unjust and deceptive.

I need to highlight the moral arguments, such as the comparison to killing infants and the lack of legal protections for viable fetuses. Also, the author mentions the responsibility of Republicans, journalists, and the Church to address this issue.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using the moral terms. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while maintaining the original's tone.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the increasingly mainstream Democratic support for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," highlighting the moral and legal implications. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam support a bill allowing abortion even in late pregnancy, with Northam suggesting that a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York's law permits abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health, without limiting health to physical health, rendering it unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse similar federal legislation, wiping away state protections for unborn children unless they include unenforceable health exceptions. The author argues that this stance is unjust, as unborn children late in pregnancy differ from newborns in no morally relevant way, yet are treated as non-persons. The article condemns the lack of legal protections for viable fetuses and criticizes the deceptive framing of abortion as only performed for compelling medical reasons. It urges Democrats to reconsider, Republicans and journalists to expose the issue, and the Catholic Church to address politicians who support this stance. The Supreme Court is also called upon to reverse its support for abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
