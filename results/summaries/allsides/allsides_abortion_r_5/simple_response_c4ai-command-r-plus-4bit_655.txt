SUMMARY: Democrats are increasingly embracing an extreme position on abortion, explicitly supporting the procedure "all the way up to 40 weeks." This includes Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, who defended a bill that would allow full-term children to be delivered and left to die. Many Democratic presidential candidates endorse similar federal legislation that would override state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. These Democrats claim that abortion is only done for compelling medical reasons, but the laws they support do not require such justifications. Killing a two-month-old infant is rightly prohibited, and there is no moral difference between them and unborn children late in pregnancy. Exposing these children to lethal violence and denying them legal protection is unjust and immoral. This position should be exposed, opposed, and repudiated by all who recognize the inherent injustice and immorality of treating these unborn children as non-persons. Catholic bishops should also actively engage in pastoral work with Catholic politicians who support this position, reminding them that they have broken communion with the Church. The Supreme Court should also reverse its mistaken belief that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
