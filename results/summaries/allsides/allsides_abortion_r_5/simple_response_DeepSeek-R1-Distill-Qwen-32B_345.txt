Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about how support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming mainstream among Democrats. It mentions Kathy Tran's bill in Virginia, supported by Governor Northam, who suggested that in some cases, a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. Most Democrats don't go that far, but New York has a law allowing abortion at any stage if a doctor says it's necessary for the woman's health, without specifying the pregnancy must threaten her health or limiting health to physical health. This makes the law unenforceable and deceptive.

Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, removing state protections for unborn children, except if laws include health exceptions. They argue that late-term abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, but evidence doesn't support this, and laws don't require such reasons. The article compares this to killing a two-month-old infant, which is prohibited, questioning the moral justification for treating unborn children differently.

The author calls this unjust and lays moral obligations on all, urging Democrats to reconsider, others to repudiate, Republicans and journalists to expose the stance, Catholic bishops to address their politicians, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance.

Now, I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, preserving the moral arguments. I should include the key points: increasing support for late-term abortion among Democrats, examples from Virginia and New York, the deceptive laws, the candidates' stance, the moral comparison to killing infants, and the call for reconsideration and action from various groups.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral framing without losing essential details. I'll structure it by first stating the trend, then the specifics of the laws, the moral arguments, and the call to action.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Support for abortion up to 40 weeks is increasingly mainstream among Democrats, as seen in Virginia with Kathy Tran's bill, backed by Governor Ralph Northam, who suggested allowing full-term infants to die. New York's law permits abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health, without requiring pregnancy-related threats or physical health issues, making it unenforceable. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, removing state protections for unborn children, except when health exceptions are included. They argue late-term abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, but evidence doesn't support this, and laws don't require such reasons. The article compares this to killing a two-month-old infant, questioning the moral justification for treating unborn children differently. It calls this practice unjust and urges reconsideration from Democrats, repudiation from others, exposure by Republicans and journalists, action by Catholic bishops, and reversal by the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
