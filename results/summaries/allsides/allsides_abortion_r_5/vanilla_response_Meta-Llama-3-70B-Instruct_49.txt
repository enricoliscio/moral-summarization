SUMMARY:

The article argues that the Democratic Party is increasingly supporting abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, citing examples from Virginia and New York. Despite claiming that late-term abortions are only done for medical reasons, the laws supported by Democrats do not require such justification. The article asserts that this stance is morally unjust, as it treats unborn children differently than born infants. It calls on Democrats to reconsider their position, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report on it accurately, and Catholic bishops to address the moral error of Catholic politicians who support it. The article also criticizes the Supreme Court for its stance on abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
