SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to full term is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, would allow abortions even for viable, healthy fetuses. Similar legislation has been passed in New York and endorsed by leading Democratic presidential candidates, effectively wiping away any state laws protecting unborn children late in pregnancy. Despite claiming that late-term abortions are only done for medical reasons, the laws do not require such justifications and are based on the deceptive and unenforceable premise of protecting the mother's health. This position is unjust and exposes unborn children to lethal violence, treating them as non-persons. Democrats who support this position should reconsider, and those who do not should repudiate it. Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court all have a moral obligation to expose and rectify this grievous moral error.

END OF SUMMARY.
