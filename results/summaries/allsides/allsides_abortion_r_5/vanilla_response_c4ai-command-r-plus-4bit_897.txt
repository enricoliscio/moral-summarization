SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to full term is gaining traction among Democrats, with Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam backing a bill that would allow abortions even for viable, healthy pregnancies. Similar legislation has been passed in New York, and many Democratic presidential candidates endorse a federal version of the bill. These politicians defend their position by claiming that late-term abortions are only done for medical reasons, despite evidence to the contrary and the fact that their proposed laws do not require such justification. This stance is at odds with public opinion and raises ethical concerns about the unjust treatment of unborn children. Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court are called upon to challenge and expose the Democrats' position, which is seen as morally indefensible and a grievous error.
