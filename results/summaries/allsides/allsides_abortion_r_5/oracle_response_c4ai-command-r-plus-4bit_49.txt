SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, allows for abortion even in the case of viable, full-term pregnancies. This position is shared by New York Democrats and several Democratic presidential candidates who endorse federal legislation that would override state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. These individuals argue that abortion at this stage is only done for compelling medical reasons, but the laws they support do not require such justifications. The public does not support late-term abortions, and the available evidence does not support the contention that they are medically necessary. The denial of legal protections for viable, healthy unborn children is unjust and exposes them to lethal violence. It is imperative for those who hold this extreme position to reconsider and for those who do not to repudiate it. Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops should bring attention to this indefensible stance and the Supreme Court should reverse its mistake of believing that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
