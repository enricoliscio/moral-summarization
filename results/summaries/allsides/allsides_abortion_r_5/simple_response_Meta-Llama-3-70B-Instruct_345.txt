SUMMARY:

The article highlights the alarming trend of explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks among mainstream Democrats. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, backed by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that a full-term child could be delivered and then allowed to die in certain circumstances. Similar laws have been passed in New York, and leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. The article argues that this stance is morally unjust, as it treats viable unborn children as non-persons, exposing them to lethal violence. It is unjust to deny legal protections to these children, and those who support this position should reconsider or repudiate it. The article calls on Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court to expose and reverse this grievous moral error.
