Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they want the summary to include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the increasing support among Democrats for late-term abortion, with specific examples from Virginia and New York. The author is critical, using strong moral language to argue against this stance.

I should identify the key elements: the support for abortion up to 40 weeks, the laws passed in Virginia and New York, the Democrats' arguments, and the author's moral objections. I need to use words like "abortion," "protect," "unenforceable," "deceptive," "killing," "unjust," etc.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the policies, the moral arguments against them, and the call for reconsideration. I'll make sure to include the author's stance on the injustice and the obligations it imposes on various groups.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting bogged down in details. Also, I should maintain the moral tone by using the specified words to convey the author's perspective clearly.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the growing mainstream support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," as explicitly endorsed by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and New York's law allowing abortion at any stage for health reasons, a definition so broad it's unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates back similar federal legislation, aiming to wipe away state protections for unborn children, even in late pregnancy, by requiring health exceptions that render laws unenforceable. While Democrats claim such abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, evidence does not support this, and the laws they endorse do not require such reasons. The author argues that denying legal protections to viable unborn children is unjust, as they differ from newborns in no morally relevant way. Killing them is prohibited and punished for infants, yet unborn children face lethal violence and are treated as non-persons. This injustice imposes moral obligations on all, urging Democrats to reconsider or repudiate this stance, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report without repeating Democratic spin, and Catholic bishops to address politicians who have fallen into this moral error. The Supreme Court, which claims the Constitution mandates abortion-on-demand, should reverse its stance, as the policy is absurd and outrageous. END OF SUMMARY.
