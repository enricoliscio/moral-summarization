Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about pro-abortion policies among Democrats, particularly in Virginia and New York. The author is critical of these policies, arguing that they're extreme and morally wrong. The article mentions specific politicians like Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam, and the laws they support. It also discusses the stance of Democratic presidential candidates and criticizes the media and the Supreme Court for supporting these policies.

I need to highlight the moral issues, so I'll focus on words like "abortion," "protect," "unenforceable," "deceptive," "killing," "unjust," etc. I should structure the summary to show the progression of support for late-term abortion, the laws passed, the lack of public support, and the moral obligations to oppose these policies.

I should start by stating that mainstream Democrats are supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, citing Tran and Northam. Then mention New York's law and how it's unenforceable and deceptive. Include the presidential candidates' support and their spin about medical necessity. Then argue that the evidence doesn't support this and that the laws don't require such reasons. Highlight the moral issue of denying protections to viable fetuses. Conclude by stating the obligations to oppose this stance and the roles of Republicans, media, bishops, and the Supreme Court.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. Also, ensure that the morally framed words are used appropriately to maintain the author's perspective.

SUMMARY: Mainstream Democrats are increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," as exemplified by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam, whose stance includes allowing full-term children to die after delivery. New York Democrats have passed a law legalizing abortion at any stage, provided an abortionist deems it necessary to protect a woman's health, a definition broad enough to be unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse similar federal legislation, wiping away state protections for unborn children, except when health exceptions render them unenforceable. While Democrats claim such procedures are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, evidence does not support this, and the laws do not require such reasons. Denying legal protections to viable fetuses is morally unjust, akin to killing a two-month-old infant. The author argues this is manifestly unjust, laying moral obligations on all to reconsider or repudiate such extreme positions. Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court must expose and reverse this indefensible stance, which the author deems absurd and outrageous. END OF SUMMARY.
