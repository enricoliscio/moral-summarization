SUMMARY:
Democrats are increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" with some, like Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam, advocating for the delivery and potential death of full-term children. This extreme position is shared by New York Democrats and leading presidential candidates, who endorse federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. Despite claims that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, the available evidence suggests otherwise. This manifestly unjust stance treats unborn children as non-persons, exposing them to lethal violence. It is morally obligatory for Democrats to reconsider this position, and for others to repudiate it. The Supreme Court should reverse its mistake, and Catholic bishops should address the grievous moral error of Catholic politicians who support this policy. END OF SUMMARY.
