SUMMARY: Democrats are increasingly endorsing explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks, with some state legislators and presidential candidates advocating for federal legislation to override state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. This position is morally indefensible and unjust, as it allows for the killing and exposure to lethal violence of unborn children who differ only in location from two-month-old infants, who are legally protected. The available evidence does not support the contention that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, and the laws supported by Democrats do not require such reasons. The Democratic position is deceptive and would deny legal protections to viable children with no abnormalities. This extreme position should be reconsidered and repudiated, with Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court all having a role to play in exposing and rectifying this grievous moral error.
END OF SUMMARY.
