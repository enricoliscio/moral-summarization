SUMMARY:

The article discusses the increasingly extreme pro-abortion stance of many Democratic politicians, including Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam, who support abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without restrictions. Similar laws have been passed in New York, and leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. The article argues that this stance is morally unjust, as it treats viable unborn children differently than born infants, and that it is deceptive to claim that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons. The author calls on Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate this extreme position, and for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision allowing abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
