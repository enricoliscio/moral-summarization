SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats, with some state legislators and governors endorsing bills that allow abortion even for full-term pregnancies. The laws are designed to be deceptive and unenforceable, claiming to protect the mother's health without requiring physical health threats or limiting health definitions. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, aiming to wipe away state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. These politicians justify their stance by claiming that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, such as fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the available evidence does not support this claim, and their proposed laws do not require such justifications. This position is unjust and exposes unborn children to lethal violence, treating them as non-persons. It lays moral obligations on all, including Democrats to reconsider their stance, Republicans to expose the truth, journalists to report honestly, and Catholic bishops to provide pastoral guidance to Catholic politicians who have fallen into moral error. The Supreme Court should also reverse its mistaken belief that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
