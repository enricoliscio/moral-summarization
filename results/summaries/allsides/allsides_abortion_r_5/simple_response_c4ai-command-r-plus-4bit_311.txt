SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy is becoming an increasingly mainstream position among Democrats, with Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam defending bills that allow for abortions up to full term. This position is shared by New York Democrats and several Democratic presidential candidates who support federal legislation that would override state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. While Democrats claim that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, the laws they support do not require such reasons and would deny legal protections to viable children with no abnormalities. This treatment of unborn children late in pregnancy as non-persons is unjust and exposes them to lethal violence. It is important to bring this indefensible position to light and for those who hold it to reconsider or repudiate it. Those with moral authority, including journalists and Catholic bishops, should also play a role in addressing this grievous moral error and its implications for society. The Supreme Court should also reverse its mistake of interpreting the Constitution as requiring abortion-on-demand at any stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
