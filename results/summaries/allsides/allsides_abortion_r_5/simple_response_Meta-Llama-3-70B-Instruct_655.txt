SUMMARY:

The article condemns the growing trend among Democrats to support abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, citing examples of legislation and public statements from politicians like Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam. The author argues that this position is morally unjust, as it allows for the killing of viable unborn children with no abnormalities, and that it is deceptive to claim that such abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons. The article asserts that the available evidence does not support this claim, and that the laws in question do not require such reasons anyway. The author calls on Democrats to reconsider their stance, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report on it accurately, and Catholic bishops to address the moral error of Catholic politicians who support it. Ultimately, the author urges the Supreme Court to reverse its decision allowing abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
