SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly embracing an extreme pro-abortion stance, with some lawmakers supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without any restrictions. This position is unjust and allows for the killing of unborn children, even those who are viable and suffer no abnormalities. The laws supporting this stance are designed to be unenforceable and deceptive, and ignore the moral obligations to protect human life. The public is being misled by claims that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, when in fact, the evidence does not support this contention. It is unjust to deny legal protections to unborn children and to treat them as non-persons, exposing them to lethal violence. Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops have a moral duty to expose and repudiate this indefensible position, and the Supreme Court should reverse its mistake and uphold the value of human life.
