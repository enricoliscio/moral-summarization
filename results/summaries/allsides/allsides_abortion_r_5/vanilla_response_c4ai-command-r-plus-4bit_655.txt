SUMMARY: Democrats are increasingly embracing a pro-abortion stance, with some supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks." Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam have proposed and defended a bill allowing abortions up to full-term, even for viable and healthy pregnancies. Similar legislation has been passed in New York, and leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation to override state laws protecting unborn children late in pregnancy. These politicians claim that late-term abortions are only done for medical reasons, but the laws they support do not require such justifications. The Supreme Court's stance on abortion-on-demand at any stage is criticized as absurd and unjust, and the author calls for Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate the Democrats' extreme position.

END OF SUMMARY.
