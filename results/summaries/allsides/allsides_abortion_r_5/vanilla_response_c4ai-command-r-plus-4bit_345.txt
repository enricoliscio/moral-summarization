SUMMARY: In recent years, the Democratic Party has seen a shift towards more radical positions on abortion, with some politicians advocating for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks." This stance is exemplified by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and supported by Governor Ralph Northam. While most Democrats do not share this extreme view, similar positions have been adopted by New York Democrats and several Democratic presidential candidates, who aim to remove restrictions on abortions late in pregnancy. These individuals argue that abortions at this stage are only performed for compelling medical reasons, such as fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the evidence does not support this claim, and their proposed laws do not require such justifications. The article argues that this position is unjust and immoral, calling for those who hold it to reconsider and for Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and challenge this view. The Supreme Court is also criticized for its interpretation of the Constitution, which allows for abortion-on-demand at any stage.

END OF SUMMARY.
