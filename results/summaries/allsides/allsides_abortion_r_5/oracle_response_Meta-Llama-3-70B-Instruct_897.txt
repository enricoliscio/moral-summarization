SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" with no protections for unborn children, even late in pregnancy. This extreme position is unjust and morally wrong, allowing for the killing of viable children with no abnormalities. The laws supported by Democrats are designed to be unenforceable and deceptive, with no limits on health exceptions. Leading presidential candidates have endorsed similar federal legislation, which would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. The public does not share this enthusiasm, and Democrats are misleadingly claiming that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons. However, the available evidence does not support this contention. It is unjust to deny protections to viable children and expose them to lethal violence. This moral error lays obligations on all of us to reconsider and repudiate this stance. Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops must expose and condemn this indefensible position.

END OF SUMMARY.
