Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the shift in the Democratic party's stance on late-term abortions. The author is critical, so I should highlight that.

First, I'll note the Virginia legislator, Kathy Tran, and Governor Northam's support. Then mention New York's law allowing abortions up to 40 weeks, which is a big deal. The author argues this is deceptive because the law isn't enforceable.

Next, the leading Democratic candidates support similar federal laws, removing state protections. The author points out that the public doesn't agree with this, so Democrats claim it's only for medical reasons, but evidence doesn't back that. The author believes unborn children should have the same protections as newborns, making this a moral issue.

I should include the call for reconsideration from Democrats, Republicans exposing the stance, media's role, and the Catholic Church's response. Also, the Supreme Court's role in upholding these laws is criticized.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but cover all key points with the moral angle emphasized.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," highlighted by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam, who defend the policy despite its controversial implications. New York has passed a law allowing abortion at any stage, provided an abortionist deems it necessary for a woman's health, a definition that is broad and unenforceable. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, which would override state laws protecting unborn children, except in cases with health exceptions. The author argues that these laws are deceptive, as they do not require compelling medical reasons and allow killing viable unborn children without abnormalities. The article condemns this stance as unjust, comparing it to the prohibition of killing newborns, and criticizes the Democrats' moral failure. The author calls for reconsideration from Democrats, exposure from Republicans and media, and action from the Catholic Church and the Supreme Court to reverse this "mistake." END OF SUMMARY.
