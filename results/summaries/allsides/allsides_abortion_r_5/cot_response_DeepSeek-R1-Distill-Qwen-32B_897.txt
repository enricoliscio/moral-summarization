Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about how some Democrats are supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, which is a very late stage. They mention specific individuals like Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam, who support this stance. The article criticizes this position as extreme and unjust, comparing it to killing a newborn infant, which is prohibited. It also discusses the laws passed in New York and the federal legislation supported by presidential candidates, arguing that these laws are unenforceable and deceptive.

The moral framing is strong here, using words like "unjust," "radical," "indefensible," and "grievous moral error." The article is making a case against the policies by appealing to justice and moral obligations, suggesting that these laws dehumanize unborn children.

For the summary, I need to condense this information while keeping the moral language intact. I'll mention the support for late-term abortion, the criticism that it's extreme, the comparison to newborns, the deceptive laws, and the call for reconsideration and exposure of this stance. I should ensure that the summary flows logically and stays within 200 words.

I also need to identify the morally framed words first. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words. They include "explicit support," "unjust," "radical," "indefensible," "grievous moral error," "non-persons," "deceptive," "unjust," "moral obligations," "extreme," "prohibit," "unjust," "non-persons,"
