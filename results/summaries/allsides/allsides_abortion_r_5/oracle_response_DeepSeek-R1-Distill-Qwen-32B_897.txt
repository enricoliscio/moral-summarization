Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the increasing support among Democrats for abortion up to 40 weeks, citing Virginia's Kathy Tran and New York's law. It mentions Governor Northam's support and the deceptive nature of the laws. Leading presidential candidates back similar federal legislation, which removes state protections for unborn children. The author argues that this is unjust and calls for reconsideration and repudiation of this stance. They also urge Republicans, journalists, and the Catholic Church to take action.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points: the support for late-term abortion, the deceptive laws, the candidates' backing, the moral argument against it, and the call to action. I'll use as many of the provided moral terms as possible without making the summary too wordy.

I should structure it to highlight the issue, the political support, the moral stance, and the required actions. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key elements are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," with Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam backing a bill that allows abortion even in late pregnancy. New York has passed a law permitting abortion at any stage, provided an abortionist deems it necessary to protect a woman's health, a vague and unenforceable standard. Leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse similar federal legislation, aiming to wipe away state protections for unborn children. The author argues that these laws are deceptive and unjust, as they deny legal protections to viable unborn children. The article condemns the radical stance, comparing it to the prohibited killing of newborns and asserting that unborn children deserve equal protection. It calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report truthfully, and the Catholic Church to address the moral error. The Supreme Court is urged to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. The author emphasizes the moral obligations to protect unborn children and reject the unjust treatment of exposing them to lethal violence. END OF SUMMARY.
