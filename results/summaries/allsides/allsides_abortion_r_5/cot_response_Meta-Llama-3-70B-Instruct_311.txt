SUMMARY:
The Democratic party is increasingly embracing an extreme pro-abortion stance, with some legislators and presidential candidates supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks." This position is morally unjust and manifestly wrong, as it allows for the killing of viable unborn children with no abnormalities. The laws supporting this stance are designed to be unenforceable and deceptive, and are based on the absurd and outrageous notion that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy. It is the moral obligation of all citizens to reject this indefensible position and to protect the rights of unborn children. Catholic bishops, journalists, and the Supreme Court must also take action to expose and reverse this grievous moral error. END OF SUMMARY.
