SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks is becoming a mainstream position for Democrats. This includes cases where the unborn child is viable and suffers no abnormalities, which the author argues is unjust and exposes these children to lethal violence. The available evidence does not support the contention that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, and the laws supported by Democrats do not require such reasons. The position is defended by Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, and endorsed by leading Democratic presidential candidates. It is opposed by Republicans and some journalists, who argue that it is a deceptive and unenforceable policy that denies legal protection to unborn children. The Supreme Court is called upon to reverse its mistake of believing that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage. Those who hold this extreme position are urged to reconsider, and Catholic bishops are encouraged to remind Catholic politicians that they have broken communion with the Church. The injustice of this position lays moral obligations on all of us to expose and repudiate it.
END OF SUMMARY.
