SUMMARY: Explicit support for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy is becoming an increasingly mainstream position among Democrats. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, exemplifies this shift, with Northam defending the bill by suggesting that full-term children could be delivered and left to die in certain circumstances. While most Democrats may not go as far as Northam, similar positions are held by New York Democrats, who have passed a law allowing abortion at any stage of pregnancy if deemed necessary by an abortionist. Many Democratic presidential candidates have also endorsed federal legislation that would override state laws protecting unborn children, even late in pregnancy. Despite public opposition to abortion late in pregnancy, Democrats argue that it is only done for compelling medical reasons, such as severe fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the laws they support do not require such reasons and would deny legal protections to viable children without abnormalities. The article calls for Democrats who hold these extreme positions to reconsider or repudiate them and for Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and challenge this indefensible stance. The Supreme Court is also urged to reverse its mistake of interpreting the Constitution as requiring abortion-on-demand at any stage.
