Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the Democratic party's stance on abortion, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. The author is clearly against this stance, so I need to make sure that's reflected in the summary.

First, I should identify the key points. The article mentions Virginia legislator Kathy Tran supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, with the governor's backing. New York has a law allowing abortion at any stage for health reasons, which the author calls deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal laws, which the author finds unjust.

The author argues that there's no moral justification for allowing abortion late in pregnancy, comparing it to killing a two-month-old infant. They also criticize the Democrats for not having public support and for using misleading reasons. The conclusion calls for reconsideration of the stance and action from Republicans, journalists, and the Church.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the moral arguments against the policies. I'll mention the support from Tran and the governor, the New York law, the federal legislation, the lack of public support, the deceptive nature of the laws, and the moral obligations the author outlines.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the author's framing. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll be brief but include all essential points.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," as exemplified by Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam. New York has passed a law allowing abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health, a provision criticized as unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, which would override state protections for unborn children. The author argues that this stance is morally unjust, as it denies legal protections to viable unborn children, comparing it to killing a two-month-old infant. Despite claims that such abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities, evidence suggests otherwise, and the laws do not require such justifications. The author calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report truthfully, and the Catholic Church to address politicians who support this stance. The Supreme Court is also urged to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
