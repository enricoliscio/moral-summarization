SUMMARY:
Democrats are increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without any restrictions, a position that is morally extreme and indefensible. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that a full-term child should be delivered and then allowed to die in some circumstances. This radical stance is shared by New York Democrats and many leading Democratic presidential candidates, who endorse similar federal legislation that would wipe away any state laws protecting unborn children. This unjust and manifestly immoral position is a grievous moral error that lays moral obligations on all of us. It is absurd and outrageous to claim that the Constitution requires this policy of abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy. END OF SUMMARY.
