SUMMARY: The Democratic Party is increasingly embracing an extreme position on abortion, with some explicitly supporting the procedure "all the way up to 40 weeks". This includes Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and the state's governor, Ralph Northam, who have supported a bill that would allow a full-term child to be delivered and then left to die. Similar positions have been endorsed by leading Democratic presidential candidates and New York Democrats, who have passed a law rendering unenforceable any bans on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. These individuals are aware that their views are not shared by the general public and are attempting to justify their position by claiming that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons. However, the laws they support do not require such reasons, and they would deny legal protections to viable unborn children with no abnormalities. This position is morally indefensible and unjust, and it is important for various actors, including Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops, to expose and repudiate this extreme and immoral stance.

END OF SUMMARY.
