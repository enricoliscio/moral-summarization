SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without any restrictions, with some politicians even suggesting that a full-term child should be delivered and then allowed to die. This radical stance is morally unjust, as it denies legal protections to viable unborn children and treats them as non-persons. The available evidence does not support the claim that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, and the laws being proposed do not require such reasons anyway. This position is a grave moral error, and those who support it should reconsider and repudiate it. Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops have a moral obligation to expose this indefensible position and to remind Catholic politicians that they have broken communion with the Church. The Supreme Court should also reverse its mistake and recognize that the Constitution does not require abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
