Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Democratic party's stance on abortion, especially in later stages of pregnancy. It mentions Kathy Tran and Ralph Northam supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, which is pretty extreme. New York has a law allowing abortion at any stage if a doctor deems it necessary for the woman's health, which is broad and unenforceable. Leading Democratic candidates support similar federal laws, which would override state protections for unborn children. The article argues that this position is unjust and compares it to killing a two-month-old infant, highlighting the moral obligations it creates. It also calls out the media, Republicans, and the Catholic Church to take action against this stance. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I need to capture the main points: the support for late-term abortion, the laws in Virginia and New York, the candidates' positions, the moral arguments against it, and the call to action for different groups. I should make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without getting too detailed. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions. I think that's a solid approach to crafting the summary.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," exemplified by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam. New York has passed a law allowing abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health, a broad and unenforceable measure. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, overriding state protections for unborn children. The article argues that this stance is morally unjust, comparing late-term abortion to killing a two-month-old infant. It calls for Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report objectively, and the Catholic Church to address the moral error of supporting such policies. The Supreme Court is criticized for its role in upholding abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
