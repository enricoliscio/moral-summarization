SUMMARY: 
The Democratic Party is increasingly embracing a pro-abortion stance, with some legislators explicitly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks." This position is morally indefensible as it involves the killing of unborn children who are viable and suffer no abnormalities. The Democrats' support for legislation that allows abortion at any stage of pregnancy, even late-term, is unjust and treats unborn children as non-persons. This indifference to the value of unborn life lays moral obligations on all of us to expose and oppose such injustices. The media, religious leaders, and political opponents should challenge this extreme position, which is opposed by the majority of the public. Additionally, the Supreme Court should reverse its mistaken belief that the Constitution demands abortion-on-demand at any stage. The article concludes by calling on those who have not endorsed this extreme view to repudiate it and for those who have to reconsider their grievous error, which breaks communion with the Church.
END OF SUMMARY.
