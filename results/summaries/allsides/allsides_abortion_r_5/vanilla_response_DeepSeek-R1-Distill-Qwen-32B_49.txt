Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how support for late-term abortions is becoming mainstream among Democrats. It mentions Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam supporting this. New York has a law allowing abortions up to 40 weeks if a doctor says it's necessary for the woman's health, which is a very broad definition. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal laws, which would override state protections for unborn children.

The article argues that these laws are deceptive because they don't require specific medical reasons. It also points out that the public doesn't fully support late-term abortions, so Democrats are justifying them as only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the evidence doesn't back this up, and the laws don't require such reasons.

The author compares late-term abortions to killing two-month-old infants, questioning the moral justification. They argue that this stance is unjust and calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report on it, Catholic bishops to address the issue with politicians, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I should highlight the key points: the shift in Democratic support, specific examples from Virginia and New York, the broad health exceptions, public opinion, justifications lacking evidence, moral arguments against it, and calls to action for different groups.

Let me structure this clearly, ensuring each point is covered without getting too detailed. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and covers all essential aspects without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Support for abortion up to 40 weeks is increasingly becoming a mainstream stance among Democrats, as seen in Virginia and New York. Virginia legislator Kathy Tran and Governor Ralph Northam defend the policy, with Northam suggesting that in some cases, a full-term child could be delivered and allowed to die. New York’s law permits abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman’s health, without limiting health to physical conditions, making it unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, overriding state protections for unborn children. While Democrats claim these abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability, evidence doesn’t support this, and the laws don’t require such reasons. The article argues that killing viable unborn children late in pregnancy is unjust, akin to killing a two-month-old infant. It calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report on it, Catholic bishops to address the moral error among politicians, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
