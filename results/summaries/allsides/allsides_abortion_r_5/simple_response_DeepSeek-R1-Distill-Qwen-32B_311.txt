Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about how some Democrats support abortion up to 40 weeks, which is a contentious issue. The author is critical of this stance, arguing it's unjust and comparing it to killing infants. I should highlight the key points: the Virginia legislator's bill, the governor's support, the New York law, and the presidential candidates' endorsements. I also need to mention the moral arguments against it, the comparison to infants, and the call for reconsideration. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral perspective is clear. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each point is covered without getting too detailed. I'll start with the main actors, their positions, the laws, and then the moral critique. Finally, I'll note the call for action from different groups. That should cover all necessary elements while maintaining the original's tone.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the increasingly mainstream Democratic support for abortion up to 40 weeks, highlighted by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran’s bill and Governor Ralph Northam’s endorsement. New York has passed a law allowing abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman’s health, with a broad definition of health, making it unenforceable. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, effectively nullifying state protections for unborn children. The author criticizes this stance, arguing that it is unjust to allow killing viable unborn children, as it treats them as non-persons. The article contrasts this with the protection afforded to two-month-old infants and condemns the moral inconsistency. It calls on Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report critically, Catholic bishops to address the moral error among politicians, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. The author frames the issue as a grave moral failing, urging action to address the injustice.  
END OF SUMMARY.
