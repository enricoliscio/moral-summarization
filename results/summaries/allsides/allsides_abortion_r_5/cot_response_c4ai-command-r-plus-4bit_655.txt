SUMMARY:
The Democratic Party is increasingly embracing an extreme position on abortion, with some legislators and presidential candidates explicitly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks." This stance is deceptive and unjust, as it would wipe away any protections for unborn children, even those who are viable and suffer no abnormalities. The available evidence does not support the contention that late-term abortions are only done for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability. The laws supported by these Democrats do not require such reasons and would render any bans on late-term abortions unenforceable. 

The article argues that allowing the killing of unborn children late in pregnancy is manifestly unjust and lays moral obligations on all. It calls on Democrats who hold this extreme position to reconsider and those who do not to repudiate it. It also urges Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and challenge this indefensible stance, reminding Catholic politicians that they have broken communion with the Church. Finally, it calls on the Supreme Court to reverse its mistaken belief that the Constitution requires abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.
