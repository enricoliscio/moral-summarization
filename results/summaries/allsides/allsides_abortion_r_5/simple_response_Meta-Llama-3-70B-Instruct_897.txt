SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly embracing a radical pro-abortion stance, with some politicians advocating for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that a full-term child could be delivered and then allowed to die in certain circumstances. Similar laws have been passed in New York, and leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. These Democrats claim that late-term abortions are only done for compelling medical reasons, but the available evidence does not support this contention. The author argues that this stance is morally unjust, as it treats unborn children late in pregnancy as non-persons, denying them legal protections and exposing them to lethal violence. The author calls on Democrats to reconsider their position, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report on it, and Catholic bishops to remind Catholic politicians of their moral obligations.
