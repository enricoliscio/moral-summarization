SUMMARY:

The article discusses the increasingly mainstream Democratic position of supporting abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that in some cases, a full-term child should be delivered and then allowed to die. Similar laws have been passed in New York, and many leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. The article argues that this position is unjust and morally wrong, as it treats unborn children differently than born children. It calls on Democrats to reconsider their stance, Republicans to expose it, journalists to report on it accurately, and Catholic bishops to guide Catholic politicians who support abortion. The article also criticizes the Supreme Court's stance on abortion-on-demand, calling it an absurd and outrageous mistake.
