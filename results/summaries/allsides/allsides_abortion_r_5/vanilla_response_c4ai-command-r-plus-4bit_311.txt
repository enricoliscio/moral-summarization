SUMMARY: Democrats are increasingly embracing an extreme pro-abortion position that supports abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," as evidenced by legislation in Virginia and New York and endorsed by several Democratic presidential candidates. This position is at odds with public opinion and is not supported by available evidence. The laws proposed by Democrats do not require compelling medical reasons for late-term abortions and would deny legal protections to viable unborn children with no abnormalities. The article argues that this position is unjust and places moral obligations on all Americans to expose and repudiate it, including Democrats, Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court.

END OF SUMMARY.
