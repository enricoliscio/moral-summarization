Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand its main points.

The article discusses the increasing support among Democrats for abortion up to 40 weeks, citing examples like Kathy Tran's bill in Virginia and New York's law. It mentions Governor Northam's stance and how some presidential candidates support similar federal legislation. The author criticizes these policies as deceptive and unjust, comparing the treatment of unborn children to newborns. They argue that the laws are unenforceable and that the moral obligations fall on everyone, including Democrats, Republicans, journalists, and the Supreme Court.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I'll start by identifying the key points: the shift in Democratic support, the specifics of the laws, the moral arguments against them, and the call for reconsideration. I should incorporate words like "abortion," "protect," "unenforceable," "deceptive," "unjust," "protections," "deny," "killed," "unjust," "obligations," etc.

I'll structure the summary to first state the shift in support, then describe the laws, the moral critique, and the call to action. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," as exemplified by Virginia legislator Kathy Tran's bill and New York's law, which allows abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health. These laws are criticized as "unenforceable" and "deceptive," as they do not require compelling medical reasons for late-term abortions. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, which would "wipe away" state protections for unborn children, except in cases with health exceptions. The author argues that this stance is "unjust," as it denies legal protections to viable unborn children, treating them as "non-persons." The article condemns the radical difference in treatment between unborn children and newborns, asserting that killing a late-term fetus is "unjust" and "prohibited." The author calls on Democrats to "reconsider" their position, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report without "spin," and the Supreme Court to "reverse" its stance on abortion-on-demand. The moral obligation to protect unborn children is emphasized, urging all parties to act justly and oppose this "outrageous" and "absurd" policy. END OF SUMMARY.
