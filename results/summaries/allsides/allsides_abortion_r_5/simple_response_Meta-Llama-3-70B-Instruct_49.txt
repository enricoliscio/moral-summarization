SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly embracing extreme pro-abortion views, with some politicians supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" of pregnancy. This stance is morally unjust, as it treats unborn children late in pregnancy as non-persons, allowing them to be killed without justification. The laws supported by these Democrats do not require compelling medical reasons, and their claims that late-term abortions are only done for severe fetal abnormalities are not supported by evidence. This radical difference in treatment between unborn children and born infants is manifestly unjust and lays moral obligations on all of us. It is the responsibility of Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate this indefensible position, and for the Supreme Court to reverse its mistake of allowing abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.

END OF SUMMARY.
