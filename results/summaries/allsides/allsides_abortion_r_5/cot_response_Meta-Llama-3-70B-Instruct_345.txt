SUMMARY:
Democrats are increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," a position that is "manifestly unjust." Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, supported by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that a full-term child could be delivered and then allowed to die. New York Democrats have passed a similar law, which is "deceptive" and "unenforceable." Many leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children, allowing abortion at any stage of pregnancy. This "radical" position is "indefensible" and "grievous," and goes against the public's opinion. It is "unjust" to treat unborn children late in pregnancy as non-persons, and those who support this position should reconsider and repudiate it. END OF SUMMARY.
