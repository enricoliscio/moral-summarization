SUMMARY: Unborn children are being denied legal protections by Democrats who support abortion. Abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" is becoming a mainstream position among Democrats, with some even endorsing similar federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children late in pregnancy. These Democrats are aware that the public does not share their enthusiasm for late-term abortions and are trying to justify their position by claiming they are only done for severe fetal abnormalities or unviability. However, the available evidence does not support this claim, and the laws they support do not require such reasons. Killing a two-month-old infant is prohibited and punished, yet unborn children late in pregnancy are being treated unjustly and exposed to lethal violence. This injustice lays moral obligations on all of us to speak out against it. Democrats who support this extreme position should reconsider, and those who have not should repudiate it. It is also the duty of Republicans, journalists, Catholic bishops, and the Supreme Court to expose and correct this indefensible stance.
