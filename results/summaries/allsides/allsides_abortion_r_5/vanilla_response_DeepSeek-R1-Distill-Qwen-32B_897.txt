Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how some Democrats are supporting abortion up to 40 weeks, which is pretty late in pregnancy. Virginia legislator Kathy Tran is mentioned, and her bill is supported by Governor Northam, who even suggested that a full-term baby could be delivered and allowed to die in some cases. That's pretty extreme.

Then it mentions New York passing a law where abortion is legal at any stage if a doctor says it's necessary for the woman's health. The law is so broad that it's almost unenforceable, which seems deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal laws, which would override state protections for unborn children. They argue that these abortions are only for severe fetal abnormalities or viability issues, but evidence doesn't back that up, and the laws don't require such reasons anyway.

The article criticizes this stance as unjust, pointing out that late-term unborn children are treated differently from newborns without a valid reason. It calls for Democrats to reconsider, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report truthfully, Catholic bishops to address politicians who support this, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the shift in Democratic support for late-term abortion, examples from Virginia and New York, the deceptive nature of the laws, the candidates' stance, the lack of evidence for medical necessity, the moral argument against the policy, and the call to action for various groups to address this issue.

Let me structure it: start with the main idea, mention the Virginia and New York examples, explain the laws, the candidates' support, the reasoning vs. reality, the moral argument, and the call for action. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the growing support among Democrats for abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks," exemplified by Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill and New York's recent law allowing abortion at any stage if deemed necessary for a woman's health. These laws are criticized as unenforceable and deceptive. Leading Democratic presidential candidates support similar federal legislation, which would override state protections for unborn children. While Democrats claim these abortions are only performed for severe fetal abnormalities or viability issues, evidence does not support this, and the laws do not require such reasons. The article argues that treating late-term unborn children differently from newborns is unjust and calls for Democrats to reconsider their stance, Republicans to expose the issue, journalists to report objectively, Catholic bishops to address politicians supporting this policy, and the Supreme Court to reverse its stance on abortion-on-demand. END OF SUMMARY.
