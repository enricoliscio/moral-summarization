SUMMARY:

The article discusses the increasing support among Democrats for abortion up to 40 weeks of pregnancy, with some politicians and presidential candidates endorsing federal legislation that would allow abortion at any stage of pregnancy. This stance is deemed unjust and morally wrong, as it treats unborn children late in pregnancy differently than born children. The article argues that the available evidence does not support the claim that late-term abortions are only done for medical reasons, and that the laws being proposed do not require such reasons. The author calls on Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops to expose and repudiate this extreme position, and for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision allowing abortion-on-demand at any stage of pregnancy.
