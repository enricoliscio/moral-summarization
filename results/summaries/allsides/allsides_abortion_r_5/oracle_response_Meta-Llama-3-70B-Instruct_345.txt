SUMMARY:

The Democratic party is increasingly supporting abortion "all the way up to 40 weeks" without any restrictions, a stance that is morally unjust. Virginia state legislator Kathy Tran's bill, backed by Governor Ralph Northam, suggests that a full-term child can be delivered and then allowed to die in certain circumstances. Similar laws have been passed in New York, and leading Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed federal legislation that would wipe away state laws protecting unborn children. These laws are designed to be unenforceable and deceptive, allowing abortions at any stage of pregnancy without any real restrictions. This stance denies legal protections to viable unborn children, treating them as non-persons and exposing them to lethal violence. It is unjust to allow this and lays moral obligations on all of us to reconsider and repudiate this extreme position. Republicans, journalists, and Catholic bishops must expose and condemn this indefensible stance, and the Supreme Court must reverse its mistake.

END OF SUMMARY.
