SUMMARY:
The public health community is facing a stark reminder of the cruel reality of racism as a public health crisis. The recent police violence against Black Americans and the legacy of slavery highlight this crisis. Racism is not only visible in police brutality but also in the social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, income disparities, housing insecurity, and access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces. The consequences of structural racism and chronic stress caused by discrimination have adverse effects on the health of Black individuals, contributing to higher rates of hypertension, asthma, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. Evidence suggests that racism endured by Black mothers contributes to alarmingly high maternal and infant mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these health inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Black Americans are also disproportionately affected by air pollution, which is linked to higher coronavirus death rates. It is time to acknowledge and address systemic racism and its detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the Black community. We must recognize the entrenched discrimination that continues to harm and shorten lives, and push for meaningful policy changes to address these injustices.
