Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author presented. The article discusses how racism is a public health crisis, focusing on police violence, underlying health conditions, and systemic issues like structural racism and environmental factors. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the author connects racism to higher rates of diseases in Black Americans, the role of social determinants like housing and education, the impact of chronic stress from discrimination, and how the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities. They also mention examples like George Floyd and Erica Garner to illustrate the points.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements without being too detailed. It's important to highlight the moral stance against systemic racism and the call for policy change. I'll aim for a concise summary under 200 words, starting with the key statement about racism as a public health crisis and then touching on each main point briefly.

SUMMARY: The article underscores that racism is a public health crisis, evident in the disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Police violence and underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are linked to systemic racism. Social determinants like housing, education, and job opportunities perpetuate health inequities. Chronic stress from discrimination exacerbates health issues, including high blood pressure and maternal mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these disparities, with Black and brown communities facing higher infection and death rates. Environmental factors, such as living near polluting facilities, further contribute to poor health outcomes. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pushing for meaningful policy change to address these inequities. END OF SUMMARY.
