Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this user's query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, focusing on preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. My task is twofold: identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about how racism affects public health, particularly impacting Black Americans. The author uses strong language to convey the moral issues. I need to extract each single word that carries a moral connotation. Words like "crisis," "gut-wrenching," "legacy," "cruel," "ironic," "deflect," "undermine," "hard," "chronic," "alarming," "disproportionate," "exacerbated," "knee," "neck," "responsibility," "entrenched," "hurting," "short," "growing," "justice," "meaningful," "change." These words are key because they highlight the moral aspects of the issue.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should be under 200 words and include as many of these moral words as possible. I should focus on the main points: racism as a public health crisis, the impact on health conditions, systemic issues like job disparities, the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate effects, and the call for policy change.

I have to ensure the summary flows well while preserving the moral framing. I'll start by stating racism as a public health crisis, mention the higher rates of health issues among Black Americans, discuss structural racism's role, and then touch on the pandemic's impact. Finally, I'll conclude with the need for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism through policy changes.

I should double-check that each morally framed word is included and that the summary doesn't exceed the word limit. It's important to maintain the article's tone and message accurately while keeping it concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights that racism is a public health crisis, disproportionately affecting Black Americans through higher rates of chronic diseases, systemic inequities, and police violence. Structural racism underlies disparities in housing, education, and job opportunities, contributing to poorer health outcomes. Racism itself causes chronic stress, exacerbating health issues like hypertension and heart disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with Black communities facing higher infection and death rates due to underlying health conditions and environmental factors like air pollution. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pressing for meaningful policy change to address these injustices.
