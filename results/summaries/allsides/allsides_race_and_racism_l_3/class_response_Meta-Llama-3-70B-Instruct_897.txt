SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to cruel health outcomes. Black Americans suffer from higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease due to systemic racism. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The covid-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of covid-related death as white counties. Black and brown Americans receive worse care and are more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions that make the coronavirus deadly. It is our responsibility to acknowledge and address systemic racism, which has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and to press for meaningful policy change to ensure justice and equality.
