SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans, particularly through police violence. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among black Americans. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. Black and brown Americans are more likely to contract the disease, receive worse care, and suffer from underlying health conditions that make the coronavirus deadly. Systemic racism has had its "knee on the neck" of the African American community since America began, and it's time to acknowledge and address it. We have a responsibility to press for meaningful policy change to end this crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
