SUMMARY:

The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis in the United States. It cites the police violence that disproportionately affects black Americans, as well as the legacy of slavery and discrimination that persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The article notes that black Americans suffer from higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which can be attributed to systemic racism. The chronic stress caused by discrimination can lead to adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these health inequities, with black and brown Americans being disproportionately affected. The article concludes that it is time to acknowledge and address systemic racism, and that policy changes are necessary to address the health disparities faced by the African American community.
