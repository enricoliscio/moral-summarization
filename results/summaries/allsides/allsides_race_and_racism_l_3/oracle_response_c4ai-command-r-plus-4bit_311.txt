SUMMARY: The recent killings of African Americans have brought to light the pervasive racism in the United States, which is a public health crisis. Racism manifests in police brutality, killing Black Americans at a higher rate than White Americans. It is also evident in the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine and social determinants of health. The higher rates of underlying health conditions in Black Americans, such as diabetes and hypertension, are a result of racism and social inequities. Structural racism and personal experiences of racism contribute to chronic stress, negatively impacting physical and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Air pollution exposure, which disproportionately affects Black Americans, is linked to coronavirus deaths. It is crucial to acknowledge and address systemic racism and its detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the African American community. We must use available tools to identify and address the harmful effects of entrenched discrimination and strive for meaningful policy changes to achieve justice.
