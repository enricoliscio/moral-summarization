SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody, has sparked protests and outrage across the United States and the world. The article argues that racism is a public health crisis, highlighting the higher rates of police violence and underlying health conditions among black Americans. Structural racism and social determinants, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education and healthy food, contribute to health inequities. Racism itself has adverse effects on health, causing chronic stress and leading to high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. The author calls for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism and its detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the African American community.
