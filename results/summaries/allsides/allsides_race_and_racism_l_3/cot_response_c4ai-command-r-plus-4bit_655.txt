SUMMARY: The recent tragic events have brought to light the harsh reality that racism is a public health crisis. The cruel and ironic fact that "underlying health conditions" are blamed for the death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, highlights the deadly role of racism. Structural racism and social determinants have caused vast health disparities, with communities of color facing inequalities in job opportunities, income, housing, and access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces. Racism itself is harmful, causing chronic stress and adverse health outcomes. The covid-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties suffering higher infection and death rates. Black Americans are more likely to be essential workers and face higher risks of coronavirus exposure and underlying health conditions that make the disease deadly. The link between air pollution exposure and coronavirus deaths is striking, with black Americans more likely to live near polluting facilities. It is imperative to acknowledge and address systemic racism and its detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the African American community.
