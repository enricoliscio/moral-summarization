SUMMARY:

The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis in the US, particularly in the context of police violence and the COVID-19 pandemic. It emphasizes that racism is a key driver of health inequities, with black Americans suffering from higher rates of chronic diseases, obesity, and sleep deprivation compared to white Americans. The article cites a growing body of literature that shows social determinants, such as job opportunities, income, and housing security, are key drivers of health inequities. Chronic stress caused by discrimination can trigger adverse health outcomes, and evidence suggests that racism endured by black mothers contributes to high maternal and infant mortality rates. The article concludes that systemic racism has had a devastating impact on the African American community and calls for policy change to address these health inequities.
