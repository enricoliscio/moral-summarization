Okay, so I need to summarize this article about racism as a public health crisis. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about how racism affects public health, especially in the context of police violence against Black Americans. It mentions that Black people are killed by police at nearly three times the rate of whites. Then it connects this to the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine and social determinants of health.

It points out that some people are using "underlying health conditions" to explain George Floyd's death, which the author sees as a way to deflect blame. But this also highlights how racism contributes to higher rates of chronic diseases among Black Americans, like diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease. The article explains that social determinants, like where you live, work, and play, are key factors in health inequities.

It goes on to discuss how structural racism leads to disparities in job opportunities, income, housing, education, and access to healthy food. These factors contribute to chronic stress, which can cause various health issues. The article also mentions the impact on maternal and infant mortality, citing Erica Garner's case.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made these inequities more visible. Black counties have higher infection and death rates. Black and brown essential workers are at higher risk, and even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, they receive worse care. The article also ties in air pollution, noting that Black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, leading to higher asthma death rates and increased COVID-19 risk.

Finally, the author calls for facing systemic racism and taking action to address it through policy changes.

So, the summary should cover the main points: racism as a public health crisis, police violence, health disparities, social determinants, COVID-19 impact, and the call for change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its impact on Black Americans through police violence, health disparities, and systemic inequalities. Black individuals face higher rates of chronic diseases and are disproportionately affected by structural racism, which undermines access to resources like housing, education, and healthcare. Chronic stress from discrimination contributes to adverse health outcomes, including higher maternal and infant mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates, and Black essential workers facing greater risks. Additionally, air pollution disproportionately affects Black communities, contributing to health issues like asthma and increased COVID-19 mortality. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and implementing meaningful policy changes to address these inequities. END OF SUMMARY.
