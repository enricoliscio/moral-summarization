SUMMARY: This article exposes the cruel reality that racism is a public health crisis in the United States. The author argues that the recent killing of George Floyd and the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the deadly consequences of systemic racism and the underlying health injustices faced by Black Americans. The evidence is undeniable; communities of color suffer from higher rates of chronic diseases and adverse birth, living, and working conditions due to generations of entrenched discrimination and structural racism. The consequences are hard on the mental and physical well-being of Black individuals, contributing to alarming health disparities and shortening their lives. Predominantly Black counties are experiencing higher infection and death rates from COVID-19, with Black and Brown Americans making up a disproportionate number of essential workers. The author calls for a collective responsibility to address these injustices and to press for meaningful policy changes to improve the health and well-being of the African American community.
