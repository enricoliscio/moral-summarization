SUMMARY: 

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that kills Black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine, contributing to health inequities. The recent death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, highlights the cruel reality of racism. Some have pointed to "underlying health conditions" as a contributing factor, but this deflects blame from the officers responsible. In reality, racism is deadly, driving higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among Black Americans. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with Black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of COVID-related death. It is our responsibility to acknowledge and address systemic racism, which has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began. We must press for meaningful policy change to address these health inequities and ensure justice.
