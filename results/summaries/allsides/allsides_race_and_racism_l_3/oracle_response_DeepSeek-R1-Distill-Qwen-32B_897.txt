Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about racism as a public health crisis, focusing on police violence, health disparities, and systemic issues. 

First, I'll identify the key points: police violence leading to higher death rates among Black Americans, underlying health conditions linked to racism, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these inequities. The author uses strong moral terms like "crisis," "kills," "discrimination," and "justice."

I should start by stating that racism is a public health crisis. Then, mention the police violence statistics. Next, explain how underlying health issues are rooted in racism, including structural factors like housing and education. 

I need to include the COVID-19 impact, noting higher infection and death rates in Black communities and the role of air pollution. Finally, emphasize the need for systemic change and justice.

I'll make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. Keep it concise, around 200 words, and end with the call for justice and policy change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that racism is a public health crisis, evident in police violence that disproportionately kills Black Americans and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine. It notes that underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are more prevalent among Black Americans due to systemic racism and social determinants like housing, education, and access to healthy food. Chronic stress from discrimination contributes to adverse health outcomes, including heart disease and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black communities facing higher infection and death rates, partly due to living near polluting facilities. The author calls for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism, emphasizing the need for policy change to address these injustices. END OF SUMMARY.
