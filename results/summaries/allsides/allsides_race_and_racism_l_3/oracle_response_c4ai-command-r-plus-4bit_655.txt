SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis. The recent police violence that killed an African American man, George Floyd, is a visceral reminder of this reality. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of underlying health conditions in black Americans. Structural racism and its consequences have detrimental effects on mental and physical well-being. Racism itself causes chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. Black Americans are also disproportionately represented among essential workers and are more likely to live near polluting facilities, impacting their health. We must acknowledge the systemic racism that has harmed the African American community and address its harmful effects on health. We have the tools to identify and address these entrenched discriminations and strive for justice and policy change.
