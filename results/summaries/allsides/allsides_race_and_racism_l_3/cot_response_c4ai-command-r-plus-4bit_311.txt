SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis. This is gut-wrenching and visible in police violence against Black Americans, as well as the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The cruel and ironic deflection of blame for George Floyd's homicide to his "underlying health conditions" illuminates how racism kills. Social determinants are key drivers of health inequities, with communities of color facing vast disparities in opportunities, income, and access to basic needs and quality education. Racism itself is hard on a person’s health, causing chronic stress that leads to adverse health outcomes. The covid-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities further, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates, and Black and Brown essential workers at higher risk. Structural racism and its consequences are well-documented, with enduring racism contributing to alarmingly high maternal and infant mortality rates. Data and research highlight the responsibility to address systemic racism and its impact on health, with entrenched discrimination hurting health and cutting lives short. We cannot let this moment for justice fade without pressing for policy change. END OF SUMMARY.
