Alright, I need to summarize this article about racism as a public health crisis. The article talks about police violence against black Americans, higher death rates, and underlying health conditions. It mentions how systemic racism affects health through social determinants like housing, education, and access to healthy food.

I should highlight the key points: police violence, higher rates of diseases in black communities, and how racism causes chronic stress leading to health issues. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on black and brown communities, including higher infection and death rates, and the role of air pollution.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating that the article argues racism is a public health crisis, then mention police violence and health disparities. Next, I'll cover the social determinants and chronic stress. Finally, I'll include the COVID-19 statistics and the call for policy change.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and directly addresses the main points without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The article argues that racism is a public health crisis, evident in police violence against Black Americans, who are killed at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. It highlights how systemic racism contributes to higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension among Black communities, exacerbated by social determinants such as limited access to quality education, housing, and healthcare. Chronic stress from discrimination further harms health, leading to conditions like high blood pressure and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black counties experiencing three times the infection rate and six times the death rate of white counties. Black and brown essential workers face higher risks of contracting the virus and receiving subpar care. Air pollution, disproportionately affecting Black communities, also contributes to higher COVID-19 mortality. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and implementing meaningful policy changes to address these health disparities. END OF SUMMARY.
