Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about systemic racism and its impact on public health. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how racism is a public health crisis, affecting everything from police violence to health conditions, education, housing, and more. The article also ties in the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate impact on Black communities.

For step one, I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "racism," "crisis," "violence," "killed," "discrimination," "cruel," "ironic," "deflect," "blame," "homicide," "inequities," "disparities," "opportunity," "inherited," "wealth," "housing," "security," "access," "quality," "green," "undermine," "hard," "stress," "discrimination," "adverse," "outcomes," "immunodeficiency," "aging," "mortality," "disproportionate," "essential," "risk," "contracting," "worse," "care," "socioeconomic," "exposure," "polluting," "facilities," "justice," "change."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, using as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight the main points: racism as a public health crisis, police violence, health disparities, structural racism's impact on social determinants, the COVID-19 pandemic's role in exposing these inequities, and the call for policy change.

I'll start by stating that the article argues racism is a public health crisis, then mention the statistics on police violence. Next, I'll touch on health disparities and the role of social determinants. Then, I'll connect this to the COVID-19 pandemic, explaining the higher infection and death rates in Black communities. Finally, I'll emphasize the need for acknowledging systemic racism and pushing for policy changes.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the key moral words without making it too verbose. I should check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft it and then review to make sure it's concise and covers all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article argues that racism is a public health crisis, evident in the disproportionate police violence against Black Americans and the legacy of discrimination in medicine and social determinants of health. It highlights how systemic racism contributes to higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, among Black communities, while also noting that underlying health conditions, often rooted in racial inequities, are used to deflect blame from police violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities, with Black and brown communities facing higher infection and death rates due to structural racism, limited access to quality care, and environmental hazards like air pollution. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pushing for meaningful policy change to address these inequities. END OF SUMMARY.
