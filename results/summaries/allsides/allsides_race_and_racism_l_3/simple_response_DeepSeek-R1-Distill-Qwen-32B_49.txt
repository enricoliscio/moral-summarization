Okay, so I need to summarize this article about racism as a public health crisis. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by stating that racism is a public health crisis, especially highlighted by police violence against Black Americans. It mentions that Black people are killed by police at nearly three times the rate of whites. Then it talks about how some people try to deflect blame by pointing to underlying health conditions, which the author sees as a way to avoid accountability. This ties into how racism affects health outcomes.

The article goes on to discuss the higher rates of chronic diseases among Black Americans, like diabetes and hypertension, and how these are linked to structural racism. It mentions social determinants of health, such as housing, education, and access to healthy food, which are worse for communities of color. It also points out that chronic stress from discrimination leads to health issues like heart disease and weakened immune systems.

Then it brings up the COVID-19 pandemic, showing how Black and Brown communities are disproportionately affected. They have higher infection and death rates, are more likely to be essential workers, and receive worse care when infected. The article also ties in air pollution, noting that Black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to asthma and COVID-19 risks.

The author quotes James Baldwin about facing problems to change them and calls for systemic change to address racism's impact on health. They emphasize the need for policy changes based on the evidence presented.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points concisely, keeping the moral tone about systemic racism and its health impacts. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and impactful. Let me structure it step by step, covering police violence, health disparities, social determinants, chronic stress, COVID-19 statistics, air pollution, and the call to action for change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact on Black Americans. Police violence, which kills Black individuals at nearly three times the rate of whites, underscores this reality. The author critiques the use of "underlying health conditions" to deflect blame, noting that racism itself drives higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension among Black communities. Structural racism, through disparities in housing, education, and access to resources, contributes to these inequities. Chronic stress from discrimination exacerbates health issues, including heart disease and weakened immunity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities, with Black and Brown communities facing higher infection and death rates, worse care, and greater exposure to pollutants linked to asthma and COVID-19. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pressing for policy changes to address these inequities. END OF SUMMARY.
