Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about racism as a public health crisis, so I should include that. It mentions police violence killing black Americans at higher rates, so I'll note that. The author points out that underlying health conditions are often used to deflect blame, which is a moral issue. I should include terms like "cruel" and "homicide" here.

The article also discusses the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine, leading to health inequities. I'll mention the higher rates of diseases among black Americans and how racism contributes to these conditions. Terms like "disparities," "immunodeficiency," and "mortality" are important to include.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these inequities, so I'll mention the higher infection and death rates in black communities. Essential workers being disproportionately affected is another point. I should also touch on air pollution's impact, as it's a social determinant of health.

The author calls for facing systemic racism and taking responsibility to address it. I'll end with the need for policy change and justice, using words like "justice" and "fade."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include as many of the listed moral terms as possible. Let me structure it to flow from the public health crisis, through the pandemic's impact, to the call for action.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact through police violence, higher mortality rates for black Americans, and systemic inequities. It condemns the use of "underlying health conditions" to deflect blame from police actions, such as in George Floydâ€™s homicide. Racism perpetuates disparities in health outcomes, with black Americans facing higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, driven by structural discrimination and chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with black counties experiencing three times the infection rate and six times the death rate compared to white counties. Black and brown essential workers face greater risk, and even when infected, receive worse care. Air pollution, disproportionately affecting black communities, further contributes to health vulnerabilities. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and taking responsibility to address these injustices through policy change, ensuring justice and equity for all. END OF SUMMARY.
