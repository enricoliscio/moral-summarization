SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd has brought to light the stark reality of racism as a public health crisis. The disproportionate impact of police violence on Black Americans and the underlying health conditions that contribute to their higher mortality rates are reminders of the deadly consequences of racism. Social determinants, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education and healthy food, play a significant role in health inequities. Racism itself causes chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes such as high blood pressure and heart disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Additionally, Black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to higher asthma death rates among Black children. It is imperative to acknowledge and address systemic racism and its detrimental effects on the health and well-being of the African American community.
