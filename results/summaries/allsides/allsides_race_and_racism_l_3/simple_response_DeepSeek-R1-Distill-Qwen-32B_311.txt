Okay, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that racism is a public health crisis. It mentions police violence against Black Americans and how it's a visible example. Then it talks about underlying health conditions being used to deflect blame, which is another way racism is deadly. It lists higher rates of diseases among Black Americans and the role of social determinants like job opportunities, housing, education, and access to healthy food.

The author also discusses how chronic stress from discrimination affects health, leading to issues like hypertension and heart disease. It mentions the impact on maternal and infant mortality, using Erica Garner's case as an example.

The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighted as exposing these inequities. Black counties have higher infection and death rates. Essential workers, disproportionately Black and Brown, are at higher risk. Even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, they receive worse care and are more likely to have underlying health conditions.

Air pollution is another factor, with Black Americans more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to higher asthma rates and COVID-19 deaths. The article ends with a call to face systemic racism and push for policy change.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. I should mention racism as a public health crisis, police violence, underlying health conditions, social determinants, chronic stress, COVID-19 disparities, air pollution, and the call to action.

Let me structure it: Start with the main point about racism being a public health crisis. Then mention police violence and the use of underlying health conditions to deflect blame. Next, discuss social determinants and chronic stress. Then, address COVID-19 disparities and air pollution. Finally, conclude with the call to action.

I should ensure each point is concise and flows logically. Also, maintain the moral tone by emphasizing the systemic issues and the need for change.

SUMMARY: The article underscores that racism is a public health crisis, evident in higher rates of police violence against Black Americans and the use of underlying health conditions to deflect blame for deaths like George Floyd's. Black Americans face disparities in health outcomes due to social determinants like limited access to quality education, housing, and healthcare. Chronic stress from discrimination exacerbates health issues, contributing to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and maternal mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black and Brown communities suffering disproportionately from infection and death rates, partly due to higher exposure to air pollution and inadequate healthcare. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pushing for policy changes to address these health disparities. END OF SUMMARY.
