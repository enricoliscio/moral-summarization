SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd is a stark reminder of the public health crisis that is racism. Police violence, which kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans, is a visceral manifestation of this crisis. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among black Americans. Racism itself is hard on a person's health, causing chronic stress that triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of COVID-related death as white counties. It is time to acknowledge that systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and we have a responsibility to address it. We must press for meaningful policy change to end this crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
