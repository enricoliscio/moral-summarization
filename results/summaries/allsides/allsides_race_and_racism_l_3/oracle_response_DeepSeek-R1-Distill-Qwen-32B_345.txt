Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses how racism is a public health crisis, particularly highlighting police violence against Black Americans. It mentions that Black people are killed by police at nearly three times the rate of whites. The author also talks about the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine and social determinants of health.

There's a part about how some people point to underlying health conditions as a factor in George Floyd's death, which the author sees as deflecting blame from the officers. This ties into how racism contributes to higher rates of diseases among Black Americans.

The article also covers how structural racism affects access to resources like housing, education, and healthy environments, leading to worse health outcomes. It mentions chronic stress from discrimination causing health issues like heart disease and immunodeficiency.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the disparities have become more evident. Black counties have higher infection and death rates, and Black essential workers are at higher risk. Air pollution is another factor, with Black communities more likely to live near polluting facilities, leading to higher asthma and COVID death rates.

The author quotes James Baldwin, emphasizing the need to face systemic racism and take responsibility for change. They stress the importance of acknowledging these issues and pushing for policy changes.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: racism, crisis, violence, kills, slavery, discrimination, death, homicide, deflect, stress, outcomes, immunodeficiency, justice, pressing.

I'll structure the summary to cover each main point concisely, using those words to maintain the moral tone. I'll aim for around 200 words, ensuring it's clear and captures the essence of the article without losing the moral emphasis.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that racism is a public health crisis, evident in police violence killing Black Americans at nearly three times the rate of whites. It also points to the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine and social determinants of health. The author criticizes the use of "underlying health conditions" as a deflection from police responsibility in George Floyd's homicide, noting that racism itself contributes to higher rates of chronic diseases among Black Americans. Structural racism undermines access to housing, education, and healthy environments, while chronic stress from discrimination leads to adverse health outcomes, including immunodeficiency and accelerated aging. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates, and Black essential workers facing greater risks. Air pollution disproportionately affects Black communities, contributing to higher asthma and COVID mortality. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and pressing for policy change to address these injustices. END OF SUMMARY.
