Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the author's emphasis on racism as a public health crisis.

First, I'll identify the key points: the article discusses how racism affects public health, citing higher death rates for Black Americans, underlying health conditions, and systemic issues like slavery and discrimination. It also mentions the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these disparities.

I need to include the morally charged words like "racism," "crisis," "violence," "kills," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the connection between systemic racism and health outcomes, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words.

I'll start by stating racism as a public health crisis, mention police violence and health disparities, then discuss the pandemic's impact. I'll conclude with the call to action for justice and policy change, using words like "acknowledge," "address," and "justice."

I should make sure each sentence flows logically, connecting the moral issues to the health outcomes without losing the author's tone. Let me draft this, checking word count and ensuring all key moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact on Black Americans. Police violence, historical slavery, and discrimination contribute to higher death rates and health disparities. Black individuals face higher rates of chronic diseases, partly due to structural racism and chronic stress from discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with Black counties experiencing triple the infection rates and six times the death rates of white counties. Black and brown essential workers are disproportionately exposed to the virus, and even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, they receive worse care. Air pollution, which Black Americans are more likely to endure, further compounds these risks. The article calls for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism, urging policy changes to address these injustices and improve health outcomes for marginalized communities. END OF SUMMARY.
