SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd has brought to light the persistent issue of racism as a public health crisis in the United States. Racism kills black Americans at a much higher rate than white Americans through police violence and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The higher rates of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma in the black community are a result of systemic racism and contribute to the inequities seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has exposed these inequities further, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Structural racism and discrimination cause chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes such as high blood pressure, heart disease, immunodeficiency, and accelerated aging. It is crucial to acknowledge and address the systemic racism that has been hurting and cutting short the lives of African Americans since the beginning of America. We must not let this moment pass without demanding meaningful policy changes to address these injustices.
