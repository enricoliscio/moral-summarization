SUMMARY:
Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among black Americans. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers a cascade of adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The covid-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of covid-related death as white counties. It is time to face the immutable fact that systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and we have a responsibility to acknowledge it and address it.
