SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among black Americans. The role of racism in these underlying conditions cannot be denied, as it contributes to chronic stress, adverse health outcomes, and even immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of COVID-related death as white counties. It is cruel to deflect blame from the officers whose actions ended George Floyd's life, and it is time to face the immutable fact: systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began. We have a responsibility to acknowledge and address this crisis, and to press for meaningful policy change to ensure justice and end the hurting and cutting of lives short.
