SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd is a stark reminder of the public health crisis that is racism. Police violence disproportionately affects black Americans, who are killed at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. This is a result of systemic racism, which has been perpetuated through slavery, discrimination, and social determinants of health. The underlying health conditions that contribute to these deaths, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, are also linked to racism. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The covid-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with black Americans facing higher rates of infection and death. It is time to acknowledge and address the fact that systemic racism has been suffocating the African American community since America's inception. We have a responsibility to make meaningful policy changes to address these injustices and ensure justice for all. END OF SUMMARY.
