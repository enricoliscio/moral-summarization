SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis. The police violence that kills Black Americans at a much higher rate than white Americans is a visceral reminder of this reality. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and across social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease in Black communities. Racism is a key driver of health inequities, and its consequences are hard on a person's health, causing chronic stress and adverse health outcomes. The covid-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing higher rates of infection and death. Black Americans are also more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to a higher asthma death rate among Black children. We must acknowledge the systemic racism that has hurt and cut short the lives of African Americans and address it through meaningful policy change.
