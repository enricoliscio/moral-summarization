SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that disproportionately affects Black Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, among Black Americans are linked to systemic racism. The conditions in which they live, work, and play, including limited job opportunities, income, and access to quality schools and healthcare, undermine their mental and physical well-being. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, and racism itself is a significant contributor to health inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black Americans facing higher infection and death rates, and receiving worse care. It is time to acknowledge systemic racism as a public health crisis and address it through policy change.
