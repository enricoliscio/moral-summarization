SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, is a stark reminder that racism is a public health crisis. Racism kills, and its impact on health inequities and disparities cannot be ignored. Black Americans suffer from higher rates of health issues, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, which are linked to social determinants such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to healthy food. The stress of discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, and racism contributes to the high maternal and infant mortality rate. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposes these injustices, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Structural racism has long oppressed the African American community, and it is our responsibility to address its harmful effects on health and well-being. We must confront systemic racism and push for policy changes to create a more just society.
