SUMMARY: The article discusses how racism is a public health crisis, highlighting the disproportionate impact of police violence and the underlying health conditions that contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality among Black Americans. The social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education and healthy food, play a significant role in creating health inequities. Racism itself is a stressor that negatively impacts health, leading to high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. The author emphasizes the need to acknowledge and address systemic racism and its detrimental effects on the health and well-being of the African American community.
