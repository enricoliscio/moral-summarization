Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about racism being a public health crisis, so "racism" is definitely a moral term. It mentions police violence killing black Americans at a higher rate, so "violence" and "killing" are moral. The term "underlying health conditions" is used to deflect blame, so "deflect" and "blame" are moral. "Cruel" is used to describe the situation, so that's another one. 

The article discusses health disparities, so "disparities" is moral. It mentions communities of color facing vast disparities in job opportunities, income, wealth, housing security, access to quality schools, healthy food, and green spaces. So "disparities," "opportunity," "income," "wealth," "housing security," "access," "quality," "schools," "healthy food," and "green spaces" all carry moral weight.

Chronic stress caused by discrimination leads to adverse health outcomes, so "stress," "discrimination," "adverse," and "outcomes" are moral. It talks about maternal and infant mortality rates, so "mortality" is moral. The pandemic has exposed inequities, so "exposed" and "inequities" are moral. The article mentions that black counties have higher infection and death rates, so "infection" and "death" are moral. Essential workers are more likely to contract the disease, so "essential workers" and "contract" are moral. 

Worse care when they fall ill, so "worse care" is moral. Underlying health conditions make the coronavirus deadly, so "deadly" is moral. Long-term air pollution exposure and its link to coronavirus deaths, so "pollution," "exposure," and "link" are moral. Black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, so "likely" and "polluting" are moral. Higher death rate from asthma and covid-19, so "higher death rate" is moral.

James Baldwin's quote about facing change, so "facing," "change," and "acknowledge" are moral. Systemic racism's impact on the African American community, so "systemic," "impact," and "community" are moral. Responsibility to acknowledge and address, so "responsibility," "address," and "policy change" are moral.

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible without making it too long. I should focus on the main points: racism as a public health crisis, police violence, health disparities, the pandemic's impact, and the call for policy change.

I should start by stating that racism is a public health crisis, mention police violence, the role of underlying health conditions, and how systemic racism affects health outcomes. Then, discuss the pandemic's role in exposing these inequities, the higher rates of infection and death among black communities, and the need for policy change.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate.
