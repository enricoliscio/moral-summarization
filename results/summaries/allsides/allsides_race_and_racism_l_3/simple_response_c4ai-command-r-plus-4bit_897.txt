SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, brings to light the stark reality of racism as a public health crisis. Racism kills black Americans at a higher rate through police violence and underlying health conditions, exacerbated by systemic racism and social determinants. These determinants include disparities in job opportunities, income, housing security, access to quality education and healthy food, and exposure to air pollution, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease. Racism itself causes chronic stress, impacting mental and physical health. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposes these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. It is imperative to recognize the deadly impact of systemic racism and work towards meaningful policy changes to address these health disparities.
