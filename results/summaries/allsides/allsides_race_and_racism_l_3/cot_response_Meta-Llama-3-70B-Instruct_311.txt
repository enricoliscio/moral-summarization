SUMMARY:
Racism is a public health crisis, and the recent death of George Floyd is a visceral reminder of this reality. The police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans is a cruel and ironic consequence of systemic racism. The underlying health conditions that contributed to Floyd's death, such as diabetes and hypertension, are also deadly consequences of racism. Chronic stress caused by discrimination can trigger a cascade of adverse health outcomes, from high blood pressure and heart disease to immunodeficiency and accelerated aging. The covid-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of covid-related death as white counties. It is time to face the immutable fact that systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and we have a responsibility to acknowledge it and address it with meaningful policy change.
