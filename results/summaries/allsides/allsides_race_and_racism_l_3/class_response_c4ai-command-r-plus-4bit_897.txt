SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd has brought to light the persistent issue of racism in the United States, specifically the systemic racism that has long harmed the African American community. Racism is a public health crisis, with black Americans facing higher rates of deadly health issues such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease. The legacy of slavery and discrimination contributes to these health inequities, as well as disparities in job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces. Racism itself is harmful to health, causing chronic stress that leads to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. It is crucial to acknowledge the impact of systemic racism and address the underlying conditions that perpetuate these injustices. We must not let this moment pass without demanding meaningful policy changes to address these issues and uphold justice for all.
