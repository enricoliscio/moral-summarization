SUMMARY:
The police violence that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans is a visceral reminder that racism is a public health crisis. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease among black Americans. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, and racism itself is hard on a person's health. The covid-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with predominantly black counties seeing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of covid-related death as white counties. It is time to face the immutable fact that systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and all of us have a responsibility to acknowledge it and address it with meaningful policy change.
