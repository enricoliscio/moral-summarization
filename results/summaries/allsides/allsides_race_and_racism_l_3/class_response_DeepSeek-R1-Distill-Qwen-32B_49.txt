Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how racism is a public health crisis, affecting everything from police violence to health disparities. The author mentions specific issues like higher rates of certain diseases among Black Americans, structural racism, and the impact of COVID-19. I need to make sure to include words like racism, crisis, violence, kills, discrimination, etc. I should condense the information without losing the moral emphasis. Maybe start by stating that racism is a public health crisis, then touch on police violence, health disparities, the role of social determinants, and the impact of COVID-19. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. Let me structure it: start with the main idea, then list key points with the moral terms, and end with the call to action. I should ensure that each sentence includes at least one of the framed words. Also, I need to avoid markdown and keep the summary clear and impactful. Let me draft it, making sure to hit all the key points and maintain the moral tone.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that racism is a public health crisis, evident in police violence that disproportionately kills Black Americans and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine. It points out that underlying health conditions, often tied to systemic racism, contribute to inequities in health outcomes. Black Americans face higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, driven by social determinants like housing insecurity, limited access to quality education, and environmental hazards. Racism itself causes chronic stress, leading to health issues like high blood pressure and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities, with Black and brown communities facing higher infection and death rates, partly due to their overrepresentation among essential workers and exposure to pollution. The author emphasizes the need to address systemic racism and its impact on health, urging meaningful policy change to combat these inequities and achieve justice. END OF SUMMARY.
