Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified to keep as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses how racism is a public health crisis, particularly focusing on police violence against Black Americans. It mentions higher death rates and underlying health conditions. It also ties in historical issues like slavery and discrimination, which contribute to health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, showing higher infection and death rates among Black communities.

I should start by highlighting that racism is a public health crisis. Then, mention police violence and the higher death rates. Next, address the underlying health conditions and how they're linked to systemic racism. Include the pandemic's impact, higher rates of infection and death, and the role of essential workers.

I need to use words like racism, crisis, violence, kills, slavery, discrimination, death, homicide, deflect, stress, outcomes, justice, address. I'll structure the summary to flow from the main issue to its effects, ensuring each key point is covered concisely.

Let me draft a summary that captures all these elements without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure each moral term is included where appropriate, maintaining the original's tone and emphasis on systemic issues and the need for change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that racism is a public health crisis, evident in police violence that kills Black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. It underscores how systemic racism, rooted in slavery and discrimination, perpetuates health inequities, such as higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease among Black communities. The use of "underlying health conditions" to deflect blame from police violence is criticized, as it ignores the role of racism in creating these disparities. Chronic stress from discrimination leads to adverse health outcomes, including immunodeficiency and accelerated aging. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with Black counties experiencing three times the infection rate and six times the death rate of white counties. Black and brown essential workers face higher risks of contracting the virus and receiving worse care. Air pollution, disproportionately affecting Black communities, further contributes to health disparities. The article calls for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism to drive meaningful policy change and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
