SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that disproportionately affects Black Americans, as well as in the persistent health disparities between Black and white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination perpetuates health inequities, including higher rates of chronic diseases, obesity, and sleep deprivation among Black Americans. Social determinants, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality schools and healthcare, also contribute to these health disparities. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black Americans facing higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. It is imperative to acknowledge systemic racism and its impact on health, and to press for meaningful policy change to address these injustices.
