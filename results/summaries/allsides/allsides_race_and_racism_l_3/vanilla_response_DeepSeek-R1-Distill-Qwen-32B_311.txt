Alright, I need to summarize this article about racism as a public health crisis. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by mentioning the death of George Floyd and how it highlights systemic racism in public health. It talks about how black Americans are killed by police at a higher rate than whites. Then it discusses how underlying health conditions, which are more prevalent among black Americans, are often cited as contributing factors in such deaths, but this deflects from the real issue of racism.

The article goes on to explain that black Americans have higher rates of diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma compared to whites. It attributes this to social determinants like job opportunities, income, housing, and access to healthy food and education. Racism itself causes chronic stress, leading to health issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these inequities worse, with black counties having higher infection and death rates. Black essential workers are at higher risk, and they receive worse healthcare even when controlling for socioeconomic factors.

The article also mentions air pollution, noting that black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to higher asthma rates and COVID-19 deaths. It ends by emphasizing the need to address systemic racism and push for policy changes.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: police violence, health disparities, social determinants, chronic stress, COVID-19 impact, and the call for action against systemic racism.

SUMMARY: The article highlights systemic racism as a public health crisis, evident in higher rates of police violence against Black Americans and disparities in health outcomes. Black individuals face higher rates of chronic diseases, partly due to social determinants like limited access to quality education, housing, and healthcare. Racism itself causes chronic stress, contributing to health issues. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these inequities, with Black communities experiencing higher infection and death rates, partly due to disproportionate exposure to air pollution and inadequate healthcare. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and implementing policy changes to address these disparities. END OF SUMMARY.
