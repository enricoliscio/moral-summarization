SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd has brought to light the pervasive issue of racism in the United States, specifically the public health crisis it poses. Racism kills black Americans at a higher rate than white Americans through police violence and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine. The social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education and healthy food, contribute to health inequities and disparities between communities of color and their white counterparts. Racism itself is detrimental to a person's health, causing chronic stress that leads to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. It is crucial to acknowledge the systemic racism that has been hurting and cutting short the lives of African Americans and to address it through meaningful policy change. We must face the reality of racism and take responsibility for creating a more just and equitable society.
