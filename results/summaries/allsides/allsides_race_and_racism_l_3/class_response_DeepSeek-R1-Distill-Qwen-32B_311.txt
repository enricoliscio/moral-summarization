Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific instructions. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The author is talking about racism as a public health crisis, pointing out how it affects black Americans through higher rates of certain diseases, police violence, and systemic issues like access to resources.

I notice the author uses strong moral terms like "racism," "crisis," "violence," "kills," etc. My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words. I should focus on the key points: police violence, health disparities, underlying conditions, COVID-19 impact, and the call for justice.

I need to structure the summary to first state that racism is a public health crisis, mention police violence, then discuss health inequities, touch on COVID-19's disproportionate effect, and end with the call to action for addressing systemic racism.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and includes all the moral framing words. I'll start with the main idea, then list the consequences, and conclude with the necessity for change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact on black Americans through police violence, higher rates of chronic diseases, and systemic inequities. Racism perpetuates disparities in housing, education, and healthcare, contributing to conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Black and brown essential workers face increased exposure, while underlying health conditions, often rooted in structural racism, make them more vulnerable. The article underscores how racism itself causes chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes, including maternal and infant mortality. It calls for acknowledging and addressing systemic racism to drive meaningful policy change and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
