Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about racism as a public health crisis, police violence, health disparities, and systemic issues like slavery and discrimination. The author connects these to underlying health conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Black communities. 

I should start by identifying the key moral terms: racism, crisis, violence, kills, slavery, discrimination, cruel, death, homicide, actions, inequities, disparities, immunodeficiency, mortality, care, underlying, responsibility, address, hurting, cutting, justice, fade. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll structure it by highlighting the main points: racism as a public health crisis, the impact of police violence, health disparities, the role of social determinants, and the COVID-19 pandemic's exacerbation of these issues. I'll also mention the call for justice and systemic change.

I should ensure that each paragraph flows logically, connecting the moral issues to the health outcomes. I'll avoid technical jargon to keep it accessible but make sure all the specified terms are included. Let me draft the summary, making sure to cover each point succinctly and include the moral framing words.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact on Black Americans. Police violence, historical slavery, and discrimination contribute to higher rates of health disparities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These conditions are exacerbated by systemic racism, which denies access to quality healthcare, education, and housing. Chronic stress from discrimination further harms health, leading to conditions like immunodeficiency and high mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black communities facing higher infection and death rates. Black Americans are more likely to work essential jobs, live near polluting facilities, and suffer from underlying health conditions, all of which increase vulnerability to the virus. The author calls for acknowledging systemic racism and taking responsibility to address these injustices through policy change, ensuring justice is not allowed to fade.  
END OF SUMMARY.
