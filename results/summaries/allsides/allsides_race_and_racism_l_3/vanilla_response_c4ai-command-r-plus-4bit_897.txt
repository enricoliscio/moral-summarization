SUMMARY: The article discusses how racism is a public health crisis, highlighting the police violence that disproportionately kills Black Americans and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine and social determinants of health. It also addresses the role of racism in underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, which are more prevalent in Black communities. The social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education, food, and green spaces, contribute to health inequities. Racism itself is harmful to health, causing chronic stress that can lead to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. The article concludes by calling for acknowledgment and action to address systemic racism and its detrimental effects on the health of the African American community.
