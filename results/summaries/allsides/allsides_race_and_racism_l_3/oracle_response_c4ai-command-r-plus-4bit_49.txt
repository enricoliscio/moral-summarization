SUMMARY: The recent tragic events have brought to light the pervasive issue of racism and its devastating impact on public health. Racism, a public health crisis, is evident in police violence, with black Americans dying at a much higher rate than white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, contributing to higher rates of underlying health conditions in black communities. Structural racism and discrimination cause chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Black Americans are more likely to be essential workers and face environmental injustices, such as living near polluting facilities, contributing to higher asthma death rates. We must acknowledge the systemic racism that has long oppressed the African American community and address the health disparities it causes. We have the tools to identify and address these entrenched issues and must push for policy changes to achieve justice and improve health outcomes for marginalized communities.
