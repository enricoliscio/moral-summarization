SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that disproportionately affects Black Americans, as well as in the systemic inequalities in healthcare and social determinants of health. The recent death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, highlights the role of racism in underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which are more prevalent among Black Americans. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with Black Americans facing higher rates of infection and death. It is imperative to acknowledge and address systemic racism, which has been suffocating the African American community since America's inception. We have the tools to identify the ways in which discrimination hurts health and cuts lives short; it is time to face this reality and press for meaningful policy change.
