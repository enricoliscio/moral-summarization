SUMMARY:

The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis, particularly in the context of police violence and systemic discrimination. The death of George Floyd is a stark reminder of the deadly impact of racism on the health of black Americans. The article cites statistics showing that black Americans suffer from higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, due to social determinants like job opportunities, income, and access to quality schools, healthy food, and green spaces. Racism itself is also a significant contributor to adverse health outcomes, including chronic stress, high blood pressure, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these health inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. The article concludes that it is time to acknowledge and address systemic racism, using the tools available to identify and address the ways in which discrimination is hurting health and cutting lives short.
