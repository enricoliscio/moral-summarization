SUMMARY:

The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis, particularly in the context of police violence and systemic inequalities in healthcare. Black Americans are killed by police at nearly three times the rate of white Americans, and they suffer from higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. The article argues that these health disparities are rooted in social determinants such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education and healthcare. Racism itself is also a significant contributor to poor health outcomes, causing chronic stress and adverse health effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. The article concludes that it is essential to acknowledge and address systemic racism to address these health disparities and promote meaningful policy change.
