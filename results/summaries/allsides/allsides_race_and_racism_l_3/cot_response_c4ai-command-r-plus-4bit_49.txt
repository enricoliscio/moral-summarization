SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis that has been gut-wrenching and visible in the United States for generations. The cruel and ironic reality is that racism is a key driver of health disparities across the country, undermining the well-being of communities of color. The consequences of systemic racism and discrimination are well-documented, and the chronic stress they cause can trigger a range of adverse health outcomes. The racism endured by Black Americans contributes to alarmingly high maternal and infant mortality rates and disproportionately impacts their physical health, as seen in the striking link between air pollution exposure and coronavirus deaths. It is undeniable that racism is hurting the health and well-being of Black Americans, cutting lives short, and perpetuating inequities that must be addressed through meaningful policy change.
