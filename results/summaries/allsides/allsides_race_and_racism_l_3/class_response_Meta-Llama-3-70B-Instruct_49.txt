SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis that kills black Americans at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. Police violence, a gut-wrenching reality, is just one manifestation of this crisis. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine, perpetuating health inequities. The underlying health conditions of black Americans, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, are exacerbated by racism, which also causes chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these inequities, with black counties experiencing three times the rate of infection and six times the rate of COVID-related death as white counties. Black and brown Americans are disproportionately affected, receiving worse care and suffering from underlying health conditions that make the coronavirus deadly. It is time to face the immutable fact that systemic racism has had its knee on the neck of the African American community since America began, and we have a responsibility to acknowledge and address it.
