SUMMARY:

Racism is a public health crisis, evident in the police violence that disproportionately affects Black Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of chronic diseases, obesity, and insufficient sleep among Black Americans. The role of racism in these underlying conditions cannot be denied, and chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. Black and brown Americans are more likely to be essential workers, contract the disease, and receive worse care. The striking link between air pollution exposure and coronavirus deaths further highlights the systemic racism that has had a devastating impact on the African American community. It is time to face this reality and acknowledge the responsibility to address it through meaningful policy change.
