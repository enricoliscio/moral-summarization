SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd, ruled as a homicide, has brought to light the stark reality of systemic racism in the United States and its devastating impact on the health and well-being of African Americans. Racism, a public health crisis, manifests in police brutality and the persistent legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The underlying health conditions that contribute to the high mortality rates among African Americans are a result of generations of disparities in job opportunities, income, housing security, access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces. Racism itself is a health risk factor, causing chronic stress and adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. It is crucial to acknowledge the deadly impact of systemic racism and address the entrenched discrimination that continues to harm the health and shorten the lives of African Americans.
