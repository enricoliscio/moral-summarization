SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd, ruled as a homicide, brings to light the stark reality of racism as a public health crisis in the United States. The underlying health conditions that contributed to Floyd's death highlight the deadly consequences of systemic racism. Black Americans face higher rates of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, which are linked to social determinants of health, including job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education, nutritious food, and green spaces. Racism itself is a health risk factor, causing chronic stress that leads to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposes these health inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and society, and it is imperative to recognize and address systemic racism as a critical public health issue. The time has come to confront and dismantle the systemic racism that has oppressed the African American community since the nation's inception.
