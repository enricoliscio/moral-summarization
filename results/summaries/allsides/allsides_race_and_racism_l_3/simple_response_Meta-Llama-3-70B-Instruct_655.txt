SUMMARY:

The killing of George Floyd is a stark reminder that racism is a public health crisis. Systemic racism is embedded in the social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health issues, and mortality among Black Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine, and racism itself is a significant contributor to poor health outcomes. Chronic stress caused by discrimination triggers adverse health outcomes, and evidence suggests that racism endured by Black mothers contributes to high maternal and infant mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. It is time to acknowledge the role of systemic racism in perpetuating health disparities and to press for meaningful policy change to address these injustices.
