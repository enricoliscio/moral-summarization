SUMMARY: The tragic death of George Floyd, ruled as a homicide, brings to light the pervasive issue of racism in the United States, particularly its impact on public health. Racism is a public health crisis, evident in police brutality, the legacy of slavery and discrimination in medicine, and health inequities. The higher rates of chronic diseases and adverse health outcomes among Black Americans are linked to the social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces. Racism itself is harmful to health, causing chronic stress and adverse health effects. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposes these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. It is crucial to acknowledge the systemic racism that has historically disadvantaged African Americans and address its harmful impact on health through meaningful policy changes.
