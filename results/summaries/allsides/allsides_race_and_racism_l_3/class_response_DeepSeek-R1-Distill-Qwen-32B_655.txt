Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand all the requirements.

The user provided a detailed article about racism as a public health crisis, highlighting various issues like police violence, health disparities, and systemic racism. They also listed specific morally framed words that need to be included in the summary. The task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using those words as much as possible.

First, I should identify the main points of the article. The author is emphasizing that racism is a public health crisis, pointing out higher rates of police violence against Black Americans, underlying health conditions, and systemic issues like disparities in jobs, housing, and education. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with higher infection and death rates among Black and Brown communities. The article also mentions the impact of air pollution and the responsibility to address these issues.

Now, I need to make sure to include the listed moral words: Racism, crisis, violence, kills, slavery, discrimination, cruel, death, homicide, actions, racism, inequities, disparities, immunodeficiency, mortality, care, underlying, responsibility, address, hurting, cutting, justice, fade.

I'll start by stating that the article frames racism as a public health crisis. Then, mention police violence and the higher death rates. Next, discuss the underlying health conditions and how they're linked to systemic racism. Include the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, disparities in essential workers, and healthcare. Highlight the role of air pollution and its effects on asthma and COVID mortality. Finally, stress the responsibility to address these issues and not let the call for justice fade.

I should ensure the summary flows well, connects each point logically, and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it and then check the word count and the inclusion of the moral terms.

SUMMARY: The article frames racism as a public health crisis, emphasizing its deadly impact on Black Americans. Police violence, which kills Black individuals at nearly three times the rate of whites, underscores this crisis. Racism also manifests in higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma among Black communities, driven by structural disparities in housing, education, and access to healthy environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, with Black and Brown communities facing higher infection and death rates, partly due to their disproportionate representation among essential workers and underlying health conditions. Air pollution, which Black Americans are more likely to endure, further contributes to health risks, including asthma and COVID-19 mortality. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and taking responsibility to address these injustices, urging meaningful policy change to combat the enduring impact of discrimination and ensure equitable care. The phrase “I can’t breathe” serves as a poignant reminder of the urgent need to confront and act against systemic racism before the call for justice fades. END OF SUMMARY.
