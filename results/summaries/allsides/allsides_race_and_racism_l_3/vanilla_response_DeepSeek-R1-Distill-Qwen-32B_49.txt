Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about racism as a public health crisis, especially in the context of George Floyd's death. It mentions police violence and how black Americans are killed at a higher rate than white Americans. Then it discusses the underlying health conditions that disproportionately affect black communities, like diabetes and hypertension. 

The article also connects this to historical issues like slavery and discrimination in medicine. It points out that using "underlying health conditions" as an excuse is a way to deflect blame from police officers. It also talks about social determinants of health, such as job opportunities, housing, and access to healthy food, which are worse for communities of color. 

Chronic stress from racism leads to health issues like high blood pressure and heart disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these disparities, with black counties having higher infection and death rates. Black and brown people are more likely to be essential workers and have worse healthcare outcomes. 

The article also mentions air pollution, with black Americans more likely to live near polluting facilities, contributing to higher asthma and COVID-19 death rates. It ends by emphasizing the need to address systemic racism and push for policy changes.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating that racism is a public health crisis, mention George Floyd and police violence, then the health disparities. I'll include the social determinants and chronic stress effects. Then touch on COVID-19 disparities, air pollution, and the call for systemic change. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points.

SUMMARY: The article highlights racism as a public health crisis, particularly evident in police violence against Black Americans and health disparities. Black individuals face higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, exacerbated by structural racism and social determinants such as limited access to quality education, housing, and healthcare. Chronic stress from discrimination contributes to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with Black and brown communities disproportionately affected due to higher rates of underlying health conditions, essential worker roles, and worse healthcare access. Additionally, Black Americans are more likely to live near polluting facilities, increasing their risk of respiratory issues and COVID-19 mortality. The article calls for acknowledging systemic racism and advocating for policy changes to address these disparities. END OF SUMMARY.
