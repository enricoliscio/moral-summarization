SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the stark racial inequities in health outcomes for Black Americans. Racism is a public health crisis, and its impact is visible in police violence, the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine, and social determinants of health. Black Americans face higher rates of chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and heart disease, which are influenced by social determinants like job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to healthy food and green spaces. Structural racism and personal experiences of racism contribute to chronic stress, leading to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlights these disparities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. Black Americans are also disproportionately represented among essential workers and are more likely to live near polluting facilities, impacting their respiratory health. Addressing systemic racism and its impact on health is crucial, and meaningful policy changes are needed to create equitable health outcomes.
