SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, ruled a homicide, is a visceral reminder that racism is a public health crisis. Racism kills black Americans at a higher rate through police violence and the legacy of slavery and discrimination in modern medicine and social determinants of health. The role of racism in underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, cannot be denied. Social determinants, including job opportunities, income, housing security, and access to quality education, food, and green spaces, contribute to health inequities. Racism itself is hard on a person's health, causing chronic stress that leads to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. It is crucial to acknowledge the systemic racism that has long oppressed the African American community and to address the harmful effects of entrenched discrimination on health and lives. We must press for meaningful policy change to address these injustices.
