SUMMARY:

The article highlights the reality of racism as a public health crisis in the United States. The police violence that disproportionately affects black Americans is a stark reminder of this crisis. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease among black Americans. Racism itself is a significant contributor to these health inequities, causing chronic stress that can trigger adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. The article emphasizes the need to acknowledge systemic racism and address it through policy change to improve health outcomes and promote justice.
