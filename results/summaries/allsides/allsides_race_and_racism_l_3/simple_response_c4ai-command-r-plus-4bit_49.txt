SUMMARY: Racism is a public health crisis, and the recent events surrounding the death of George Floyd have brought this issue to the forefront once again. The underlying health conditions that contributed to Floyd's death, as some claim, are themselves a result of systemic racism and its impact on social determinants of health. Black Americans face disparities in job opportunities, income, housing security, access to quality education and healthy food, and exposure to air pollution, all of which impact their physical and mental well-being. Racism itself is a stressor that negatively affects health, contributing to high blood pressure, heart disease, and even maternal and infant mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. It is crucial to recognize the deadly impact of systemic racism and to address the entrenched discrimination that continues to harm the health and well-being of the African American community.
