SUMMARY: The killing of George Floyd is a stark reminder of the public health crisis that is racism. Police violence, a manifestation of systemic racism, disproportionately affects Black Americans, who are killed at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The legacy of slavery and discrimination persists in modern medicine and social determinants of health, leading to higher rates of chronic diseases, obesity, and insufficient sleep among Black Americans. Racism itself is a deadly force, causing chronic stress that triggers adverse health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and immunodeficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these inequities, with predominantly Black counties experiencing higher rates of infection and death. It is our responsibility to acknowledge and address the role of systemic racism in perpetuating health inequities and cutting lives short. We must press for meaningful policy change to ensure justice and equality for all. END OF SUMMARY.
