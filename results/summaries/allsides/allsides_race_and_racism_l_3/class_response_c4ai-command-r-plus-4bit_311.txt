SUMMARY: The death of George Floyd, ruled as a homicide, brings to light the stark reality of racism as a public health crisis. The underlying health conditions that contributed to Floyd's death highlight the deadly impact of racism. Black Americans suffer from higher rates of chronic diseases and face social inequities due to structural racism and discrimination. These disparities in job opportunities, income, housing, and access to quality education, healthy food, and green spaces undermine their mental and physical well-being. Racism itself is a stressor that adversely affects health, leading to high blood pressure, heart disease, immunodeficiency, and accelerated aging. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposes these inequities, with predominantly black counties experiencing higher infection and death rates. The systemic racism that has plagued the African American community since the nation's inception must be acknowledged and addressed. It is our responsibility to recognize the entrenched discrimination that continues to harm the health and shorten the lives of Black Americans. We must seize this moment to push for meaningful policy changes that address these injustices.
END OF SUMMARY.
