SUMMARY: Despite promising progress on several vaccine candidates, experts argue that there are significant reasons to remain skeptical about the idea that a coronavirus vaccine is just a few months away. Developing a vaccine by early next year would already shatter records for the fastest vaccine ever developed, and drug companies will still need to produce and distribute hundreds of millions of doses. There are concerns that investing too much hope in a best-case scenario could lead to a lack of preparation for the possibility that it may take years before a vaccine is widely available. Rushing the development of a vaccine may also backfire and increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, potentially increasing anti-vaccine sentiment and undermining herd immunity. Some argue that waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary deaths, as there are mitigation measures that can be implemented now to reduce the spread of the virus. Experts say that a vaccine is still the best path out of the pandemic, but it won't be a magic solution, and there are challenges ahead in ensuring its effectiveness, distribution, and public acceptance.
