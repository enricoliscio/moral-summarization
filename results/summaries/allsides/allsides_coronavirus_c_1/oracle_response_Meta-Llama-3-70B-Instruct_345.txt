SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is widely considered the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that rushing development may lead to an unsafe vaccine, and that investing too much in a best-case scenario may divert attention from necessary mitigation measures. Others argue that preparing for a longer timeline would allow for the development of effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The author notes that vaccine skepticism may hinder efforts to reach herd immunity, and that the supply chain for vaccine materials could break down. The article concludes that waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary deaths, and that policymakers should focus on reducing cases and deaths now rather than relying on a future vaccine.
