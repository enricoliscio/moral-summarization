Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the efforts like Operation Warp Speed, and the cautious optimism from experts. It also highlights the challenges and debates around vaccine development, distribution, and public trust.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words provided: establish, deaths, tracing, therapeutic, mitigation, undermine, break, bottlenecks, hoarding, banking, dying, hobbled, tragedy, reduce. I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to cover the key points: the importance of a vaccine for herd immunity, the skepticism about the timeline, the risks of rushing, the need for testing and tracing, the potential for public distrust, and the tragedy of current deaths while waiting for a vaccine.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is covered and the words are appropriately used.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all the required words are included and that the moral framing is preserved as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity, preventing millions of deaths. While Operation Warp Speed aims to have millions of doses ready by the end of the year, experts remain skeptical about the timeline, as developing a vaccine in record time could lead to bottlenecks in production and distribution. Some worry that rushing vaccine development might result in an unsafe product, undermining public trust and exacerbating anti-vaccine sentiment. Others argue that focusing too much on a future vaccine could divert attention from immediate mitigation efforts, such as testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures, which are critical to reducing cases and deaths now. The tragedy of the current situation lies in the fact that people are dying and the economy is hobbled while waiting for a miracle cure. A vaccine is not a magic solution, but it remains the best path out of the pandemic, though challenges like hoarding and supply chain issues must be addressed to ensure equitable distribution. END OF SUMMARY.
