SUMMARY:

The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021, experts warn that rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and undermining herd immunity. Moreover, relying solely on a vaccine may distract from implementing necessary mitigation measures to reduce cases and deaths now. The supply chain for vaccine materials could also break down, slowing down vaccine availability. Experts argue that a better plan would be to prepare for a longer timeline, developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. Vaccine skepticism may further hinder reaching herd immunity. Ultimately, waiting for a miracle cure in the future is causing unnecessary deaths right now, and policymakers should focus on reducing cases and deaths immediately.
