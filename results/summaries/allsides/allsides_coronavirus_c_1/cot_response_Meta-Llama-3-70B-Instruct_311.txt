SUMMARY:
The development of an effective vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish "herd immunity" and end the coronavirus pandemic. Despite promising progress, experts are "cautiously optimistic" about having a vaccine ready by early 2021. However, there are significant reasons to be "skeptical" about the idea that a game-changing vaccine is just a few months away. Developing a vaccine by the end of the year would shatter the record for the fastest vaccine ever developed, and even then, production and distribution would be a major challenge. Some argue that investing too much in a "best-case scenario" may be holding back efforts to implement necessary virus mitigation measures. Moreover, rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an "unsafe" vaccine and fueling "pervasive" anti-vaccine sentiment. A more "hopeful" approach would be to prepare for a longer timeline and develop effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. END OF SUMMARY.
