SUMMARY: 
There is a common *accepted* truth that the coronavirus pandemic will only end with an effective vaccine. While there is promising progress on some vaccine candidates, experts urge *skepticism* about the idea that a vaccine is just months away. Developing a safe and effective vaccine in such a short time frame would be an *extraordinary* feat, and even if accomplished, distribution challenges remain. Some worry about *investing* too much hope in a *best-case* scenario, arguing that a more realistic plan is to prepare for the possibility that a vaccine could take years. There are concerns that *rushed* development may *backfire*, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and potentially *undermining* public trust. Additionally, any new vaccine may not be entirely effective or provide long-lasting immunity. Despite these challenges, a vaccine remains the best path out of the pandemic, offering *hopeful* prospects for the future. However, the *tragedy* is that in the meantime, unnecessary deaths continue to occur while some policymakers wait for a miracle cure.
