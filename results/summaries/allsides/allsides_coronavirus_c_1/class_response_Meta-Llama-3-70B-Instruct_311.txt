SUMMARY: The development of an effective vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic. However, experts warn that the effort to develop a vaccine by the end of the year may be overly optimistic, and that waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary deaths right now. The process of developing a vaccine is complex, and even if a vaccine is developed quickly, producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses will be a significant challenge. Moreover, rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and undermining herd immunity. Instead of banking on a future vaccine, policymakers should focus on implementing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines to mitigate the spread of the virus. The tragedy is that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths right now, but it is being overlooked in favor of a potential future solution. END OF SUMMARY.
