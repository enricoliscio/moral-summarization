SUMMARY:
The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021, experts warn that it may take years before a vaccine is widely available. Rushing development may lead to an unsafe vaccine, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment and undermining herd immunity. Others argue that investing too much in a best-case scenario may distract from developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The focus should be on preparing for a longer timeline, rather than waiting on a "miracle cure" that may arrive too late. It's a "tragic" reality that people are dying now, and policymakers should focus on reducing cases and deaths immediately, rather than banking on a future vaccine. END OF SUMMARY.
