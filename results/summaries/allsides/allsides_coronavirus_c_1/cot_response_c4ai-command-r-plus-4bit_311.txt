SUMMARY:
The development of a vaccine is widely seen as the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. While there is promising progress, experts urge skepticism about the timeline for a vaccine. Developing one by early 2021 would shatter records, and production and distribution challenges remain. Some argue that investing too much hope in a best-case scenario could backfire by increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first. Any setbacks risk undermining herd immunity by feeding pervasive vaccine skepticism. While a vaccine won't be a magic solution, it's still the best path forward. However, waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary deaths as effective systems of testing, tracing, and treatment are not being prioritized. There are enormous challenges and ethical dilemmas ahead, but there is also much to be hopeful about.
