SUMMARY:

The development of a COVID-19 vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and potentially undermining herd immunity. Moreover, relying solely on a vaccine may divert attention from necessary mitigation measures, such as testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The supply chain for vaccine materials could also break down, slowing down vaccine availability. Some argue that waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary deaths, and that policymakers should focus on reducing cases and deaths now, rather than banking on a future vaccine. END OF SUMMARY.
