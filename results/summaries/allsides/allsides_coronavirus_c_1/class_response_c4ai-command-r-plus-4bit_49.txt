SUMMARY: Despite promising progress on several vaccine candidates, experts warn against being overly optimistic about a coronavirus vaccine being ready in a few months. Developing a safe and effective vaccine at such a rapid pace is unprecedented, and distributing hundreds of millions of doses to the people who need them will be a significant challenge. Investing too much hope in a best-case scenario could hinder efforts to implement necessary virus mitigation measures, such as testing and tracing. Rushing development may also increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, which could undermine herd immunity efforts by increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks and hoarding could slow down vaccine availability, as could production challenges. The alternative to a vaccine is to let the virus run its course, which could lead to millions of deaths. While a vaccine won't be a magic solution, it still offers the best path out of the pandemic. It's important to balance optimism with realism and continue focusing on therapeutic measures and other strategies to reduce the impact of the virus until a vaccine is widely available.
