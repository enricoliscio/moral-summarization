Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the challenges involved, and the moral implications of relying too much on a vaccine. 

First, I'll note the key points: over 100 vaccines in development, Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Fauci's cautious optimism, herd immunity, potential risks like unsafe vaccines, and the need for current mitigation measures. 

I need to make sure to include words like "establish," "deaths," "tracing," "therapeutic," "mitigation," "undermine," "break," "bottlenecks," "hoarding," "banking," "dying," "hobbled," "tragedy," and "reduce." 

I'll structure the summary to highlight the hope of a vaccine but also the risks and the importance of current measures. I'll ensure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, checking each moral term as I go.

SUMMARY: The race for a COVID-19 vaccine is a global effort with over 100 candidates in development, some in human trials. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims for millions of doses by year-end, with Dr. Anthony Fauci cautiously optimistic for early 2021 availability. Establishing herd immunity through a vaccine is seen as the quickest and safest path, avoiding the tragedy of millions of deaths from natural spread. However, skepticism remains about the feasibility of developing and distributing a vaccine within months, given the complexity and potential bottlenecks in production and distribution. Experts warn that rushing vaccine development could undermine public trust if an unsafe product is released, exacerbating anti-vaccine sentiment. Additionally, relying too heavily on a vaccine may hinder efforts to implement effective mitigation measures now, such as testing, tracing, and therapeutic treatments. The tragedy of delayed action could lead to unnecessary deaths and a hobbled economy. A balanced approach, preparing for both vaccine success and long-term challenges, is crucial to reduce suffering and ensure equitable vaccine access. END OF SUMMARY.
