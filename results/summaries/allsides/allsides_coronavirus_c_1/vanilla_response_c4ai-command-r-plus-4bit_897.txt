SUMMARY: There are more than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines in development, with some already in human trials. Despite promising progress, experts caution that developing a safe and effective vaccine by early 2021 would be an unprecedented feat, and widespread distribution could take even longer. Some argue that over-optimism about a quick vaccine may hinder current mitigation efforts and increase anti-vaccine sentiment if setbacks occur. Others worry that the supply chain for vaccine materials could break down, causing delays. While a vaccine is the best path out of the pandemic, it won't be a magic solution, and effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines are still needed. Reaching herd immunity will also depend on vaccine skepticism, which may prove challenging.
