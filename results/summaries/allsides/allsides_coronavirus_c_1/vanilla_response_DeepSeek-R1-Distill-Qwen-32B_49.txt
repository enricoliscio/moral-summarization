Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the development of a coronavirus vaccine. It mentions that many vaccines are in various stages of development, with some already in human trials. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses by the end of the year, and Dr. Fauci is cautiously optimistic about early 2021. The goal is to achieve herd immunity, which would require about 70% of the population to be immune. The article also discusses the debate around the feasibility of developing a vaccine quickly and the potential challenges, such as production and distribution. Some experts worry about relying too much on a vaccine and suggest focusing on other measures like testing and tracing. There's also concern that skepticism about vaccines could hinder herd immunity, and that rushing development might lead to unsafe vaccines.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the global vaccine effort, the number of candidates, Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Fauci's optimism, the need for herd immunity, the debate about the timeline and challenges, and the concerns about skepticism and safety.

I'll start by stating the main goal of developing a vaccine for herd immunity. Then mention the efforts and progress, including Operation Warp Speed and Fauci's comments. Next, address the skepticism and challenges like production, distribution, and public trust. Finally, touch on the alternative measures suggested by experts and the risks of rushing the vaccine.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development, some in human trials. The U.S. government's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to produce millions of doses by the end of the year, while Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. Achieving herd immunity, which requires about 70% of the population to be immune, is the goal. However, experts caution against overoptimism, noting the unprecedented speed required to develop a vaccine and the challenges of production and distribution. Some argue that relying too heavily on a vaccine may delay efforts to implement current mitigation measures, while others warn of potential risks, such as public skepticism or unsafe vaccines. The debate highlights the need for alternative strategies, like testing and tracing, to reduce deaths and control the virus while waiting for a vaccine. END OF SUMMARY.
