Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. The article is about the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, the efforts involved, and the debates around it. 

First, I need to understand the user's requirements. They want a summary that includes the morally framed words: "said," "say," "mitigation," "rushing," and "break." I should make sure these words are included as much as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by reading the article to identify the main points. The article discusses the global effort to develop a vaccine, mentions Operation Warp Speed, experts' cautious optimism, the need for herd immunity, and the debate around skepticism, potential risks of rushing, and the importance of current mitigation measures.

Next, I need to extract the key moral points. The author uses words like "said" and "say" to present expert opinions, which adds credibility. "Mitigation" is used in the context of current measures, emphasizing their importance. "Rushing" refers to the potential risks of expedited vaccine development, which is a moral concern about safety. "Break" is used metaphorically in the sense of the vaccine being a solution but also possibly causing issues if mishandled.

I should structure the summary to include these elements. I'll mention the global efforts, the skepticism about the timeline, the risks of rushing, the need for mitigation measures, and the potential challenges in achieving herd immunity. I'll ensure that each of the morally framed words is included where appropriate.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and only includes the most important points. I'll check that the flow makes sense, starting with the efforts, moving to the skepticism, then the risks, the importance of current measures, and the challenges ahead.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets all the criteria: correct use of morally framed words, length, and proper structure. I'll make sure it's clear and accurately reflects the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of testing globally. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to deliver millions of doses by year-end, while Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. However, experts warn that achieving herd immunity through a vaccine is not guaranteed, and waiting for natural infection could lead to millions of deaths. Skepticism remains about the feasibility of developing a vaccine in record time, with concerns that rushing could result in an unsafe product or exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment. Some argue that relying too heavily on a vaccine may hinder current mitigation efforts, such as testing and tracing. The supply chain for vaccine distribution could also face bottlenecks, similar to those seen with medical supplies. While a vaccine is the best path forward, experts emphasize the need for realistic planning and continued efforts to address the pandemic in the near term. END OF SUMMARY.
