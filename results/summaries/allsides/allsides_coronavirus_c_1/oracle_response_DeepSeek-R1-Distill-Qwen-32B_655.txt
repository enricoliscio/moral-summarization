Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words: said, say, mitigation, rushing, and break. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the efforts like Operation Warp Speed, expert opinions on the timeline, and the challenges involved. The moral aspects include the potential risks of rushing, the impact on public sentiment, and the importance of mitigation measures.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the race for a vaccine, the skepticism about the timeline, the risks of rushing, the need for mitigation, and the possible consequences of setbacks. 

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes the required words. I'll mention the "commonly accepted truth" about the vaccine, the "cautiously optimistic" view from Dr. Fauci, the skepticism from experts, and the risks of rushing. I'll also highlight the importance of mitigation measures and the potential for public sentiment to break down if things go wrong.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally. I'll make sure to include all the morally framed words without forcing them in. 

Let me structure it: start with the main point, mention the experts' opinions, the skepticism, the risks, the need for mitigation, and the consequences. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The race for a coronavirus vaccine is a commonly accepted solution to ending the pandemic, with over 100 candidates in development and some in human trials. Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021, but experts warn that developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine in record time is highly uncertain. Rushing development could risk unsafe vaccines or public skepticism, potentially undermining herd immunity. Some argue that relying too much on a vaccine may delay efforts to implement necessary mitigation measures, such as testing and tracing. Others emphasize that a vaccine wonâ€™t be a magic solution but remains the best path forward. However, any setbacks could exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment, and the supply chain for vaccine materials might face bottlenecks, similar to medical supply shortages. Waiting for a miracle cure could also lead to unnecessary deaths and economic instability now. END OF SUMMARY.
