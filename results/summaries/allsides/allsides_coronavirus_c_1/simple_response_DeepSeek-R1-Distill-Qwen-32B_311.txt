Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the arguments presented.

The article is about the development of a coronavirus vaccine and the debates surrounding it. It starts by stating that a vaccine is the key to ending the pandemic, with many candidates in development and some in human trials. The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed aims for millions of doses by the end of the year, and Dr. Fauci is cautiously optimistic for early 2021. The article mentions herd immunity, which requires about 70% of the population to be immune, either through vaccination or infection. The latter option is dangerous as it could lead to millions of deaths.

Now, the debate part: experts are skeptical about a vaccine being ready soon. Developing a vaccine in under a year would break records, and even if successful, production and distribution on a large scale are challenges. Some worry that focusing too much on a quick vaccine might neglect current measures like testing, tracing, and treatments. Others fear that rushing could lead to an unsafe vaccine, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. There's also the possibility that the vaccine might not be entirely effective or long-lasting.

The perspectives section includes points like vaccine skepticism hindering herd immunity, the vaccine not being a magic solution but still the best hope, potential supply chain issues, and the danger of waiting for a vaccine while people are dying now.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. That means highlighting the optimism about the vaccine but also the risks and ethical concerns. I should mention the potential benefits, the challenges, and the moral implications of relying too much on a vaccine versus current measures.

I should structure the summary to first state the common belief in the vaccine, then the progress and optimism, followed by the skepticism and challenges, and end with the moral perspectives on the situation. Keeping it under 200 words and clear.

Let me draft this, making sure each point is concise and the moral aspects are emphasized.

SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 candidates in various stages of development, including human trials. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to deliver millions of doses by the end of 2020, with Dr. Anthony Fauci expressing cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. Herd immunity, achieved when about 70% of the population is immune, is the goal, but experts warn that waiting for natural infection could lead to millions of deaths. While progress is promising, skepticism remains about the feasibility of developing a safe and effective vaccine within months, given the complexity of production, distribution, and public acceptance. Some argue that over-reliance on a quick vaccine could divert attention from immediate measures like testing, tracing, and therapeutic treatments. Additionally, rushed development risks unsafe vaccines, which could exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment and undermine herd immunity. The moral debate centers on balancing hope for a vaccine with the urgent need to implement proven measures to save lives now. END OF SUMMARY.
