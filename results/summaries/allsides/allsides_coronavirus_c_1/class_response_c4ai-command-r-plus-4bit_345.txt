SUMMARY: Despite promising progress on developing a coronavirus vaccine, experts urge caution and emphasize the need for comprehensive solutions to the pandemic. The fastest vaccine ever developed took four years, and distributing hundreds of millions of doses to the people who need them is a monumental task. Investing too heavily in a best-case scenario could lead to setbacks and increase anti-vaccine sentiment, undermining efforts to establish herd immunity. The supply chain for vaccine materials could also break down, leading to production and distribution bottlenecks and hoarding. While waiting for a miracle cure, policymakers are witnessing unnecessary deaths and a hobbled economy. A comprehensive approach involving testing, tracing, therapeutic medicines, and mitigation measures is necessary to reduce cases and deaths. The development of a vaccine is not a magic solution, but it offers a path out of the pandemic.
