SUMMARY: There is a race against the clock to develop a coronavirus vaccine, with over 100 potential vaccines in development and the Trump administration aiming for millions of doses by the end of the year. While a vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and bring an end to the pandemic, experts warn that the process of developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine at such a scale has never been done before and could face significant setbacks. There are concerns about investing too heavily in a best-case scenario, and the potential for anti-vaccine sentiment to undermine herd immunity if an unsafe vaccine is rushed to market. The supply chain for vaccine materials also faces risks of breaking down due to bottlenecks and hoarding. In the meantime, policymakers are criticized for banking on a future vaccine while people are dying and the economy is hobbled. The focus should be on implementing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures to reduce cases and deaths in the present.
