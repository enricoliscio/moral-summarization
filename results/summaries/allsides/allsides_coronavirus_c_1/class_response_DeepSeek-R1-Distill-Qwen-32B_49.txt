Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article discusses the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the efforts like Operation Warp Speed, and expert opinions. It mentions the potential for herd immunity through a vaccine versus the dangerous alternative of waiting. There's skepticism about the timeline and concerns about vaccine distribution, public sentiment, and the risks of rushing development.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with the main goal: ending the pandemic with a vaccine. Mention the global efforts and the number of candidates in development. Include Fauci's cautious optimism and the target for herd immunity. Then, highlight the debate points: the record-breaking timeline, production and distribution challenges, and the risks of setbacks or an unsafe vaccine. Also, touch on the alternative approaches like testing and tracing, and the potential for vaccine skepticism.

I should use the moral words like 'establish,' 'deaths,' 'tracing,' 'therapeutic,''mitigation,' 'undermine,' 'break,' 'bottlenecks,' 'hoarding,' 'banking,' 'dying,' 'hobbled,' 'tragedy,''reduce.' I need to weave these naturally into the summary without making it forced.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well. I'll start by stating the main goal, then the efforts, followed by the challenges and debates, and conclude with the importance of alternative measures and the risks involved. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY: The race to develop a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the most effective way to establish herd immunity and end the pandemic, with over 100 potential vaccines in development globally. Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021, while experts warn that waiting for natural immunity could lead to millions of deaths. However, skepticism remains about the timeline, as developing a vaccine by the end of the year would break records. Even if successful, production and distribution challenges could create bottlenecks, and rushing development might result in an unsafe vaccine, undermining public trust. Some argue that relying too heavily on a vaccine could delay efforts to implement mitigation measures like testing, tracing, and therapeutic treatments. Others warn that vaccine skepticism could reduce herd immunity, while the tragedy of unnecessary deaths continues as the economy remains hobbled. Experts emphasize the need to prepare for long-term solutions, including reducing current case numbers, rather than banking on a miracle cure. END OF SUMMARY.
