Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that the end of the pandemic hinges on an effective vaccine. They mention that over 100 potential vaccines are in development, some in human trials. The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed aims for millions of doses by the end of the year. Dr. Fauci is cautiously optimistic for early 2021. Experts say herd immunity is needed, which a vaccine can achieve safely, unlike waiting for natural infection which could lead to millions of deaths.

Then, the article discusses the debate. Some experts are skeptical about a vaccine being ready by early 2021 because developing a vaccine that quickly would break records. Even if successful, production and distribution on a large scale are challenges. There's concern that relying too much on a quick vaccine might neglect other measures like testing and tracing. Others worry that rushing could lead to unsafe vaccines and increase anti-vaccine sentiment. Also, any vaccine might not be fully effective or long-lasting.

Different perspectives are given: vaccine skepticism could hinder herd immunity, a vaccine isn't a magic solution but the best path, supply chain issues could delay distribution, and waiting for a vaccine might be causing current deaths.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the importance of a vaccine, mention the efforts and optimism, then the skepticism and challenges. Finally, I'll touch on the differing perspectives.

Let me structure it: introduce the vaccine as the key to ending the pandemic, mention the number of candidates and Operation Warp Speed. Then, the skepticism about the timeline, production, distribution, and potential risks. Finally, the various viewpoints on vaccine effectiveness, current measures, and public sentiment.

I should ensure it's concise and covers all main points without being too detailed. I'll aim for clarity and flow, making sure each sentence transitions smoothly to the next.

SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is seen as the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 potential candidates in various stages of development, including human trials. The Trump administrationâ€™s Operation Warp Speed aims to produce millions of doses by the end of 2020, with Dr. Anthony Fauci expressing cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. Herd immunity, achieved through a vaccine, is considered the safest way to control the virus, as waiting for natural infection could lead to millions of deaths. However, experts express skepticism about the timeline, noting the record-breaking speed required and the challenges of production and distribution. Some worry that relying too heavily on a quick vaccine may divert attention from immediate measures like testing and tracing. Additionally, rushed development could result in unsafe vaccines, fueling anti-vaccine sentiment, while any vaccine might not be fully effective or long-lasting. Perspectives vary, with some emphasizing the need for realistic planning and others highlighting the importance of a vaccine despite its limitations. END OF SUMMARY.
