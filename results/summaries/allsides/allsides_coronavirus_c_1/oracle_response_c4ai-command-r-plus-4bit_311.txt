SUMMARY: Despite the promising progress on potential coronavirus vaccines, there are significant reasons to remain skeptical about a quick solution. Developing a vaccine by early next year would be a remarkable feat, but it is essential to manage expectations and prepare for potential setbacks. Rushing the process may increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, undermining public trust and potentially hindering efforts to achieve herd immunity. Furthermore, even with a vaccine, the pandemic will not instantly end. We must continue to focus on implementing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures to mitigate the virus's spread in the meantime. As we navigate this challenging period, it is crucial to balance optimism with realism, ensuring that our actions today do not come at the cost of unnecessary deaths tomorrow.
