Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, the optimism around it, and the skepticism from experts. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the importance of a vaccine for herd immunity, the progress made with Operation Warp Speed, expert opinions on the timeline, and the concerns about distribution, public skepticism, and potential risks of rushing the vaccine.

I should highlight the moral aspects, like the balance between hope and caution, the ethical considerations of rushing a vaccine, and the importance of current measures to prevent deaths.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the moral implications as presented.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the global effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with 100+ candidates in various stages of development and Operation Warp Speed aiming for millions of doses by year-end. Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. Achieving herd immunity through a vaccine is seen as the quickest and safest path, but experts caution against overoptimism. Developing a vaccine in months would break records, and even if successful, production and distribution pose significant challenges. Some argue that relying too much on a near-term vaccine may delay implementing current mitigation measures, risking more deaths. Additionally, rushing vaccine development could lead to unsafe products, exacerbating anti-vaccine sentiment. While a vaccine offers hope, it wonâ€™t be a magic solution, and preparation for long-term measures remains crucial. END OF SUMMARY.
