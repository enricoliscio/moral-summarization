Alright, so I need to summarize this article about the coronavirus vaccine efforts. Let me read through it again to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that a vaccine is the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 candidates in development, some in human trials. The US has Operation Warp Speed aiming for millions of doses by the end of the year, and Dr. Fauci is cautiously optimistic for early 2021. Herd immunity is needed, which a vaccine can provide safely, unlike waiting for natural infection which could cause millions of deaths.

Then, there's debate about whether a vaccine will be ready soon. Experts are skeptical because developing a vaccine in less than a year would break records, and even if successful, production and distribution are huge challenges. Some worry that relying too much on a quick vaccine might divert resources from current mitigation efforts like testing and tracing. There's also the risk of an unsafe vaccine and potential public skepticism, which could hinder herd immunity. Additionally, any vaccine might not be fully effective or long-lasting.

Different perspectives are presented: vaccine skepticism could make herd immunity hard, the vaccine isn't a magic solution but still the best hope, supply chain issues could delay distribution, and waiting for a vaccine is causing current deaths.

So, the summary needs to cover these points concisely: the importance of a vaccine, current efforts, skepticism about timelines, production/distribution challenges, risks of rushing, and different viewpoints on the situation.

I should structure it to first state the main goal (vaccine for herd immunity), mention the efforts and optimism, then the skepticism and challenges, followed by the various perspectives. Keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but cover all key aspects.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, with over 100 candidates in various stages of development, including human trials. The U.S. launched "Operation Warp Speed" to produce millions of doses by year-end, with Dr. Anthony Fauci expressing cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. Herd immunity, achievable through a vaccine, is seen as the quickest and safest way to end the pandemic. However, experts express skepticism about the timeline, citing the unprecedented speed required to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine. Concerns include potential setbacks, public skepticism, and the risk of an unsafe vaccine. Some argue that focusing too much on a vaccine may delay efforts to implement current mitigation measures like testing and tracing. Perspectives vary, with some emphasizing the vaccine's potential while others stress the need for immediate action to reduce deaths and economic harm. END OF SUMMARY.
