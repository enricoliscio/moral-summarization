SUMMARY: There is a general consensus that a vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and bring the coronavirus pandemic under control. However, experts warn that there are significant reasons to be skeptical of the accelerated timeline for developing a vaccine, which could lead to setbacks and increased anti-vaccine sentiment. It is important to manage expectations and prepare for the possibility that a vaccine may not be available for years, by investing in effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the potential challenges in producing and distributing the vaccine globally, as well as the possibility of a less effective or short-term immunity vaccine. While a vaccine is the best path out of the pandemic, it is important to balance optimism with realistic planning and continue implementing virus mitigation measures in the meantime.
