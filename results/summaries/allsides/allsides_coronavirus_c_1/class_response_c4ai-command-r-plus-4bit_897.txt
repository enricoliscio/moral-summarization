SUMMARY: The race to develop a coronavirus vaccine is well underway, with over 100 potential candidates in various stages of development. While a vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and bring an end to the pandemic, there are significant challenges and reasons to be skeptical of an imminent solution. Developing and distributing a vaccine at the necessary scale will be a massive undertaking, and experts warn that investing too much hope in a best-case scenario could hinder efforts to implement effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures that are needed right now. There are also concerns about rushing development and the potential for setbacks that could increase anti-vaccine sentiment, undermining herd immunity efforts. The supply chain for vaccine materials could also break down, leading to hoarding and distribution bottlenecks. While waiting on a miracle cure, policymakers are witnessing unnecessary deaths that could be reduced with existing strategies. The development of a vaccine is a promising step towards ending the pandemic, but it is important to manage expectations and continue mitigation efforts in the meantime.
