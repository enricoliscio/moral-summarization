Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user mentioned to label this step as "STEP 1:" and list each word with a * at the beginning. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "truth," "effort," "cautiously optimistic," "skeptical," "best-case scenario," "anti-vaccine," "miracle cure," and "tragedy" come to mind because they imply judgment or evaluation.

Next, I have to write a summary of the article. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the race for a vaccine, the optimism and skepticism, the challenges in distribution, the risks of rushing, and the importance of current measures. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the vaccine efforts, then the skepticism, the potential risks, and the need for current measures.

I also need to ensure that the summary doesn't just list facts but reflects the moral perspective presented in the original article. This means highlighting concerns about over-optimism leading to complacency, the risks of unsafe vaccines, and the ethical dilemma of relying too much on a future solution while people are suffering now.

I should avoid jargon and keep the language clear, but still include the morally charged words to maintain the original framing. Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words and that each point is succinctly covered.

Finally, I'll format the response with the STEP 1 section listing the words and then the SUMMARY section. I need to end the summary with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed. Let me review everything to ensure it meets the user's requirements and flows naturally.

**STEP 1:**  
* Truth  
* Effort  
* Optimistic  
* Skeptical  
* Miracle  
* Tragedy  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, highlighting the moral implications of relying on a potential "miracle" solution. While there is cautious optimism about a vaccine being available by early 2021, experts warn against over-optimism, as developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine on such a scale is unprecedented. Skeptics argue that focusing too much on a "best-case scenario" could divert attention from immediate measures like testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines, which are critical to reducing deaths and slowing the spread now. There are also concerns about the risks of rushing vaccine development, including the possibility of an unsafe vaccine and increased anti-vaccine sentiment. Additionally, the article raises the moral issue that waiting for a vaccine may delay necessary actions to save lives and control the pandemic. The debate underscores the need for a balanced approach, recognizing that while a vaccine is the most hopeful path, it is not a "miracle cure" and will not immediately end the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
