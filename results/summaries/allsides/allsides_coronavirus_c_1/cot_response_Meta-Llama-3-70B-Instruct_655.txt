SUMMARY:
The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While experts are "cautiously optimistic" about having a vaccine ready by early 2021, others are "skeptical" about the idea that a game-changing vaccine is just around the corner. The fastest vaccine ever developed took four years, and even if a vaccine is developed quickly, producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses will be a significant challenge. Some argue that investing too much in a "best-case scenario" may distract from developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. The "tragedy" is that waiting for a future vaccine may lead to unnecessary deaths, and policymakers should focus on reducing cases and deaths now. A vaccine is still the "best path" out of the pandemic, but it's essential to be "hopeful" yet realistic about the challenges ahead.
