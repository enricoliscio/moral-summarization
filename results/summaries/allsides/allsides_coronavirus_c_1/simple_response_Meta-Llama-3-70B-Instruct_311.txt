SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is widely considered the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. However, experts warn that rushing development may lead to unsafe vaccines, and even if a vaccine is developed quickly, producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses will be a significant challenge. Moreover, relying too heavily on a vaccine may distract from implementing necessary mitigation measures, and skepticism about vaccine effectiveness could undermine herd immunity. A more cautious approach would prioritize developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. The focus should be on reducing cases and deaths now, rather than waiting for a miracle cure in the future.
