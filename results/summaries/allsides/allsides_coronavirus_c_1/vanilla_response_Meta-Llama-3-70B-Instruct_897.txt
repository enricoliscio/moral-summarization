SUMMARY:

The development of a COVID-19 vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that developing a vaccine by the end of the year would be unprecedented and would require producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses. Some argue that investing too much in a quick vaccine development may distract from developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. Others worry that rushing development could lead to an unsafe vaccine, increase anti-vaccine sentiment, and undermine herd immunity. Despite the challenges, a vaccine remains the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and end the pandemic.
