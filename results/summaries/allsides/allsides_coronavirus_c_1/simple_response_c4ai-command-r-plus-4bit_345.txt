SUMMARY: Developing a vaccine for COVID-19 is crucial to ending the pandemic and establishing herd immunity. While there is promising progress, experts caution against over-optimism and highlight potential challenges, including production and distribution bottlenecks and the risk of increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. Some argue that focusing solely on a vaccine may hinder the implementation of necessary mitigation measures and therapeutic medicines. It is important to manage expectations and be prepared for potential setbacks or limitations with a new vaccine. As such, investing in effective testing, tracing, and treatment systems is vital to complement vaccine development efforts. Reaching herd immunity will also depend on public willingness to vaccinate, with vaccine skepticism potentially impacting our ability to control the virus. While a vaccine won't be a magic solution, it remains the best path toward ending the pandemic and restoring normalcy.
