SUMMARY:

The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that rushing development may lead to an unsafe vaccine, and that the focus on a vaccine may be diverting attention from necessary mitigation measures. Others argue that it's unrealistic to expect a vaccine to be widely available soon and that we should prepare for a longer timeline by developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The idea of a vaccine being just around the corner may be holding back efforts to put necessary measures in place, and any setbacks could increase anti-vaccine sentiment, making it harder to reach herd immunity.
