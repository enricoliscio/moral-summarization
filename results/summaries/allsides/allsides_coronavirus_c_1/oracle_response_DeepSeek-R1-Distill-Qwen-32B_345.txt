Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally framed words: said, say, mitigation, rushing, break. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the progress made, and the skepticism around its timely development. The moral aspects involve the potential risks of rushing, the importance of current mitigation efforts, and the consequences of not achieving herd immunity.

I should start by highlighting the optimism about the vaccine, mentioning Operation Warp Speed and Dr. Fauci's cautious optimism. Then, I need to address the skepticism, using words like'say' and'skeptical.' I'll include the points about the unprecedented speed and the challenges in production and distribution.

Next, I'll incorporate the moral elements. The idea that rushing could lead to an unsafe vaccine ties into 'rushing.' Also, the concern that relying on a future vaccine is causing current deaths relates to'mitigation' efforts. I should mention that neglecting current measures might increase anti-vaccine sentiment, which could 'break' herd immunity.

I'll structure the summary to first present the optimistic progress, then the skeptical views, and finally the moral implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the specified moral words are included.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The race for a COVID-19 vaccine is progressing rapidly, with over 100 candidates in development and some entering human trials. The Trump administrationâ€™s "Operation Warp Speed" aims to deliver millions of doses by year-end, while Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses cautious optimism for early 2021. Experts emphasize that a vaccine is the quickest and safest path to herd immunity, avoiding the millions of deaths that could result from waiting for natural infection rates to reach 70% of the population. However, skepticism remains about the feasibility of developing a vaccine by the end of the year or even next summer, given the record-breaking speed required. Production and distribution challenges, as well as the risk of an unsafe vaccine due to rushing, are significant concerns. Some argue that over-reliance on a near-term vaccine may undermine current mitigation efforts and exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment, potentially breaking the path to herd immunity. Others warn that delays or inefficiencies in the supply chain could slow vaccine distribution, echoing the bottlenecks seen with medical supplies. While a vaccine offers hope, its development and deployment must balance speed with safety to avoid unintended consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
