Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that I should use the morally framed words like "said," "say," "mitigation," "rushing," and "break." The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the efforts like Operation Warp Speed, expert opinions on the timeline, and the potential issues like skepticism, distribution challenges, and the impact on public sentiment.

I need to make sure I include the moral elements. Words like "said" and "say" are used in the original text to attribute statements, which is important for the framing. "Mitigation" is part of the debate about current measures versus waiting for a vaccine. "Rushing" refers to the concern about developing the vaccine too quickly, which could lead to safety issues. "Break" relates to the supply chain potentially breaking down.

I should structure the summary to highlight the cautious optimism, the challenges in vaccine development and distribution, the risks of rushing, and the importance of current mitigation efforts. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but cover all key points.

I'll start by mentioning the global efforts and the optimism, then the skepticism and challenges. I'll include the potential risks and the need for mitigation. Finally, I'll touch on the supply chain issues and the importance of not relying solely on a vaccine.

Let me draft this, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's capturing the essence without being too verbose. Once done, I'll review to ensure it meets all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: The global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine is proceeding at unprecedented speed, with over 100 candidates in various stages of development. Dr. Anthony Fauci has expressed cautious optimism about a vaccine being available by early 2021, while experts warn that achieving herd immunity through a vaccine is the safest path, as waiting for natural infection could lead to millions of deaths. However, skepticism remains about the feasibility of delivering a vaccine by the end of the year or even next summer, given the record-breaking timeline and the challenges of production and distribution. Some argue that "rushing" development could compromise safety, potentially leading to an unsafe vaccine and exacerbating anti-vaccine sentiment. Additionally, there are concerns that the promise of a vaccine may "break" efforts to implement current "mitigation" measures, such as testing and tracing, which are critical to controlling the virus now. The supply chain for vaccine materials could also face bottlenecks, similar to those seen with medical supplies. While a vaccine offers hope, its success depends on public willingness to get vaccinated and the ability to address logistical and ethical challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
