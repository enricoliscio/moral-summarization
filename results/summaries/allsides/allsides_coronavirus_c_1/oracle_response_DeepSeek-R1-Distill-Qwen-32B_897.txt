Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They specified that I should keep the words "said," "say," "mitigation," "rushing," and "break." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the progress made, and the skepticism surrounding it. The author discusses the possibility of a vaccine by early 2021 but also points out the challenges like production, distribution, and public skepticism.

I need to structure the summary to include the key elements: the number of vaccines in development, Operation Warp Speed, expert optimism, the need for herd immunity, the risks of rushing, and the potential issues with public acceptance.

I should start by mentioning the common belief in a vaccine ending the pandemic, then talk about the efforts and progress. Then, include the skepticism and the risks, making sure to use "rushing" and "break." Also, highlight the concerns about public willingness to get vaccinated and the potential for supply chain issues.

I'll make sure to use "said" and "say" where appropriate, like when mentioning experts' opinions. Also, include "mitigation" when talking about current measures being neglected.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but cover all the main points. I'll start with the overview, then the progress, the skepticism, the risks, and end with the conclusion that a vaccine is the best path but challenges remain.

Let me draft this, ensuring all the morally framed words are included and the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, emphasizing the moral implications of relying on a potential solution while neglecting current mitigation measures. Over 100 vaccine candidates are in development, with some in human trials, and the Trump administrationâ€™s "Operation Warp Speed" aims for millions of doses by year-end. Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021, but experts warn that developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine in record time is risky. Rushing development could lead to unsafe vaccines or increased anti-vaccine sentiment, potentially breaking public trust. Skeptics argue that focusing on a vaccine may delay efforts to implement effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures, causing unnecessary deaths and economic harm. The article highlights the moral dilemma of balancing hope for a vaccine with the need for immediate action to curb the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
