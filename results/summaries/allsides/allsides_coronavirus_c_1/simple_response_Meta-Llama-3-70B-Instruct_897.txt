SUMMARY:

The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While experts are "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021, others are skeptical about the rapid development and distribution of a vaccine. They argue that it's unrealistic to expect a vaccine to be ready in just a few months, and that investing too much in a best-case scenario may divert attention from more effective measures to mitigate the virus. Rushing development may also increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine, which could undermine public trust and hinder herd immunity. Instead, experts suggest preparing for a longer timeline by developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The moral imperative is clear: waiting for a vaccine may lead to millions of deaths, while investing in mitigation measures can reduce cases and deaths now.
