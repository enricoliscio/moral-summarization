SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is seen as the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and potentially undermining herd immunity. Others argue that investing too much in a best-case scenario may distract from developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The idea of a vaccine being imminent may also be holding back efforts to put mitigation measures in place. Moreover, the supply chain for vaccine materials could break down, slowing down vaccine availability. Some experts urge policymakers to focus on reducing cases and deaths now, rather than waiting for a future vaccine. END OF SUMMARY.
