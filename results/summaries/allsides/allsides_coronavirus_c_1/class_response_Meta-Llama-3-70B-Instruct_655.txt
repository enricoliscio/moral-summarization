SUMMARY: The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. However, experts warn that even if a vaccine is developed quickly, it may not be the magic solution to ending the pandemic. Establishing "herd immunity" through vaccination is the safest way to stop the virus, but it requires 70% of the population to develop immunity. Waiting for enough people to be infected could lead to millions of deaths. Despite promising progress, there are concerns about investing too much in a best-case scenario, and experts argue that it's essential to prepare for a longer timeline by developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. Rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and undermining herd immunity. The focus should be on reducing the number of cases and deaths right now, rather than banking on a future vaccine. The tragedy is that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths, but it's not being utilized. END OF SUMMARY.
