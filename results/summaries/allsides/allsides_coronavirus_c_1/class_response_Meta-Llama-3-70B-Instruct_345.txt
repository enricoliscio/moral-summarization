SUMMARY: The development of an effective vaccine is widely considered the only way to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. However, experts caution that developing a vaccine at record speed may lead to unintended consequences, such as investing too much in a best-case scenario and potentially undermining herd immunity. Moreover, rushing development may increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine, which could further erode trust and lead to more deaths. Instead, experts argue that a better plan would be to prepare for a longer timeline, establishing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. This would help mitigate the spread of the virus and reduce the number of cases and deaths. The tragedy is that policymakers are banking on a future vaccine, while people are dying now and the economy is hobbled. END OF SUMMARY.
