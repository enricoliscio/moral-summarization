SUMMARY: Despite promising progress on several vaccine candidates, experts warn against being overly optimistic about a quick end to the coronavirus pandemic. Developing a safe and effective vaccine in such a short time frame would be an unprecedented achievement, and distributing hundreds of millions of doses to the people who need them will be challenging. There are also concerns that rushing the process may increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, undermining efforts to establish herd immunity and reduce deaths. In the meantime, investing in testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures, as well as following mitigation guidelines, are crucial to reducing the impact of the virus. The supply chain for vaccine materials is another potential bottleneck that could slow down distribution, especially if hoarding or production bottlenecks occur. Banking on a future vaccine that may not arrive until 2021 is also causing unnecessary deaths and economic hardship in the present. Experts emphasize that a vaccine will not be a magic solution, but it remains the best path out of the pandemic.
