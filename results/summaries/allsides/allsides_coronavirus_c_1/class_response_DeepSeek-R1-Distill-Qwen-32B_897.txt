Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, mentioning that many potential vaccines are in the works, with some in human trials. Operation Warp Speed aims to have millions of doses by the end of the year, and Dr. Fauci is cautiously optimistic about early 2021. Herd immunity is the goal, but the alternative of waiting for natural infection is dangerous with high death tolls.

There's debate about whether a vaccine by the end of the year is feasible, considering the usual vaccine development timeline is years. Even if a vaccine is developed quickly, production and distribution are huge challenges. Experts worry about over-relying on a best-case scenario, which might divert attention from current mitigation measures. Rushing could lead to unsafe vaccines, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. Also, the vaccine might not be fully effective or long-lasting.

Perspectives include vaccine skepticism hindering herd immunity, the vaccine not being a magic solution but still the best path, potential supply chain issues, and the tragedy of waiting for a vaccine while people are dying now.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping the morally framed words. I should mention the effort to establish herd immunity, the potential for millions of deaths, the importance of tracing and testing, the risks of rushing development, and the tragedy of current deaths while waiting.

I'll structure it by first stating the goal of the vaccine effort, then the challenges and debates, and finally the perspectives on the situation. I'll make sure to include words like establish, deaths, tracing, mitigation, undermine, break, bottlenecks, hoarding, banking, dying, tragedy, reduce.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating the moral language.

SUMMARY: The race to develop a coronavirus vaccine aims to establish herd immunity, preventing millions of deaths and reducing the pandemic's impact. While over 100 potential vaccines are in development, with some in human trials, experts caution against overoptimism. Operation Warp Speed seeks to deliver millions of doses by year-end, but developing a vaccine in months would break records. Production and distribution challenges, including bottlenecks and hoarding, could undermine efforts. Some argue that banking on a quick vaccine may divert focus from current mitigation measures, like tracing and therapeutic treatments, causing unnecessary deaths. Rushing development risks unsafe vaccines, potentially increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. The tragedy of delayed action could prolong the pandemic, with people dying and the economy hobbled. A vaccine is the best path forward, but it wonâ€™t be a magic solution; preparation for long-term challenges remains crucial. END OF SUMMARY.
