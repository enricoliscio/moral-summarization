SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is considered the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. Over 100 potential vaccines are in development, with some advancing to human trials. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that developing a vaccine by the end of the year would be unprecedented and that producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses would be a significant challenge. Some argue that investing too much in a vaccine may distract from developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures. Additionally, rushing development may increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine, and anti-vaccine sentiment could undermine herd immunity.
