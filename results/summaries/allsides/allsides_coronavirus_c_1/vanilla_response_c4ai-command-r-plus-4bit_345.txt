SUMMARY: There is currently a global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, with over 100 potential vaccines in development and the Trump administration aiming to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. While experts say a vaccine is the quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity and bring an end to the pandemic, there are also significant reasons to be skeptical of the accelerated timeline. Developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine at this scale and speed is unprecedented and faces many logistical challenges. Some experts worry that focusing too heavily on a vaccine may divert attention and resources away from implementing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic measures that are needed in the meantime. There are also concerns about the potential impact of rushing vaccine development, including the risk of unsafe vaccines reaching the market and increasing anti-vaccine sentiment. While a vaccine is the best path out of the pandemic, it is important to manage expectations and continue focusing on mitigation measures in the near term.
