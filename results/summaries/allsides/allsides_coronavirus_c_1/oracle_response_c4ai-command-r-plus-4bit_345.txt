SUMMARY: It is widely believed that the development of an effective vaccine is the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. While there has been promising progress on several vaccine candidates, experts warn that there are significant reasons to remain skeptical of the idea that a vaccine is just a few months away. The quickest and safest way to establish herd immunity is through a vaccine, but rushing its development may increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, which could backfire and increase anti-vaccine sentiment. There are also concerns that waiting for a vaccine may be causing unnecessary deaths and that the supply chain for vaccine materials could break down. Developing a vaccine by early next year would shatter records, and even then, drug companies would still need to produce and distribute hundreds of millions of doses. Experts argue that a better plan may be to prepare for the possibility that a vaccine could take years to develop by improving testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, he is "cautiously optimistic" about a vaccine by early 2021.
