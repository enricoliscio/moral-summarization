SUMMARY:

The development of a COVID-19 vaccine is crucial to ending the pandemic, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. Experts believe that a vaccine is the quickest and safest way to achieve "herd immunity," which requires around 70% of the population to develop immunity. However, there are concerns about the feasibility of developing a vaccine by the end of the year, given the record for the fastest vaccine development stands at four years. Additionally, there are worries about investing too much in a best-case scenario, and the potential risks of rushing development, including the possibility of an unsafe vaccine being released. Some experts argue that a better plan would be to prepare for a longer timeline, developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. The moral imperative is clear: prioritizing public health and safety over optimism and expediency.
