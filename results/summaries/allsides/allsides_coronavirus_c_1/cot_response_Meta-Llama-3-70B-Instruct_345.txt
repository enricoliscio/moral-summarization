SUMMARY:
The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021, experts warn that it's unrealistic to expect a game-changing vaccine in just a few months. Rushing development may lead to an unsafe vaccine, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment and undermining herd immunity. Moreover, waiting for a miracle cure is causing "unnecessary deaths" right now. Instead, policymakers should focus on implementing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. A vaccine is still the "best" path out of the pandemic, but it's not a "magic solution." It's essential to be "hopeful" yet realistic about the challenges ahead. END OF SUMMARY.
