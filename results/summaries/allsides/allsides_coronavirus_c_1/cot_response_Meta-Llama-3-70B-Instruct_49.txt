SUMMARY:
The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. While experts are "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021, others are "skeptical" about the idea that a game-changing vaccine is just a few months away. Developing a vaccine by the end of the year would be a record-breaking feat, but it's still uncertain. Even if a vaccine is developed, producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses will be a significant challenge. Some argue that investing too much in a best-case scenario may divert attention from developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. Rushing development may also increase the risk of an "unsafe" vaccine and undermine "herd immunity". It's essential to be "hopeful" but also prepare for the possibility that a vaccine may not be entirely "effective" or provide immunity only for a short period. END OF SUMMARY.
