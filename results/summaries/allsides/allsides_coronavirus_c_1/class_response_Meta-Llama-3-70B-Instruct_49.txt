SUMMARY: The development of an effective vaccine is crucial to establish herd immunity and mitigate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. However, experts warn that rushing the development process may undermine efforts to implement necessary mitigation measures, leading to unnecessary deaths. Moreover, there is a risk of investing too much in a best-case scenario, which may not materialize. Instead, a better plan would be to prepare for a longer timeline, developing effective systems of testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. The supply chain for vaccine materials must also be secured to prevent bottlenecks and hoarding. Meanwhile, policymakers should not bank on a future vaccine, but rather focus on reducing the number of cases and deaths right now. The tragedy is that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths, but it's being overlooked. END OF SUMMARY.
