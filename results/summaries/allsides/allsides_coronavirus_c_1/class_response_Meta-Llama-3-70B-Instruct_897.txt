SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is widely regarded as the only way to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. However, experts warn that establishing herd immunity through vaccination is not a guarantee, and that waiting for enough people to be infected could lead to millions of deaths. Instead, they advocate for a more cautious approach, investing in testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. Rushing development may backfire, increasing the risk of an unsafe vaccine and undermining herd immunity. Moreover, the supply chain for vaccine materials could break down, causing bottlenecks and hoarding. Meanwhile, policymakers are banking on a future vaccine, while people are dying now, and the economy is hobbled. It's a tragedy that there is a playbook that can reduce the number of cases and deaths right now, but it's being ignored.
