SUMMARY:

The development of an effective vaccine is seen as the only way to end the coronavirus pandemic. With over 100 potential vaccines in development, the Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that developing a vaccine by the end of the year would be unprecedented and would require producing and distributing hundreds of millions of doses. Some argue that it's better to prepare for a longer timeline and focus on developing effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines. There are also concerns that rushing development could lead to an unsafe vaccine, increase anti-vaccine sentiment, and undermine herd immunity. Despite the challenges, a vaccine is still seen as the best path out of the pandemic.
