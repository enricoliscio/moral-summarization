Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the global effort to develop a vaccine, mentions Operation Warp Speed, and the cautious optimism from experts. It also discusses the potential for herd immunity and the risks of waiting too long. The article then goes into the debate about whether a vaccine by early 2021 is feasible, considering the usual time it takes to develop vaccines and the challenges in production and distribution. There are concerns about vaccine skepticism, the possibility of an unsafe vaccine, and the effectiveness of any vaccine developed. Different perspectives are presented, such as the importance of a vaccine despite its limitations, the risks of supply chain issues, and the argument that relying on a future vaccine is causing current problems.

Now, I need to structure the summary. I should start by stating the main goal, which is the development of a vaccine to end the pandemic. Then, mention the global efforts and the optimism from experts. Next, outline the challenges and debates: the unprecedented speed, potential production and distribution issues, vaccine skepticism, and the risks of rushing. I should also include the different viewpoints presented, like the necessity of a vaccine despite its limitations, the risks of supply chain problems, and the critique of relying too much on a future vaccine while neglecting current measures.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects. The moral framing includes the importance of a vaccine for public health, the ethical concerns about rushing development, and the potential consequences of public skepticism. I should highlight the balance between hope and caution, and the need for preparedness in case the vaccine isn't the immediate solution.

Let me piece this together, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, I need to end the summary with the specified tokens, so I'll make sure to include "SUMMARY:" at the start and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and accurately reflects the moral perspectives from the original article.

SUMMARY: The global effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is seen as the key to ending the pandemic, with over 100 candidates in various stages of development. The U.S. "Operation Warp Speed" aims for millions of doses by year-end, with Dr. Anthony Fauci expressing cautious optimism for a vaccine by early 2021. However, experts caution against overoptimism, highlighting the unprecedented speed required to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine. Concerns include potential setbacks, vaccine skepticism, and the risk of unsafe vaccines. Some argue that focusing on a future vaccine may divert attention from current mitigation measures, which could save lives now. While a vaccine offers hope, it wonâ€™t be a magic solution, and preparedness for long-term measures remains crucial. END OF SUMMARY.
