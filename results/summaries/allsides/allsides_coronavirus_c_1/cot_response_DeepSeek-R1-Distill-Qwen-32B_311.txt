Okay, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the challenges involved, and different expert opinions on the matter.

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. The user has specified two steps: Step 1 is to identify all single words that are morally framed, each on a new line starting with an asterisk. Step 2 is to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible, with the summary constrained to 200 words.

Looking at the news article, I notice several terms that carry moral implications. Words like "truth," "end," "effort," "safest," "deaths," "skeptical," "feet," "anti-vaccine," "effective," and "tragedy" stand out. These words convey value judgments or ethical considerations, which are crucial for preserving the moral framing.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary that incorporates these terms. The summary should highlight the optimism around the vaccine's development, the skepticism about its timely arrival, the risks of rushing the process, the challenges in distribution, and the potential consequences of vaccine hesitancy.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the importance of a vaccine, then moving into the skepticism and challenges, and finally touching on the ethical concerns and the need for alternative measures. Each morally framed word should fit naturally into the narrative without forcing them in.

I also need to keep an eye on the word count, making sure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll have to be concise but comprehensive, covering all key points without unnecessary details.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all identified morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral perspective. This approach should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**STEP 1:**  
* truth  
* end  
* effort  
* safest  
* deaths  
* skeptical  
* feet  
* anti-vaccine  
* effective  
* tragedy  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, highlighting the moral and practical challenges involved. While experts express cautious optimism about a vaccine being available by early 2021, there are significant doubts about whether a safe and effective vaccine can be developed and distributed quickly enough to stop the pandemic. The moral imperative to save lives clashes with the risks of rushing vaccine development, which could lead to unsafe vaccines or increased anti-vaccine sentiment. The article also raises concerns that focusing too much on a future vaccine may distract from immediate measures needed to reduce deaths and control the spread of the virus. The moral stakes are high, as any setbacks could undermine herd immunity and prolong the pandemic. Ultimately, the article emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, preparing for both the best-case scenario and the possibility of long-term challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
