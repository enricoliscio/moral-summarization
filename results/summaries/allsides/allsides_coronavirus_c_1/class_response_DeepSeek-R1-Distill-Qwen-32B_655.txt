Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible and be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the efforts like Operation Warp Speed, the cautious optimism from experts, and the potential challenges such as production, distribution, public skepticism, and the risks of rushing the vaccine.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words used: establish, deaths, tracing, therapeutic, mitigation, undermine, break, bottlenecks, hoarding, banking, dying, hobbled, tragedy, reduce. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the optimism about the vaccine but also the skepticism and challenges. I'll mention the goal of herd immunity, the potential for millions of deaths without a vaccine, and the risks of rushing development. Also, I'll touch on the importance of current mitigation measures and the tragedy of delayed action.

I'll start by stating the main goal, then mention the progress and skepticism, followed by the challenges in production and distribution. I'll include the risks of public skepticism and the potential consequences. Finally, I'll note the argument for investing in current measures instead of waiting for a vaccine.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make each sentence cover a main point without going into too much detail. I'll ensure the morally framed words are naturally integrated into the summary.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all the necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count and adjust if needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, emphasizing its potential to establish herd immunity and prevent millions of deaths. While progress is promising, experts caution against overoptimism, as developing, producing, and distributing a vaccine by early 2021 would break records and face significant bottlenecks. Concerns include the risk of an unsafe vaccine undermining public trust, as well as the possibility that any vaccine may not be entirely effective or long-lasting. Some argue that banking on a quick vaccine rollout may hinder current mitigation efforts, such as tracing and therapeutic measures, which are critical to reducing deaths and slowing the virusâ€™s spread. Others warn that delays or setbacks could exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment, further complicating efforts to achieve herd immunity. Meanwhile, critics argue that waiting for a miracle cure is causing unnecessary suffering and economic hobbled, advocating instead for a tragedy-reduction strategy that prioritizes testing, tracing, and treatments to save lives now.
