Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the task. They want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to write a summary that preserves as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and follow a specific structure with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

Looking at the article, it's about the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. The key points are the efforts to create a vaccine quickly, the potential for herd immunity, the risks of rushing development, and the importance of other measures like testing and tracing. 

For the first step, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "truth," "effort," "development," "skeptical," "cautiously optimistic," "quickly," "safest," "spread," "deaths," "shatter," "unprecedented," "challenges," "investing," "perfectly," "prepare," "mitigation," "backfire," "unsafe," "anti-vaccine," "effective," "difficult," "miracle," "hoped," "bottlenecks," "tragedy," "playbook," "sick," "dying," "hobbled," "stability." These words reflect the moral framing around the necessity, risks, and ethical considerations of vaccine development.

Now, for the summary, I need to encapsulate the article's main points while including these morally charged words. I'll start by stating the common belief in a vaccine ending the pandemic, mention the global efforts and the timeline, then address the skepticism and challenges. I'll include the potential risks of rushing the vaccine and the need for other measures. Finally, I'll note the importance of public cooperation and the ethical concerns about distribution and effectiveness.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms without making it too lengthy. 

I think I've covered all the key points and incorporated the morally framed words effectively. The summary should reflect the balance between hope for a vaccine and the cautionary considerations surrounding its development and distribution.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the moral and practical implications of developing a coronavirus vaccine. While there is cautious optimism about a vaccine being available by early 2021, experts warn against overinvesting in this best-case scenario, as the development and distribution process could face significant challenges. The idea of a vaccine being just months away may undermine current efforts to implement virus mitigation measures, and rushing its development could backfire by producing an unsafe vaccine, exacerbating anti-vaccine sentiment. Additionally, any new vaccine may not be entirely effective or long-lasting. The article emphasizes the importance of preparing for the possibility that a vaccine may take years to become widely available, while also highlighting the tragedy of relying too heavily on a future miracle cure, which could delay necessary actions to reduce current deaths and economic instability. END OF SUMMARY.
