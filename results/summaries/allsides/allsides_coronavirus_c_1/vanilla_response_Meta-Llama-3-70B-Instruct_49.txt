SUMMARY:

The development of a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with over 100 potential vaccines in various stages of development. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci is "cautiously optimistic" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. However, experts warn that developing a vaccine by the end of the year would be unprecedented and that production and distribution could take years. Additionally, there are concerns about investing too much in a best-case scenario and neglecting other measures to mitigate the virus. Rushing development could also lead to an unsafe vaccine, which could increase anti-vaccine sentiment and undermine herd immunity. Experts argue that a more effective approach would be to develop effective testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines to last until a vaccine is widely available.
