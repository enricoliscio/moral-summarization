SUMMARY: In March, Democratic leaders on the East Coast failed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with devastating consequences. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, forced nursing homes to accept infected residents back, leading to thousands of deaths. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a lower death rate. Despite these initial errors, Cuomo eventually rose to the occasion, imposing a lockdown that helped control the virus. However, other states, like Arizona, Florida, and Texas, have failed to take similar actions, even preventing cities from mandating mask-wearing. The recent mass protests and the liberal support for them have further divided the country, with conservatives becoming more resistant to social distancing rules. Public health workers are now facing threats and harassment from those who view the pandemic warnings as a tool of social control. As the death toll surpasses 120,000, it is clear that the war against the virus is ongoing, and the lack of competent leadership in some states means America will continue to be pummeled.

END OF SUMMARY.
