SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, during the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's errors, including forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring them from testing, contributed to the catastrophic death toll of over 6,000 people in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also criticizes the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who failed to impose simple measures like mask-wearing, and even prevented cities from doing so. The author notes that public health workers have faced death threats, harassment, and armed protesters, and that the political will to contain the virus is lacking in "red America." The article concludes that the US will continue to be "pummeled" by the pandemic due to incompetent leadership, citing Trump's sycophant Lindsey Graham's misguided statement that the death toll of 120,000 was acceptable.

END OF SUMMARY.
