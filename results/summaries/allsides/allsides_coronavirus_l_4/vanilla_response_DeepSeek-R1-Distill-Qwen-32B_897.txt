Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how during the COVID-19 outbreak in March, Democratic leaders on the East Coast had some failures. Specifically, New York's Governor Cuomo made some bad decisions, like forcing nursing homes to take back COVID patients from hospitals without testing them. This led to a lot of deaths in nursing homesâ€”over 6,000 people. Florida, which didn't do that, had fewer deaths in their nursing homes.

Then, the article contrasts this with states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. These states aren't enforcing mask mandates, and their governors even stopped cities from making their own rules. There's some debate about whether the protests against police violence caused more COVID cases, but many conservatives are against strict distancing rules, seeing them as hypocritical. Public health workers are getting threatened and harassed because of this.

The article ends by mentioning that while other countries with good leadership are getting back to normal, the U.S. is still struggling. Trump's supporters, like Lindsey Graham, thought if deaths stayed below 120,000, it was manageable, but we've surpassed that, and the pandemic is still ongoing.

So, the main points are: Cuomo's mistakes leading to nursing home deaths, other states not enforcing masks, political issues with pandemic measures, and the U.S. not handling it well compared to others.

I need to make a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include the key failures, the impact on nursing homes, the contrast with other states, the political divide, and the current situation.

SUMMARY: The article discusses failures in COVID-19 response by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who mandated nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients without testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in nursing homes. In contrast, Florida, which prohibited such transfers, had fewer deaths. Meanwhile, states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have not mandated masks, with governors blocking local mask requirements. The article highlights political polarization, with conservatives viewing pandemic restrictions as hypocritical, leading to harassment of public health workers. Despite other countries' progress, the U.S. continues to struggle, with Trump supporters like Lindsey Graham downplaying the death toll. The pandemic persists, and the U.S. has surpassed 120,000 deaths. END OF SUMMARY.
