SUMMARY: There have been devastating failures and moral shortcomings in the response to the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among Democratic leaders on the East Coast. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo forced nursing homes to accept residents with the coronavirus and prohibited testing, leading to tragic consequences. This contrasts with states like Florida, which prohibited such transfers and experienced lower fatality rates. Cuomo's errors raise questions about his ability to lead effectively during a crisis. Meanwhile, states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to implement basic safety measures like mandating mask-wearing, with governors even preventing cities from instituting their own requirements. The politicization of the pandemic response and the mixed messaging from protests have further complicated efforts to control the virus, with public health workers facing threats and harassment. The lack of competent leadership and moral responsibility in red America is concerning, and the country will continue to suffer the consequences as other nations move forward. Lindsey Graham once stated that limiting casualties to 120,000 would be a success; we have now surpassed that grim milestone, and the war against the virus continues, with Trump having already lost it.
END OF SUMMARY.
