SUMMARY:
The coronavirus crisis has laid bare the devastating consequences of incompetent leadership in the United States. Despite the known dangers, Democratic leaders in New York made catastrophic errors early on, forcing nursing homes to accept infected residents without testing, resulting in thousands of deaths. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to mandate even basic precautions like mask-wearing, allowing paranoia and resentment toward public health warnings to fester. Across the country, public health workers are facing death threats and armed protesters at their homes. As America continues to be pummel by the virus, the death toll has now surpassed 120,000, a grim milestone that Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham once suggested would represent success in "limiting the casualties" of this war. But with incompetent leadership and a divided nation, the war against the coronavirus has already been lost. END OF SUMMARY.
