SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the handling of the coronavirus pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back infected residents and prohibited testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and saw a much lower death rate. The article also condemns the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who have not mandated mask-wearing and initially prevented cities from doing so. The author argues that conservative opposition to social distancing measures, fueled by paranoia and resentment, has hindered efforts to contain the virus. Public health workers have faced death threats and harassment, and the country's response to the pandemic has been inadequate. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the virus due to a lack of competent leadership.
