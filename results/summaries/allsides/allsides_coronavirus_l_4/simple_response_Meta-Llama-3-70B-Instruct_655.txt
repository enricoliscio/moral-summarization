SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's order to force nursing homes to take back infected residents led to the deaths of over 6,000 people, compared to Florida's 1.6% mortality rate. Meanwhile, Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to implement basic measures like mask-wearing, and have even prevented cities from doing so. The article argues that the lack of political will to contain the virus is rooted in the paranoia and resentment of the modern right, which has led to death threats and harassment against public health workers. As a result, the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic, while countries with competent leadership slowly return to normal. The article concludes that Trump has already lost the "war" against the virus, with the death toll now exceeding 120,000.
