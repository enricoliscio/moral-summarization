Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about how Democratic leaders, specifically Cuomo, made mistakes in handling the COVID-19 crisis in New York, leading to many deaths in nursing homes. It contrasts this with Florida's approach, which had fewer deaths. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, but the article questions how much credit he deserves.

Then it shifts to Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, criticizing their refusal to mandate masks and even blocking cities from doing so. There's also mention of how protests against police violence might have contributed to virus spikes, with liberals supporting the protests, leading conservatives to view social distancing as a tool of control. This has led to harassment of public health workers.

The article ends by comparing the U.S. to other countries with competent leadership and mentions Trump's comments about casualties, indicating he's lost the battle against the virus.

I need to capture these points succinctly, highlighting the moral failings and political failures on both sides but focusing on the Democratic and Republican actions as per the author's framing. Also, keep it under 200 words and structure it with a clear summary and ending tokens.

SUMMARY: The article highlights moral and political failures in the U.S. COVID-19 response, particularly under Democratic and Republican leadership. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's flawed decisions, such as forcing nursing homes to accept infected residents without testing, led to over 6,000 deaths in facilities, while Florida's cautious approach resulted in fewer fatalities. Cuomo eventually implemented a lockdown, but his earlier missteps cast doubt on his leadership. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas refused to mandate masks and even blocked cities from enforcing such measures. The article also notes how support for anti-police violence protests has fueled conservative suspicions of social distancing as a "social control" tool, leading to harassment of public health workers. The U.S. lags behind other countries with competent leadership, and Trump's dismissal of the pandemic's severity, as seen in his comments about casualties, underscores a lost battle against the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
