SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back infected residents without testing them led to a catastrophic 6% death rate among nursing home residents in New York. In contrast, Florida's ban on such transfers resulted in a much lower 1.6% death rate. The article also criticizes Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas for failing to implement basic measures like mask mandates, allowing the virus to spread unchecked. The author argues that the political will to contain the virus is lacking in "red America," where public health workers face death threats and harassment. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic due to incompetent leadership, citing Trump's lackey Lindsey Graham's callous remark that 120,000 fatalities would be an acceptable "limit" on casualties.

END OF SUMMARY.
