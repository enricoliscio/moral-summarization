Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how Democratic leaders, especially Cuomo, made failures during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York. Cuomo forced nursing homes to take back residents without testing, leading to thousands of deaths. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had fewer deaths. Cuomo eventually imposed a lockdown, which helped, but other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas aren't mandating masks. Governors there even prevented cities from requiring masks. There's also mention of mass protests possibly contributing to virus spikes, with liberals supporting them, which conservatives see as hypocritical. Public health workers are facing threats and harassment. The article ends by noting the US death toll reached 120,000, which Trump downplayed, and Trump has lost the battle against the virus.

Now, I need to highlight the moral aspects. Words like failures, forced, barred, prohibited, errors, imposed, prevented, threats, harassment, leadership, lost. I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate.

I'll start by mentioning Cuomo's failures and the consequences. Then contrast with Florida's approach. Highlight Cuomo's later actions. Move on to other states' inaction and the impact on public health workers. End with the death toll and Trump's loss.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure each moral term is included where it fits naturally.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral failures of Democratic leaders during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back infected residents while barring testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths. In contrast, Florida's prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer fatalities. Cuomo's errors contributed to New York's catastrophe, though he later imposed a lockdown that helped control the outbreak. Meanwhile, states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to mandate masks, with governors even preventing cities from implementing their own requirements. The article notes that mass protests over police violence may have contributed to virus spikes, with liberals supporting the demonstrations, fueling conservative suspicions of social control through distancing rules. Public health workers face death threats, harassment, and armed protesters, reflecting the paranoia and resentment directed at those warning about the pandemic. As other countries with competent leadership recover, the U.S. continues to struggle, with the death toll surpassing 120,000â€”a number Trump dismissed as manageable. The article concludes that Trump has already lost the battle against the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
