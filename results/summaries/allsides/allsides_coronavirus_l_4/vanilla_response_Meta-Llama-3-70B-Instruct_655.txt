SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back infected residents and bar them from testing led to devastating consequences, with over 6,000 deaths in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and saw a much lower death rate. The article also blames Republican leaders, such as the governors of Arizona and Texas, for not implementing simple measures like mask mandates, and for preventing cities from doing so. The author argues that the lack of political will to contain the virus, fueled by conservative resentment and paranoia, will continue to hinder the US response to the pandemic. As a result, the US will lag behind other countries with competent leadership in returning to normal.
