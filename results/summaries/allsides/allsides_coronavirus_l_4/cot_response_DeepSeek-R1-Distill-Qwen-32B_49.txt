Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions on how to approach this. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context and the moral elements involved.

The article discusses the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by different leaders, particularly focusing on Cuomo, Trump, and governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas. It highlights failures, consequences, and political responses. The user wants me to identify morally framed words and then create a summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to extract all single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "failures," "forced," "barred," "catastrophe," "calamity," "mandating," "hypocritical," "paranoia," "resentment," "harassment," "sycophant," "limited," "casualties," "war," and "lost" stand out as they imply judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article, ensuring I include these moral terms. I need to highlight Cuomo's actions, the comparison with Florida, the lack of measures in other states, the political divide, and the overall impact on public health. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the critical tone present in the original text.

I should structure the summary to first address Cuomo's mistakes, then contrast with other states, discuss the political response, and conclude with the ongoing pandemic's impact. This approach ensures that the moral framing is preserved, showing the failure of leadership and the consequences on public health.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check that all the identified moral words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's critical perspective on the pandemic's handling.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose decisions led to devastating consequences in nursing homes. Cuomo’s failure to test residents after hospital transfers allowed the virus to spread, killing thousands. In contrast, Florida’s prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer deaths. While Cuomo eventually imposed a lockdown, other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to implement basic measures like mandating masks. Political divisions have deepened, with conservatives viewing social distancing as hypocritical social control, and public health workers facing harassment and threats. The article highlights the lack of political will in red states to contain the virus, while countries with competent leadership are recovering. Trump’s downplaying of the pandemic, exemplified by Lindsey Graham’s dismissive comments, underscores the failure to limit casualties, with the U.S. death toll surpassing 120,000. The pandemic continues to ravage the country, and Trump has already lost the battle against it.
