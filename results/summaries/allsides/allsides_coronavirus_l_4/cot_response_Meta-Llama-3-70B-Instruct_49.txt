SUMMARY:
The article criticizes the response to the coronavirus pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York's governor Andrew Cuomo, who made "devastating failures" by forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and prohibiting testing. This led to a "catastrophe" with over 6,000 deaths in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a much lower death rate. The article also condemns the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who failed to implement simple measures like mask-wearing, allowing the virus to spread further. The author argues that the "paranoia and resentment" of the modern right have led to a lack of political will to contain the virus, resulting in a "bad" situation that will only continue to worsen.
