Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want a concise summary that includes the specific morally charged words from the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how different states handled the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly focusing on Cuomo's actions in New York and comparing it to Florida, Arizona, and Texas. The article also touches on political responses and the impact on public health workers.

The user provided a list of morally framed words: failures, forced, take, barred, prohibited, errors, rising, imposed, helped, doing, prevented, violence, directed, warning, threats, harassment, leadership, limited, lost. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key events: Cuomo's orders leading to nursing home deaths, Florida's different approach, Arizona and Texas's refusal to mandate masks, the role of protests, and the political divide. Then, I'll note the consequences like threats against health workers and Trump's comments.

Now, I'll structure the summary, ensuring each point is concise and uses the moral words. I'll keep it under 200 words, starting with Cuomo's failures, then compare to Florida, discuss the other states' actions, mention the protests and political reactions, and conclude with the ongoing impact and Trump's loss.

I should make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms without making the summary too wordy. Let me draft it and check the word count.

SUMMARY: The article highlights failures in Democratic leadership during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s decision to force nursing homes to take back infected residents while barring testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers, resulting in fewer deaths. Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, though he eventually imposed a lockdown that helped control the outbreak. Meanwhile, Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate mask-wearing, with Arizona and Texas governors preventing cities from enforcing such measures. The role of mass protests in virus spikes remains unclear, but conservative backlash against social distancing rules has deepened mistrust in public health warnings. Public health workers face death threats, harassment, and armed protests. With Trump’s leadership, the U.S. lags behind countries with competent governance, as the virus continues to devastate red states. Trump’s claim to have limited casualties to 120,000 was reached, yet the pandemic persists, and Trump has lost the battle. END OF SUMMARY.
