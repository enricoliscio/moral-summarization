SUMMARY: The article discusses the failures of Democratic leaders in handling the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo's policies led to a high death toll in nursing homes. It contrasts this with the situation in red states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas, where governors have been resistant to implementing strict social distancing measures and mask-wearing mandates. The article also mentions the impact of mass protests and the growing political divide in the country, with conservatives becoming increasingly resistant to public health warnings. As a result, the author argues that red America lacks the political will to contain the virus, and the country will continue to suffer the consequences. Lindsey Graham's statement about limiting casualties is referenced as a grim milestone that has already been surpassed.
END OF SUMMARY.
