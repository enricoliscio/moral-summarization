SUMMARY:
The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's errors, such as forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and prohibiting testing, contributed to a catastrophe that killed over 6,000 people. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also criticizes the incompetent leadership of Arizona, Florida, and Texas, which have failed to implement simple measures like mask mandates. The author argues that the political will to contain the virus is lacking in "red America," where paranoia and resentment towards public health workers have led to death threats and harassment. As a result, the US will continue to be pummeled by the pandemic, unlike countries with competent leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
