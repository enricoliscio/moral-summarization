Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about how Democratic leaders, specifically Cuomo in New York, made some bad decisions early on in the pandemic. Cuomo forced nursing homes to take back COVID patients from hospitals and stopped testing them, which led to a lot of deaths in nursing homes. The article compares New York to Florida, where they didn't do that and had fewer deaths. So Cuomo's actions are criticized here.

Then it moves on to other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas, which aren't enforcing mask mandates. Governors there even blocked cities from making their own rules. The article mentions that there's some debate about whether protests caused COVID spikes, but liberals supporting the protests made conservatives think that social distancing is just a way to control people. This has led to resentment against public health workers, who are being threatened and harassed.

The article also talks about how the U.S. is struggling while other countries with better leadership are getting back to normal. Trump is mentioned, and his advisor Lindsey Graham made a comment about acceptable death tolls, which the article points out was reached, but Trump is already losing the battle against the pandemic.

So the moral framing here is pretty clear: the article is critical of Democratic leaders for their initial mistakes, but more so of Republican leaders for not taking the pandemic seriously and for the political divide that's making the situation worse. It's highlighting how partisanship is causing more deaths and preventing effective measures.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points without being too detailed. I should mention Cuomo's actions, the comparison with Florida, the lack of mask mandates in other states, the political divide, and the overall failure of leadership. Also, include the part about public health workers being targeted and the comparison to other countries. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral criticism is clear.

SUMMARY: The article highlights failures in pandemic response by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who mandated nursing homes to readmit COVID-19 patients without testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in New York nursing homes. In contrast, Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw fewer deaths. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, but other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to implement basic measures like mask mandates, with governors even blocking local restrictions. The article also notes the political divide, with conservatives viewing pandemic restrictions as hypocritical social control, fueled by liberal support for protests. Public health workers face threats and harassment, and the U.S. lags behind countries with competent leadership. Trump’s advisor, Lindsey Graham, downplayed the death toll, which has now reached 120,000, while Trump’s pandemic response has faltered. END OF SUMMARY.
