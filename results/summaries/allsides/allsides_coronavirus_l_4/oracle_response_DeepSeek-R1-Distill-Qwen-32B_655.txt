Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words from the article as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how Democratic leaders, especially Cuomo, made mistakes during the COVID-19 crisis in New York, leading to high nursing home deaths. In contrast, Florida had fewer deaths because they prohibited transfers. Cuomo eventually took action, but other states like Arizona and Texas didn't enforce mask mandates, which is a failure in leadership. The article also mentions the impact of protests and the backlash against public health workers.

I need to make sure to include words like "failures," "forced," "barred," "errors," "imposed," "prevented," "violence," "directed," "threats," "harassment," "leadership," "limited," and "lost." I should structure the summary to highlight the moral judgment, showing the negative actions and their consequences.

I'll start by mentioning Cuomo's failures, then the comparison with Florida. Next, I'll talk about the other states' inaction and the political issues. Finally, I'll end with the current death toll and Trump's loss. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points and use the moral words effectively.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral failures of Democratic leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back infected residents while barring testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths. In contrast, Florida’s prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer deaths. Cuomo’s errors exacerbated New York’s crisis, though he later imposed a lockdown to control the spread. Meanwhile, states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate masks, with Arizona and Texas even preventing cities from enforcing their own rules. The article also notes the role of mass protests in potentially spiking cases, with conservatives accusing liberals of hypocrisy. Public health workers faced death threats, harassment, and armed protests. The author criticizes the lack of political will in red states to contain the virus, contrasting it with countries with competent leadership. As the U.S. death toll reached 120,000, Trump’s allies downplayed the loss, but the war against the virus continues, with Trump having already lost it. END OF SUMMARY.
