Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about how different states handled the COVID-19 pandemic, especially focusing on New York, Florida, Arizona, Texas, and the federal response under Trump.

So, the key points are: Cuomo's policies in New York led to high nursing home deaths, Florida handled it better. Arizona and Texas didn't enforce mask mandates, and their governors even blocked cities from doing so. There's mention of protests possibly contributing to virus spikes, and political divisions on handling the pandemic. Public health workers are facing threats. Trump's comment about casualties is noted, and the situation in red states seems dire.

I should condense these points into a summary under 200 words. Make sure to include Cuomo's mistakes, Florida's better outcome, other states' inaction, political issues, and the overall impact. Also, mention Trump's comment and the comparison to other countries.

Let me structure it: Start with Cuomo's failures, contrast with Florida, then talk about Arizona and Texas's actions, mention the protests and political divide, public health threats, and conclude with Trump's statement and the ongoing crisis.

Need to keep it concise and within the word limit. Avoid too much detail on each point, just the main ideas.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the contrasting COVID-19 responses in different U.S. states and the political implications. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's flawed policies, such as forcing nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients without testing, led to over 6,000 deaths in nursing homes, while Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw fewer fatalities. Cuomo later implemented a lockdown, but states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to enforce mask mandates, with governors blocking local restrictions. The pandemic's resurgence has been linked to mass protests, though evidence is mixed. Conservative opposition to distancing measures has deepened, with public health workers facing threats and harassment. Meanwhile, Trump's administration downplayed the severity, with Lindsey Graham suggesting 120,000 deaths as a manageable threshold. As other countries recover, the U.S. struggles, highlighting a lack of political will in red states to control the virus. END OF SUMMARY.
