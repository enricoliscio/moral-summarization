SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back coronavirus patients without testing them led to a devastating outbreak, resulting in over 6,000 deaths. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a significantly lower death rate. The article also condemns Republican governors in Arizona and Texas for not implementing mask mandates and preventing cities from doing so. The author argues that the lack of political will to contain the virus, fueled by conservative paranoia and resentment, will hinder the country's ability to recover. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic, unlike countries with competent leadership, and that the Trump administration has already lost the battle against the virus.

END OF SUMMARY.
