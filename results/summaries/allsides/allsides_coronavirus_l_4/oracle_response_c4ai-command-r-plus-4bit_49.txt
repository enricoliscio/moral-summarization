SUMMARY: There have been devastating failures by Democratic leaders on the East Coast in response to the coronavirus outbreak. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, forced nursing homes to take back residents who had the virus, barred them from testing, and as a result, Covid-19 spread through the state's nursing facilities, killing thousands. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and has seen a lower percentage of nursing home residents die from the virus. Arizona, Florida, and Texas have been criticized for not mandating mask-wearing and preventing cities from instituting their own requirements. The lack of political will to contain the virus in red states, combined with Trump's incompetent leadership, means that the US will continue to be pummeled by the pandemic. Lindsey Graham once said that limiting casualties to 120,000 would be a success, and that number has now been surpassed.

END OF SUMMARY.
