Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they likely want a concise summary that maintains the original article's critical tone.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders in states like New York, Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Cuomo's actions, such as forcing nursing homes to take back COVID patients without testing, led to high fatalities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer deaths. The article also criticizes the lack of mask mandates in some states and the political divide over pandemic measures.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used and include as many as possible. Words like "failures," "forced," "barred," "errors," "violence," "threats," "harassment," "leadership," "limited," and "lost" are key here. I'll make sure these words are included to maintain the moral tone.

I should structure the summary to highlight Cuomo's mistakes, the contrast with Florida, the inaction in other states, the political backlash, and the overall failure of leadership. It's important to convey the criticism towards Cuomo and the Republican governors while noting the impact on public health workers.

I'll start by summarizing Cuomo's actions and their consequences, then compare with Florida. Next, I'll mention the lack of measures in Arizona, Texas, and Florida, and the political divide. Finally, I'll touch on the threats faced by health workers and the failure of leadership, ending with the ongoing pandemic despite other countries' progress.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all critical points. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, using the specified words to emphasize the negative actions and outcomes.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence includes the moral elements and flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure clarity and coherence.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral failures of Democratic leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back hospitalized residents without testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in New York nursing homes. In contrast, Florida’s prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer fatalities. Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, though he eventually imposed a lockdown to curb the spread. Meanwhile, Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate mask-wearing, with Arizona and Texas even preventing cities from implementing their own requirements. The article also notes the mixed evidence linking mass protests to COVID spikes, but conservative backlash against social distancing rules has deepened divisions. Public health workers face death threats, harassment, and armed protests, as the political will to contain the virus remains absent in red states. While other countries with competent leadership recover, the U.S. continues to struggle, with Trump’s rhetoric and actions further eroding trust. The pandemic rages on, and Trump has already “lost” the war. END OF SUMMARY.
