SUMMARY: The incompetent and immoral response to the coronavirus pandemic by Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, as well as by Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, has led to devastating consequences, with thousands of unnecessary deaths. Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back residents hospitalized for coronavirus without testing led to a deadly outbreak in New York's nursing homes. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a lower death rate. The current surge in cases in red states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas is due in part to the failure of their governors to take basic measures to control the spread of the virus, such as mandating mask-wearing. The politicization of the pandemic by conservatives and the backlash against public health workers have made it difficult to contain the virus in red America. The lack of competent leadership in the United States has led to a continuous pummeling, while other countries are slowly returning to normal. The war against the coronavirus has already been lost by Trump, with the death toll surpassing 120,000.
