SUMMARY:
The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the devastating failures of leadership in the United States, particularly among Democratic leaders like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo's errors contributed to the catastrophe in New York, where his policies led to a high death toll in nursing homes. Meanwhile, states like Florida and Arizona have failed to take necessary precautions, such as mandating mask-wearing, to contain the virus. The already paranoid and resentful culture of the modern right has now turned against public health workers, who are facing death threats, harassment, and armed protesters at their homes. The lack of political will to contain the virus in red America means that the country will continue to be pummeled by the pandemic. Trump's incompetent leadership has already lost the war against COVID-19, with the death toll surpassing 120,000.
