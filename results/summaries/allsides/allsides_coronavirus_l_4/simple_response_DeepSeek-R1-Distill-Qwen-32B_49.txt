Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about how during the COVID-19 outbreak in March, Democratic leaders, specifically Governor Cuomo of New York, made some bad decisions. He forced nursing homes to take back COVID patients from hospitals without testing them, which led to a lot of deaths in nursing homes. Florida, which didn't do that, had fewer deaths. Cuomo eventually imposed a lockdown, but the article questions how much credit he deserves because of his earlier mistakes.

Then it compares this to Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who haven't mandated masks and even blocked cities from doing so. There's also mention of how mass protests against police violence might have contributed to virus spikes, but liberals supporting the protests made conservatives suspicious of social distancing as a tool for control. Public health workers are being threatened, and the article suggests that red states lack the political will to contain the virus.

The article ends by noting that while other countries with good leadership are recovering, the U.S. is still struggling. It mentions Lindsey Graham's comment about casualties and how the death toll reached that number, implying Trump's failure.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to blame Democratic leaders for initial failures but also heavily criticize Republican governors for not taking action and undermining public health measures. The summary should reflect that both sides made mistakes, but the focus is on the political divide leading to the pandemic's worse impact in the U.S.

I should structure the summary to first mention Cuomo's mistakes, then contrast with Florida, then move to Republican governors' inaction, the political backlash against public health, and the overall failure of leadership leading to the ongoing crisis. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the comparison to other countries and Trump's loss.

Let me make sure to include key points: Cuomo's order leading to nursing home deaths, Florida's better outcome, lockdown imposition, Republican governors' refusal to mandate masks, blocking city orders, protests and political divide, threats to health workers, political will lacking, and the ongoing pandemic while others recover.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral failures in pandemic response, particularly by Democratic leaders like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose decision to send COVID-19 patients back to nursing homes without testing led to thousands of deaths. In contrast, Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw fewer fatalities. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, but his initial errors cast doubt on his leadership. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas have refused to mandate masks and even blocked cities from implementing their own measures. The article also notes the politicization of the pandemic, with conservatives viewing social distancing as hypocritical social control, leading to threats against public health workers. The U.S. lags behind other countries in pandemic containment, with Trump's leadership failing to curb the virus. As the death toll reached 120,000, the article underscores the ongoing crisis and the lack of political will to address it effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
