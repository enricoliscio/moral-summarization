SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back coronavirus-infected residents without testing, leading to the deaths of over 6,000 people. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article criticizes Cuomo's errors and notes that even when he eventually rose to the occasion, his actions were too little, too late. Meanwhile, Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to take simple measures like mandating mask-wearing, and have even prevented cities from instituting their own requirements. The article condemns the paranoia and resentment directed at public health workers, who have faced death threats and harassment. The author argues that the lack of competent leadership has led to the country's continued struggles with the pandemic, with the death toll now surpassing 120,000. The article concludes that Trump has already lost the "war" against the virus.
