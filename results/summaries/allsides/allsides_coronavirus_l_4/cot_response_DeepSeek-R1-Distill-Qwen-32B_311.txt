Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that have a moral connotation. Let me read through it again.

The article starts by talking about the failure of Democratic leaders when COVID cases exploded. So "failure" is a moral word here. Cuomo is mentioned for forcing nursing homes to take back residents, which is a negative action, so "forcing" might be another moral term. He barred testing, so "barred" is negative. The result was that COVID tore through nursing homes, killing many, which uses "devastating," "tore through," and "killed." These are strong moral words indicating the severity of the failure.

In contrast, Florida prohibited transfers and had a lower death rate, so "prohibited" is a moral action, and "only" is used to show a better outcome. Cuomo's errors contributed to New York's catastrophe, so "errors" and "catastrophe" are moral terms. Cuomo eventually rose to the occasion, but it's unclear how much credit he deserves, so "credit" and "rose" might not be moral, but "eventually" isn't either. 

Arizona, Florida, and Texas aren't mandating masks, so "mandating" is a positive action they're not doing. Governors prevented cities from instituting requirements, so "prevented" is negative. The article mentions that evidence about protests causing spikes is mixed, but liberals supported the protests, leading conservatives to view social distancing as hypocritical social control. So "hypocritical," "social control," "paranoia," and "resentment" are moral terms here.

Public health workers face death threats and harassment, so "death threats," "harassment," and "armed protesters" are all negative moral actions. The article then contrasts countries with competent leadership returning to normal, while the U.S. continues to be pummeled. "Competent," "pummeled" are moral terms. Trump's sycophant Lindsey Graham mentioned limiting casualties as a success, but the death toll reached 120,000, so "Trump sycophant," "casualties," "war," and "lost" are moral words.

So compiling all the moral words: failure, forcing, barred, devastating, tore through, killed, prohibited, only, errors, catastrophe, credit, rose, mandating, prevented, evidence, mixed, liberal, support, demonstrations, solidified, conviction, conservatives, strict, hypocritical, social control, paranoia, resentment, culture, modern right, directed, warning, ongoing dangers, public health workers, death threats, harassment, armed protesters, homes, no matter, bad, red America, political will, contain, virus, come, countries, competent leadership, haltingly, return, normal, pummeled, mid-May, coronavirus, death toll, Trump sycophant, fatalities, much beyond, limited, casualties, war, lost.

Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral connotation. I should focus on the ones that clearly carry a moral judgment, like failure, forcing, barred, devastating, killed, prohibited, errors, catastrophe, mandating, prevented, hypocritical, social control, paranoia, resentment, death threats, harassment, armed, pummeled, competent, lost.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these moral words as possible while condensing the article. The main points are Cuomo's actions leading to high deaths in NY nursing homes, Florida's better approach, the political response in Arizona, Texas, and Florida not mandating masks, the impact of protests on virus spread, the backlash against public health workers, and the comparison with other countries. Also, Trump's handling and the death toll reaching 120k.

I should structure the summary to highlight the failures, Cuomo's role, the contrast with Florida, the refusal to mandate masks, the political divide, the threats against health workers, and the ongoing crisis despite other countries recovering. I'll make sure to use the moral words to frame the issues negatively where applicable.

**Summary:**

The article highlights the moral failures in the COVID-19 response, particularly by Democratic leaders. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back infected residents without testing led to a devastating toll, killing over 6,000 residents. In contrast, Florida's prohibition of such transfers resulted in a lower death rate. Cuomo's errors exacerbated New York's catastrophe, though he later implemented a lockdown. Meanwhile, Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate mask-wearing, with governors preventing cities from enacting their own measures. The article notes the mixed impact of protests on virus spikes, but conservatives view social distancing as hypocritical control, fueled by paranoia and resentment. Public health workers face death threats and harassment. The U.S. lags behind countries with competent leadership, as Trump's administration struggles, with the death toll reaching 120,000, a mark Trump's ally Lindsey Graham had deemed a success. The war against the virus continues, but Trump has lost it. **End of Summary.**
