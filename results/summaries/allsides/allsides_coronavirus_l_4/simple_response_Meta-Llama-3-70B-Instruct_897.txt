SUMMARY:

The article critiques the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who made devastating decisions that led to the deaths of over 6,000 nursing home residents. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on transferring infected patients to nursing homes resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also condemns the lack of action by Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who refused to mandate mask-wearing and even prevented cities from doing so. This inaction is attributed to a culture of paranoia and resentment on the right, which views public health measures as social control. The article warns that without competent leadership, the US will continue to suffer from the pandemic, while other countries with effective leadership are slowly returning to normal.

END OF SUMMARY.
