SUMMARY: When coronavirus cases surged on the East Coast in March, Democratic leaders displayed devastating failures. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, forced nursing homes to accept hospitalized coronavirus patients and prohibited them from testing these residents. This decision resulted in a devastating outcome, with the virus killing over 6,000 people in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and experienced a lower death rate. Cuomo eventually rose to the occasion, imposing a lockdown that helped curb the spread. However, states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to mandate even simple measures like mask-wearing. The governors of Arizona and Texas went as far as preventing cities from implementing their own mask requirements. The country's divided political landscape has further complicated the situation, with conservative resentment and paranoia directed at those warning about the pandemic's dangers. Public health workers have faced threats, harassment, and protests. The lack of competent leadership in these states raises doubts about their ability to contain the virus. America continues to be ravaged by the virus, with Trump's inadequate response resulting in a loss of the war against COVID-19.
END OF SUMMARY.
