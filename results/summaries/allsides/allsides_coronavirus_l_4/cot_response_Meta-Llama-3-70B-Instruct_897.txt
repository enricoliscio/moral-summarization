SUMMARY:
Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, made devastating failures in their response to the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a catastrophe that killed over 6,000 nursing home residents. Cuomo's errors, including forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring testing, contributed to the calamity. In contrast, states like Florida, which prohibited such transfers, had a much lower death rate. Meanwhile, governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas have been slow to act, refusing to mandate mask-wearing and even preventing cities from instituting their own requirements. This lack of competent leadership has led to a sense of paranoia and resentment among conservatives, who see social distancing rules as hypocritical tools of social control. As a result, public health workers have faced death threats and harassment, and the country continues to be pummeled by the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
