SUMMARY: The article discusses the devastating impact of the coronavirus on the East Coast, particularly in New York, where Democratic leaders made critical mistakes in their response to the pandemic. Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to accept residents who had been hospitalized for COVID-19, without testing, resulted in a high death toll. In contrast, states like Florida that prohibited such transfers had lower mortality rates. The article also criticizes the lack of action by leaders in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, where cases are surging, for their failure to mandate mask-wearing and other simple measures to control the spread of the virus. It notes the political divide in the country, with many conservatives dismissing social distancing rules as a form of social control, and the resulting threats and harassment faced by public health workers. The article concludes by noting that the US will continue to be severely impacted by the pandemic due to a lack of competent leadership, while other countries are returning to normal.
