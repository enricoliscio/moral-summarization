SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the leadership of Democratic governors, particularly Andrew Cuomo of New York, for their devastating failures in handling the coronavirus outbreak in March. Cuomo's order to force nursing homes to take back infected residents led to the deaths of over 6,000 people, compared to Florida's 1.6% death rate. In contrast, Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to take basic measures like mandating mask-wearing, and have even prevented cities from implementing their own safety measures. The article argues that this lack of action is fueled by a paranoid and resentful culture on the right, which views public health measures as a form of social control. As a result, public health workers have faced death threats and harassment. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic due to a lack of competent leadership, unlike other countries that are slowly returning to normal.
