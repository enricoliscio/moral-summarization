Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders in New York, Florida, and other states. Cuomo's decisions led to high fatalities in nursing homes, while Florida had fewer deaths. The article also contrasts this with Republican states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida, which didn't enforce mask mandates and even blocked cities from doing so. There's mention of the impact of protests and the political divide, with public health workers facing threats.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral judgment, like Cuomo's failures and the Republican governors' inaction. I should also highlight the consequences, such as the high death toll and the comparison with other countries. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly, ending with the specified tokens.

I should avoid any markdown and ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Cuomo's actions, moving to Republican states, and ending with the political implications and Trump's comment. I'll make sure to include key numbers and the comparison between states to emphasize the moral points.

SUMMARY: The article highlights failures in pandemic response by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who mandated nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients without testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in New York nursing homes. In contrast, Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw a much lower death rate. Cuomo eventually implemented lockdowns, but his initial mistakes contributed to the crisis. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas refused to mandate masks, with some even blocking cities from enforcing such measures. The article also notes the politicization of the pandemic, with conservatives opposing social distancing and public health workers facing threats. Despite the U.S. surpassing 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump and his supporters downplay the severity, leaving the country struggling to contain the virus while others recover. END OF SUMMARY.
