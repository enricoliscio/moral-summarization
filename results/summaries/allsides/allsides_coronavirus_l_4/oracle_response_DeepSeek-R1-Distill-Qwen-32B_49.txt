Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Democratic leaders, specifically Cuomo in New York, made mistakes during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cuomo forced nursing homes to take back residents who were hospitalized, and he barred them from testing. This led to a lot of deaths in nursing homes. In contrast, Florida didn't have as many deaths because they prohibited such transfers. Cuomo eventually imposed a lockdown which helped, but other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas aren't doing enough, like mandating masks. Governors in Arizona and Texas even prevented cities from making their own rules. There's also mention of mass protests and how they might have contributed to virus spikes. Liberals supporting the protests made conservatives think that social distancing was hypocritical. Public health workers are facing threats and harassment. The article ends by saying that while other countries with good leadership are recovering, the U.S. is still struggling because of political issues. Trump's comments about casualties are mentioned, and the article says Trump has lost the battle.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like failures, forced, barred, prohibited, errors, imposed, helped, prevented, violence, threats, harassment, leadership, limited, lost. I should make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by mentioning Cuomo's failures and the consequences. Then compare with Florida. Then talk about Cuomo's later actions. Next, discuss the other states not doing enough, especially about mask mandates. Mention the protests and the political divide. Highlight the threats against health workers. Finally, contrast the U.S. situation with other countries and Trump's loss.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral word is used where it fits naturally.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral failures of Democratic leaders during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back infected residents and barred testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths. In contrast, Florida's prohibition of such transfers resulted in fewer fatalities. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, helping curb the spread, but states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate masks or prevent local measures. Mass protests over police violence may have contributed to virus spikes, with liberals' support reinforcing conservative suspicions of social distancing as hypocritical control. Public health workers faced death threats and harassment. The U.S. struggles to contain the virus, while other nations with competent leadership recover. Trump's dismissal of casualties as "limited" contrasts with the reality, as the virus continues to devastate, and Trump has "lost" the battle. END OF SUMMARY.
