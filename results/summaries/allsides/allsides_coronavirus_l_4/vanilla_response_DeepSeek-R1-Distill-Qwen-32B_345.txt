Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the response to the coronavirus in different states, especially comparing New York, Florida, Arizona, and Texas. It mentions Governor Cuomo's decisions leading to high fatalities in nursing homes, while Florida had fewer deaths. Then it contrasts this with Arizona and Texas not enforcing mask mandates and even preventing cities from doing so. 

The article also discusses the impact of mass protests on virus spikes and how political divides are affecting the pandemic response. There's mention of public health workers facing threats and the overall failure of leadership in red states. It ends by noting that while other countries are recovering, the U.S. is still struggling, and Trump's comments about casualties.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight Cuomo's mistakes, the contrast with Florida, the lack of measures in Arizona and Texas, the political polarization, and the ongoing challenges in the U.S. compared to other countries.

Let me structure it: start with Cuomo's actions and their consequences, compare with Florida, then move to Arizona and Texas's inaction, touch on the protests and political divide, mention the threats to health workers, and conclude with the U.S. pandemic situation and Trump's comments.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Also, avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the contrasting responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by different U.S. states, highlighting failures in leadership and political polarization. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's decisions, such as forcing nursing homes to accept COVID-positive residents without testing, led to over 6,000 deaths in nursing homes, while Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw fewer fatalities. Arizona and Texas governors resisted mask mandates and even blocked cities from enforcing them. The pandemic's resurgence has been influenced by mass protests, with conservatives viewing social distancing as hypocritical social control. Public health workers face threats and harassment, and red states lack political will to contain the virus. Meanwhile, countries with effective leadership are recovering, while the U.S. continues to struggle. Trump's dismissive comments about casualties underscore the federal government's failure to control the outbreak. END OF SUMMARY.
