SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed devastating failures of leadership in the United States, particularly among Democratic leaders. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo's errors contributed to the spread of the virus in nursing homes, resulting in thousands of deaths. In contrast, states like Florida that prohibited similar transfers have seen lower fatality rates. The current surge in cases in Arizona, Florida, and Texas is exacerbated by the governors' refusal to mandate mask-wearing and their hindrance of local efforts to do so. The recent mass protests against police violence have further complicated the situation, with conservative skepticism of social distancing measures and public health workers facing threats and harassment. The country's incompetent leadership has led to a continued pummeling by the virus while other nations begin to return to normal. The human cost is immense, with deaths far exceeding the number that Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham once claimed would indicate success in the "war" against COVID-19. America is losing this war due to its leaders' failures and indifference to the ongoing dangers. END OF SUMMARY.
