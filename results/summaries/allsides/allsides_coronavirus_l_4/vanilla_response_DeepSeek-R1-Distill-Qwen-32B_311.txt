Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in the U.S., focusing on the political responses from different states. They mentioned that the summary should be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It starts by talking about how Democratic leaders, like Cuomo in New York, made mistakes early on by forcing nursing homes to take back COVID patients without testing, leading to high deaths. Then it contrasts this with Florida, which prohibited such transfers and had fewer deaths. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, which helped, but other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas aren't enforcing mask mandates. There's also mention of mass protests possibly contributing to virus spikes and the political divide over social distancing. Public health workers are facing threats, and Trump's handling is criticized, with the death toll hitting a significant number.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by highlighting Cuomo's initial mistakes and the consequences in New York. Then, contrast with Florida's approach. Mention Cuomo's later lockdown. Then, talk about the other states not enforcing masks and the political backlash. Include the impact of protests and the divide. Finally, touch on Trump's handling and the death toll.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, hits all key points without getting too detailed, and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it to first talk about Cuomo and New York, then the other states, the political issues, and conclude with the overall impact and Trump's role.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring each sentence adds value without redundancy. Also, I need to maintain an objective tone, summarizing the facts without bias.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure it starts and ends with the correct tokens and that it's under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content, including the statistics and the comparison between states.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic by some Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to accept COVID-positive residents without testing, leading to over 6,000 deaths in nursing homes. In contrast, Florida, which prohibited such transfers, saw fewer deaths. Cuomo later imposed a lockdown, but states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate masks or allow local mask requirements. The article also highlights the politicization of the pandemic, with conservatives viewing social distancing as hypocritical, and public health workers facing threats. As other countries recover, the U.S. continues to struggle, with Trump downplaying the death toll, which recently reached 120,000. The political will to control the virus remains lacking in many red states. END OF SUMMARY.
