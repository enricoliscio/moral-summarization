SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the coronavirus outbreak. Cuomo's errors, such as forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring testing, led to catastrophic consequences, including over 6,000 deaths in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also criticizes the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who failed to impose simple measures like mask-wearing and even prevented cities from doing so. This inaction is attributed to a culture of paranoia and resentment on the right, which has led to death threats and harassment against public health workers. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic due to a lack of competent leadership, citing Trump's sycophant Lindsey Graham's misguided comments on limiting casualties.
