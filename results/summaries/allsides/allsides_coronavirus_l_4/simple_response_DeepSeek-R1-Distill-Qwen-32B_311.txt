Alright, so I'm trying to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they need a concise summary that reflects the author's perspective on the issue.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how different states handled the COVID-19 pandemic, especially focusing on New York, Florida, Arizona, Texas, and the federal response. The author is critical of Cuomo's initial decisions, pointing out that they led to high nursing home deaths, while Florida fared better by not transferring patients. Cuomo eventually took action, but other states like Arizona and Texas didn't enforce mask mandates, leading to worse outcomes.

The article also touches on the political divide, with conservatives opposing social distancing and targeting public health workers. The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include the key moral points: Cuomo's failures, state responses, political polarization, and the federal government's mishandling.

I should structure the summary to highlight these elements, making sure the moral judgment against Cuomo and the Republican governors is clear. Also, mention the impact of political polarization on the pandemic response. I'll keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed. I'll end with the required tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose decisions led to devastating consequences in nursing homes. Cuomo forced nursing homes to accept COVID-positive residents without testing, resulting in over 6,000 deaths in New York’s facilities, compared to a much lower death rate in Florida, which avoided such transfers. While Cuomo eventually imposed a lockdown, other states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas failed to mandate masks or restrict gatherings, exacerbating the crisis. The article highlights the political divide, with conservatives opposing social distancing as a "hypocritical tool of control," leading to harassment and threats against public health workers. The author contrasts the U.S. response with countries that have competent leadership, suggesting that the U.S. will continue to suffer due to political inaction. Trump’s downplaying of the pandemic and the lack of a unified response have worsened the situation, with the death toll surpassing 120,000. The article concludes that Trump has lost the battle against the virus, emphasizing the moral and political failures of the response. END OF SUMMARY.
