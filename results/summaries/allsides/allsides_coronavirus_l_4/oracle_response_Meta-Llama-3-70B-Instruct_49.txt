SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, during the coronavirus outbreak. Cuomo's errors, including forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring them from testing, led to a catastrophic 6% death rate among nursing home residents. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower 1.6% death rate. Meanwhile, Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to impose simple measures like mask-wearing, and have even prevented cities from doing so. The article argues that this lack of leadership has contributed to a culture of paranoia and resentment, with public health workers facing death threats and harassment. As a result, the country's response to the pandemic has been severely hindered, and the death toll continues to rise. The article concludes that the US has already lost the war against the virus due to incompetent leadership.
