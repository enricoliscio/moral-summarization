SUMMARY: The article discusses the contrasting responses to the coronavirus pandemic by Democratic and Republican leaders in the United States, and the devastating impact it had on nursing home residents. In New York, Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated that nursing homes take back residents who had been hospitalized for coronavirus, without testing them for the virus. This decision led to a high death toll in the state's nursing homes. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a lower death rate among nursing home residents. The article also criticizes the response of Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who have not mandated mask-wearing and have prevented cities from instituting their own requirements. The recent mass protests over police violence and liberal support for them have further solidified conservative skepticism of social distancing rules. The article concludes by highlighting the lack of political will to contain the virus in red states and expressing concern that the country will continue to be severely affected by the pandemic. It also mentions a statement by Lindsey Graham, who downplayed the severity of the pandemic, and notes that the US has now surpassed the predicted number of fatalities.
