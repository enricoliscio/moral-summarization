SUMMARY: There have been devastating failures by Democratic leaders on the East Coast in handling the coronavirus outbreak. New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo forced nursing homes to take back residents who had the virus and barred them from testing, resulting in a high death toll. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a lower percentage of deaths. Arizona, Florida, and Texas have not mandated mask-wearing or taken strong lockdown measures, and their governors have prevented cities from instituting their own requirements. The ongoing protests against police violence have created a divide, with liberals supporting the demonstrations and conservatives viewing social distancing rules as hypocritical. Public health workers have faced threats and harassment, and the country lacks the political will to contain the virus effectively. The incompetence of leadership has led to a continuous rise in cases and casualties, with the US death toll reaching 120,000. Trump has already lost the war against the virus due to his administration's failures to limit the casualties.
END OF SUMMARY.
