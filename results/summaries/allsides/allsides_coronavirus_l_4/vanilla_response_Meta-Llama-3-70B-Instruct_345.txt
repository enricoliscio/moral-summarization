SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who forced nursing homes to take back infected residents and prohibited testing, leading to a high death toll. In contrast, Florida prohibited such transfers and had a much lower death rate. The article also condemns the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who have not mandated mask-wearing and have prevented cities from instituting their own requirements. The article suggests that the political will to contain the virus is lacking, particularly among conservatives who view social distancing measures as a tool of social control. As a result, public health workers have faced death threats and harassment. The article concludes that the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic, unlike countries with competent leadership, and notes that the US has just reached a death toll of 120,000.
