SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's order to force nursing homes to take back coronavirus-infected residents without testing them led to devastating consequences, with over 6,000 deaths in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a much lower death rate. The article also condemns Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas for not implementing simple measures like mask mandates, and for preventing cities from instituting their own requirements. The article suggests that conservative paranoia and resentment towards public health measures have hindered the response to the pandemic, and that the country's lack of competent leadership will continue to worsen the situation.

END OF SUMMARY.
