SUMMARY:
Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, made devastating failures in handling the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a catastrophe that killed over 6,000 nursing home residents. Cuomo's errors, including forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring testing, contributed to the calamity. In contrast, Republican-led states like Florida, Arizona, and Texas have failed to take simple measures like mandating mask-wearing, allowing the virus to spread further. The hypocrisy of liberal support for mass protests has fueled paranoia and resentment among conservatives, leading to a lack of political will to contain the virus. As a result, public health workers have faced death threats and harassment, and the country remains in a state of war against the pandemic, with no end in sight. END OF SUMMARY.
