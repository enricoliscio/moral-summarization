SUMMARY: The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the moral failures of political leaders in the United States, particularly among Republican governors and the Trump administration. In New York, Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo made devastating mistakes by forcing nursing homes to take back residents infected with COVID-19, resulting in thousands of deaths. Despite this, Cuomo eventually recognized the severity of the situation and imposed a lockdown that helped curb the spread. However, Republican-led states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to take similar action, even resisting simple measures such as mandating mask-wearing. The article argues that the conservative culture of paranoia and resentment has led to a dangerous disregard for public health warnings, with public health workers facing threats and harassment. As the death toll surpasses 120,000, it is clear that Trump has lost the war against the virus due to his incompetence and the failures of Republican leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
