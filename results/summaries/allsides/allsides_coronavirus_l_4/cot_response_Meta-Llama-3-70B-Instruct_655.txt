SUMMARY:
The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo's errors, such as forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring testing, contributed to a catastrophe that killed over 6,000 people. In contrast, states like Florida, which prohibited such transfers, had a much lower death rate. The article also criticizes the lack of action from governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who failed to mandate mask-wearing and even prevented cities from doing so. This lack of competent leadership has led to a sense of paranoia and resentment among conservatives, who view social distancing rules as hypocritical. As a result, public health workers have faced death threats and harassment. The article concludes that the US will continue to be pummeled by the pandemic due to the lack of political will to contain it. END OF SUMMARY.
