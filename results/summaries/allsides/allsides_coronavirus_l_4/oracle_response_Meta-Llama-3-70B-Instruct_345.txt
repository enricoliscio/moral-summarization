SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the coronavirus crisis. Cuomo's errors, such as forcing nursing homes to take back infected residents and barring them from testing, contributed to the catastrophic death toll of over 6,000 people in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also criticizes the lack of action by governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, who failed to impose simple measures like mask-wearing, and even prevented cities from doing so. The author condemns the paranoia and resentment directed at public health workers, who have faced death threats and harassment. The article concludes that the country's incompetent leadership will continue to hinder efforts to contain the virus, and that Trump has already lost the "war" against the pandemic.
