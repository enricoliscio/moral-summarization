SUMMARY: The United States is facing a devastating coronavirus outbreak, with Democratic leaders making critical errors and Republican leaders refusing to take necessary precautions. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to accept residents hospitalized with COVID-19 without testing resulted in a tragic loss of life. Meanwhile, Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to implement basic safety measures like mandating mask-wearing, and their governors actively prevented cities from doing so. The country's incompetent leadership has resulted in a death toll of over 120,000, with no end to the pandemic in sight. The modern right's paranoia and resentment have led to threats and harassment directed at public health workers, and the political will to contain the virus in red states seems lacking. As a result, the US will continue to be pummeled by the pandemic while other countries with competent leadership begin to return to normal. Trump has already lost the war against the coronavirus, and his administration's failure to lead has had deadly consequences.
END OF SUMMARY.
