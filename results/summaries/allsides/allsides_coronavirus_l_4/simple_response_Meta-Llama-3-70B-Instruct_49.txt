SUMMARY:

The article highlights the devastating failures of Democratic leaders, particularly New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuomo's decision to force nursing homes to take back infected residents and bar them from testing led to a catastrophic outcome, with over 6,000 deaths in New York's nursing facilities. In contrast, Florida's prohibition on such transfers resulted in a significantly lower death rate. The article also criticizes Republican-led states, such as Arizona and Texas, for failing to implement basic measures like mask mandates, and for preventing cities from instituting their own requirements. The author argues that the lack of political will to contain the virus is rooted in the paranoia and resentment of the modern right, which has led to harassment and death threats against public health workers. As a result, the US will continue to struggle with the pandemic, unlike countries with competent leadership.
