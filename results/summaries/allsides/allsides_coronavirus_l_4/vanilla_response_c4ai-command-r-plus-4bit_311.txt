SUMMARY: The article discusses the contrasting responses to the coronavirus pandemic in Democratic and Republican-led states in the US. It highlights the failures of Democratic leaders in New York, where a mandate forced nursing homes to take back residents hospitalized for coronavirus without testing, leading to a higher death rate compared to Florida. It also criticizes the lack of action in Arizona, Florida, and Texas, where simple measures like mandating mask-wearing have not been implemented. The article suggests that the support of liberal protests against police violence has fueled conservative skepticism of social distancing rules, leading to paranoia and resentment directed at public health workers. The political divide is making it difficult to contain the virus in red states, while competent leadership in other countries is successfully curbing the spread. The article concludes by noting that the US death toll has already surpassed the number considered an acceptable limit by Trump supporter Lindsey Graham, indicating that Trump has lost the war against the virus.
