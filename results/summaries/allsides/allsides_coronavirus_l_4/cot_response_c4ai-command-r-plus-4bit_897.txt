SUMMARY:
The United States is losing the war against the coronavirus pandemic due to devastating errors by political leaders. In March, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made catastrophic decisions that led to the deaths of thousands of nursing home residents. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Arizona, Florida, and Texas have failed to mandate mask-wearing or other simple measures to contain the virus. The paranoia and resentment of the modern right, directed at public health workers trying to warn about the dangers of the pandemic, further hinder efforts to control the virus in red America. The country continues to be pummeled by the virus while other nations with competent leadership return to normalcy. Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham set a grim benchmark of 120,000 deaths as a measure of success, and the country has now surpassed that number. The war rages on, but Trump has already lost it due to the incompetence and hypocrisy displayed by his administration and conservative governors.
END OF SUMMARY.
