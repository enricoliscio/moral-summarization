SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a parallel outbreak of disinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus' spread, misinformation and conspiracy theories have exploded online, spreading as fast as the virus itself. The internet has become a breeding ground for nefarious claims, such as 5G Wi-Fi causing the virus, which are not only false but also dangerous. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void filled by misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. Donald Trump's repeated lies and misleading statements have been particularly disingenuous, imperiling countless lives. It is essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, which only hinders public health efforts and creates more doubt and panic. We must prioritize facts and critical thinking to protect ourselves and others from this deadly pandemic.
