SUMMARY: 
Disinformation regarding the coronavirus is posing a serious threat to stability and public safety. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 crisis and implements social distancing measures, a parallel outbreak of misinformation is festering online. People seeking clarity and reassurance are instead finding a sea of confusion, with disinformation spreading rapidly through social media platforms. This information crisis is unprecedented, as the world has never faced a pandemic in such a technologically advanced era. The public is being bombarded with false claims, such as the notion that garlic or water can prevent infection or that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi. These lies are dangerous and hinder accurate information from reaching the public, endangering countless lives. 

The article highlights how disinformation muddies public discussions and exhausts critical thinking on a mass level. It obliterates truth and sows uncertainty, ensuring that even when facts are reported, they are drowned out by lies and half-truths. This crisis is made worse by the mismanagement of the federal government, with Donald Trump repeatedly misleading the public and spreading false information about the virus's threat. The combination of online disinformation and authority figures spreading lies is creating a dangerous hindrance to public health efforts. In a time where every hour counts and lives hang in the balance, it is crucial to hold ourselves accountable and refrain from abetting the proliferation of disinformation.
