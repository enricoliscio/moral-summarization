Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I should read through the article to identify the main points and ensure the summary uses those words effectively.

The article talks about disinformation during COVID-19, its spread, examples, and the impact of misinformation from both online sources and the government. It emphasizes the threat to public health and the consequences of lies and misinformation.

I'll start by highlighting the main issues: disinformation as a threat, its spread, examples of claims, the role of social media, government mismanagement, and the consequences like confusion and panic.

I need to make sure to include words like disinformation, threat, spread, claims, nefarious, lied, misled, consequences, etc. I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the problem, examples, sources, and ending with the call for responsibility.

Let me draft a concise version, keeping it under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the moral framing without losing the essence of the article.

SUMMARY:  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a dangerous crisis: the rapid spread of disinformation, which poses a significant threat to public health and stability. As the virus spreads globally, so too does misinformation, with claims ranging from harmless myths about garlic and water to nefarious theories linking the virus to 5G or bioweapons. These falsehoods, often amplified by social media, muddy public understanding and erode trust in objective truth. The federal governmentâ€™s mismanagement has further fueled confusion, with the White House repeatedly lying and misleading the public, imperiling lives and hindering efforts to inform and protect the public. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys public consensus and critical thinking, sowing seeds of uncertainty and ensuring that even truthful information is swallowed in a sea of lies. At a time when every day and hour matters, the proliferation of disinformation from online sources and political leaders alike only exacerbates panic and squanders resources that could be used to educate the public. The moral imperative is clear: we must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting this dangerous spread, ensuring that facts and critical analysis guide our response to the pandemic.  
END OF SUMMARY.
