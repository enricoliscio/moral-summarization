SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a parallel outbreak of disinformation and misinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, false claims and conspiracy theories spread rapidly, undermining public health efforts. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void filled by misinformation, which can have serious and dangerous consequences. Even the White House has contributed to the spread of disinformation, with President Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the coronavirus. This not only misinforms but also exhausts the public's critical thinking, destroys confidence in objective truth, and hinders public consensus. It is essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, which only creates doubt and panic, and instead educate the public on facts and ways to protect themselves.
