SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a unique threat to global stability and society, with disinformation and misinformation spreading rapidly online. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, false claims and conspiracy theories about the virus are spreading as fast as the virus itself. These lies, including those from the White House, have the potential to reap serious and dangerous consequences, imperiling countless lives. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys the institution of public consensus, creating doubt and panic, and squandering precious time and resources. It is crucial that we hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, whether it comes from the web or the president himself. We must prioritize educating the public on the facts and ways they can protect themselves, and promote critical thinking to combat the spread of disinformation.
