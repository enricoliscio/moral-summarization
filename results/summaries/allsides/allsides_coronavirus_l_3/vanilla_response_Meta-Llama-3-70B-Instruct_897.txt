SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new threat to society: disinformation. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have exploded online. Examples include claims that eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection, or that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or is a bioweapon. However, none of these claims are true. The coronavirus is a real and dangerous virus that has spread quickly around the world, causing thousands of deaths and millions of job losses. Disinformation is not only spread online but also by authorities, such as the White House, which can have serious and dangerous consequences. It muddies public discussions, exhausts critical thinking, and destroys public consensus. In a time where every day counts, it is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not spreading disinformation and to educate the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves.
