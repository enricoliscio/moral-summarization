SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a unique threat to global stability, with disinformation spreading rapidly online and posing a significant danger to public health and safety. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus's spread, misinformation and conspiracy theories are filling the void left by the absence of clear facts and strong leadership. Disinformation is being spread through social media, with false claims about the virus's origin, prevention, and treatment spreading like wildfire. Even the White House has contributed to the misinformation, with Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the virus. This disinformation is not only harmful but also exhausts the public's critical thinking, destroys confidence in objective truth, and hinders public health efforts. It is essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and to educate the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves. Every day counts, and lives literally hang in the balance.
