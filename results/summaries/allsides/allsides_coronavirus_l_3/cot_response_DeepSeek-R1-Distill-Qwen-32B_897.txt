Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. 

Starting with the first step, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "threat," "crisis," "dangerous," "misleading," "deceit," "lies," "fraudulent," "dishonest," "obfuscation," "exploitation," "deception," "manipulation," "abuse," "abate," "hinder," "undermine," "erode," "undermine," "jeopardize," "endanger," "squander," "abet," "hinder," "undermine," "undermine," and "jeopardize" stand out as they express judgment or evaluation.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. The article discusses how disinformation about COVID-19 is as dangerous as the virus itself, with false claims and government misinformation exacerbating the crisis. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the threat posed by disinformation, the lies from the government, and the impact on public trust and safety.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the problem of disinformation, moving to specific examples like government lies, and concluding with the consequences on public consensus and health efforts. I'll use the identified moral words to emphasize the severity and ethical implications of the situation.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is concise, clear, and sticks to the user's requirements, ending with the specified tokens.

**SUMMARY:**  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a deadly information crisis, where disinformation spreads as rapidly as the virus itself. False claims, such as the virus being caused by 5G or being a hoax, have proliferated online, exacerbating public confusion. Meanwhile, the federal government, particularly under Donald Trump, has repeatedly lied and misled the public, further eroding trust in factual information. These lies, such as false claims about vaccines and treatments, have hindered efforts to protect public health and safety. Disinformation not only misinforms but also undermines the concept of objective truth, creating a cycle of confusion and distrust. At a time when every day counts, the proliferation of falsehoods squanders precious resources and endangers lives. The moral imperative is clear: we must combat disinformation to preserve public consensus and safeguard public health.
