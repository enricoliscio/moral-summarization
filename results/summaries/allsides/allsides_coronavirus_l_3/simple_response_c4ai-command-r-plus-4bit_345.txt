SUMMARY: Disinformation is a unique threat to our stability and society, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the coronavirus spreads globally, misinformation and disinformation about the virus have also exploded online. People are turning to the internet for clarity and reassurance, but instead, they are facing an overwhelming amount of false and misleading information. This disinformation crisis is unlike anything the world has faced before due to the prevalence of technology and the interconnectedness of our world. Dangerous and false claims about the virus, such as it being caused by 5G Wi-Fi or being a bioweapon, are spreading rapidly, and even coming from places of authority like the White House. Donald Trump, for example, has repeatedly lied about the virus, downplaying its severity and spreading misinformation about treatments and vaccines. Disinformation muddies public discussions about safety and exhausts the public's critical thinking. It destroys the concept of objective truth and undermines public consensus, which is crucial during a health crisis. We must hold ourselves responsible for not spreading disinformation and instead focus on educating the public with accurate, factual information to protect public health and safety.
