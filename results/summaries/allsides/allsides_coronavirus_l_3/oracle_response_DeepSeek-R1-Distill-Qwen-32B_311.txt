Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and a list of morally framed words to include. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses how disinformation is spreading alongside the virus, the impact of misinformation on public health, and the role of government mismanagement, particularly mentioning Trump's misleading statements.

Next, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the provided list. Words like "disinformation," "threat," "missteps," "crisis," "dangerous," "lied," "misled," "hinder," etc., are crucial. I should ensure these words are included in the summary.

The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, so I need to be brief but comprehensive. I'll start by highlighting the dual crisis: the pandemic and the disinformation. Then, mention the spread of false claims and their nefarious nature, such as 5G and bioweapon theories.

I should also address the federal response's mismanagement, Trump's lies, and the consequences like public confusion and panic. It's important to note how disinformation destroys trust in objective truth and the need for accurate information.

Finally, I'll conclude by emphasizing the responsibility to combat disinformation to protect public health. I'll make sure to use as many of the provided moral terms as possible without making the summary too lengthy.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise manner, ensuring all key points and moral framing are included.

SUMMARY:  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a dangerous dual crisis: the virus itself and the rampant spread of disinformation. As the coronavirus disrupts global stability, false claims and nefarious theories—such as the virus being caused by 5G or originating as a bioweapon—have proliferated online. These falsehoods, often amplified by social media, threaten public health by misleading individuals and undermining trust in scientific facts. The federal response, marked by mismanagement and the spread of misinformation, has exacerbated the crisis. President Trump's repeated lies, such as falsely claiming chloroquine is an effective treatment or downplaying the virus's severity, have further imperiled public safety. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys belief in objective truth, sowing confusion and panic. At a time when accurate information is critical, the proliferation of falsehoods from online sources and political leaders risks hindering public health efforts. The moral imperative is clear: we must combat disinformation to protect lives and ensure a collective understanding of the virus's dangers. END OF SUMMARY.
