SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a unique threat to global stability, with disinformation spreading rapidly online, posing a significant danger to public health and safety. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus' spread, misinformation and conspiracy theories have exploded, filling the void left by the absence of clear facts and strong leadership. The world is facing a brand-new, dangerous virus that has quickly spread, causing thousands of deaths and millions of job losses. Disinformation, often spread through social media, has the potential to reap serious consequences, especially when it comes from places of authority like the White House. President Trump's repeated lies and misleading statements have imperiled countless lives, muddying public discussions and obscuring the truth. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys public consensus, creating a perpetual cycle of confusion and disillusionment. It's essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, which only hinders public health efforts, and instead, educate the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves.
