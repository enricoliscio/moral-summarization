SUMMARY: 
In the age of COVID-19, disinformation poses an unprecedented threat to stability and has become a critical challenge. As the coronavirus ravages nations, governments are struggling to manage the crisis, with the federal government's response in the U.S. being particularly problematic. This mismanagement has opened the floodgates to a deluge of misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories that are spreading like wildfire online, endangering public safety and hindering efforts to combat the virus. The article highlights how disinformation not only misinforms but also exhausts critical thinking, obliterates truth, and sows uncertainty and disillusionment. It perpetuates ignorance and squanders precious time and resources that could be used to educate the public and save lives. With each passing day, the proliferation of disinformation—whether from online sources or even the President of the United States—imperils countless lives and hinders public health efforts. It is our responsibility to recognize and reject disinformation, holding ourselves accountable for not abetting its harmful proliferation.
