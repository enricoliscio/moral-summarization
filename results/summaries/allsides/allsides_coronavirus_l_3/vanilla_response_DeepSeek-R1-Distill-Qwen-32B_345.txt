Alright, I need to summarize this article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the article talks about how the pandemic has led to a surge in misinformation. People are turning to the internet for information, but a lot of it is false. Examples include garlic as a cure and 5G causing the virus. These claims are dangerous because they mislead people and undermine public health efforts.

Next, the article mentions the role of social media in spreading this misinformation quickly. It's not just random individuals; even the government, specifically Trump, has made misleading statements. These lies can have real consequences, like people not taking the virus seriously or using ineffective treatments.

The summary should highlight how disinformation affects public consensus and trust in objective truth. It's important to note that this isn't just about being skeptical but about the spread of outright lies that harm public health.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the key points without getting bogged down in details. I'll structure it to first mention the problem, then the sources (online and government), and the consequences. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise with each point.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a surge in disinformation, posing a significant threat to public health and stability. As the virus spreads globally, misinformation about its origins, prevention, and treatment has proliferated online, often through social media. Claims such as garlic preventing infection or 5G causing the virus have been debunked, but they continue to circulate, confusing the public. The federal government's mismanagement, including President Trump's misleading statements about the virus's trajectory and treatments, has further fueled confusion. Disinformation not only misinforms but erodes trust in objective truth, making it harder to achieve public consensus on critical health measures. At a time when accurate information is crucial, the spread of falsehoods undermines efforts to protect public health and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
