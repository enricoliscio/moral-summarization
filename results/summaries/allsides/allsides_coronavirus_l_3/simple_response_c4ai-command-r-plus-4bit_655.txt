SUMMARY: Disinformation is a unique threat to our stability and society in the age of COVID-19. As the coronavirus ravages the world, misinformation and disinformation about the virus have exploded online, with people turning to the internet for clarity and reassurance. The spread of disinformation has been accelerated by social media platforms, and it has the potential to reap serious and dangerous consequences. Since the start of the outbreak, Donald Trump has repeatedly lied and misled the public about the coronavirus, hindering the dissemination of accurate information to protect the public. Disinformation muddies public discussions about safety and exhausts critical thinking on a mass level. It destroys the concept of objective truth and public consensus, which is desperately needed during this crisis. We must hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, whether it comes from the web or the president, as it will only hinder public health efforts.
