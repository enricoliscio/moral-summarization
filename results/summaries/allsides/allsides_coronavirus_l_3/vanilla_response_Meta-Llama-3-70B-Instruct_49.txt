SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a parallel outbreak of disinformation and misinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, misinformation spreads rapidly, with false claims about the virus, its causes, and prevention methods. Social media platforms have enabled disinformation to reach a global audience quickly, often with dangerous consequences. Even the White House has contributed to the spread of disinformation, with President Trump repeatedly lying about the virus and its threat to public safety. Disinformation not only misinforms but also exhausts critical thinking, destroys public consensus, and creates doubt and panic, hindering public health efforts. It is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and to rely on fact-based information to protect ourselves and others.
