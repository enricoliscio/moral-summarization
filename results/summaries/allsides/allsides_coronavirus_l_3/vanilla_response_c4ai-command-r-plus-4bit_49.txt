SUMMARY: Disinformation and misinformation about the coronavirus have spread rapidly online since the outbreak began, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. While the world has faced pandemics before, the current technologically advanced landscape has allowed misinformation to spread at an unprecedented speed and scale. False claims about the virus, such as it being caused by 5G Wi-Fi or originating in a laboratory, have circulated widely, alongside conspiracy theories about social distancing measures and vaccine development. This has been exacerbated by the federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and a lack of clear, accurate information from leadership. Donald Trump, in particular, has repeatedly lied about the virus, its treatment, and potential vaccines. The spread of disinformation muddies public discussions about safety measures and hinders efforts to protect public health. It exhausts critical thinking, destroys belief in objective truth, and undermines public consensus at a time when quick, informed action is crucial. We must recognize the harm caused by disinformation and hold ourselves responsible for not contributing to its proliferation, in order to protect public health and safety.
