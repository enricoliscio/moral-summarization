SUMMARY:
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is facing another insidious threat: a deluge of disinformation and misinformation about the virus. As cities lock down and social distancing measures are implemented, people have turned to the internet for information, only to be met with a torrent of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. From claims that garlic or water can prevent infection to outrageous lies that 5G Wi-Fi is the cause of the virus, disinformation is spreading rapidly online, endangering public safety and imperiling lives. The article highlights how disinformation muddies public discussions, exhausts critical thinking, and obliterates truth, sowing seeds of uncertainty and confusion. The behavior of the president, Donald Trump, has been particularly disingenuous and dangerous, as he has repeatedly lied about the virus and its threat to public safety. In a time of global crisis, where every hour counts and lives hang in the balance, it is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not abetting the proliferation of disinformation, whether it comes from the web or the president himself. This article serves as a stark reminder of the harmful consequences of disinformation and the imperative need for accurate, factual information to protect public health and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
