SUMMARY: Disinformation regarding the coronavirus poses a unique threat to our stability and society. As the world grapples with this crisis, misinformation about the virus is spreading rapidly online, leaving a void that is quickly filled by false claims, conspiracy theories, and dangerous disinformation. This disinformation is not just misleading but also has the potential to hinder public health efforts and imperil lives. The public is facing an onslaught of false information, from baseless claims that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or escaped bioweapons to misleading statements from authorities and the White House. These lies and falsehoods muddy public discussions about safety measures and exhaust critical thinking on a mass level. They destroy the concept of objective truth and sow confusion and panic, making it difficult to establish a much-needed public consensus on the facts and dangers of the virus. The proliferation of disinformation, whether online or from positions of power, ultimately hinders our ability to protect public health and safety during this critical time. We must hold ourselves accountable and not abet the spread of disinformation, which only serves to squander precious time and resources that could be better spent educating the public and saving lives.
