SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a unique challenge in the form of disinformation and misinformation spreading online. While the world has dealt with global health crises before, the interconnectedness of the internet age has allowed false information to reach a global audience with just a few clicks. Misinformation about the coronavirus has been rampant, ranging from harmless suggestions about garlic preventing infection to more dangerous claims that 5G Wi-Fi is the cause of the virus. The article also highlights how the federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and Donald Trump's repeated lies and misleading statements have contributed to the spread of disinformation. In a critical time like this, disinformation muddies public discussions about safety and exhausts the public's ability to think critically. It destroys trust in objective truth and creates a cycle of confusion and disillusionment. The proliferation of disinformation hinders public health efforts and creates doubt and panic, emphasizing the need for accurate information and public consensus.
