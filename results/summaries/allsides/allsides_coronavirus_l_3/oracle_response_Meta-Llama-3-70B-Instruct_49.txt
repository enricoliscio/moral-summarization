SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a unique threat to global stability, with disinformation and misinformation spreading rapidly online. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus' spread, a parallel outbreak of false claims and conspiracy theories has emerged. These nefarious claims, including assertions that eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection, are not only false but also dangerous. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void filled by misinformation, which has spread like wildfire online. Even the White House has contributed to the disinformation, with President Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the virus. This disingenuous rhetoric has imperiled countless lives, muddying public discussions and destroying confidence in objective truth. We must hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating these fallacies, and instead educate the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves. Every day and hour count, and lives hang in the balance. We cannot afford to hinder public health efforts with disinformation.

END OF SUMMARY.
