SUMMARY: Disinformation is a unique threat to stability and society in the age of COVID-19. As the coronavirus continues to spread globally, misinformation and disinformation about the virus have also exploded online. People are turning to the internet for clarity and reassurance, but instead, they are faced with a deluge of false and misleading information. The spread of disinformation is not new, but the interconnectedness of the modern world gives it a global audience with just a few clicks. Dangerous and false claims, such as those made by Donald Trump, have the potential to reap serious consequences and hinder public health efforts. Disinformation muddies public discussions, exhausts critical thinking, and obliterates the concept of objective truth. It destroys the institution of public consensus, which is desperately needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic effectively. We must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting the proliferation of disinformation and instead focus on educating the public with accurate, factual information to protect public health and safety.
