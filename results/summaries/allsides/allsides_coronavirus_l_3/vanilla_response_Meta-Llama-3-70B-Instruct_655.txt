SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new threat to society: disinformation. As governments implement measures to slow the spread of the virus, misinformation about the coronavirus has exploded online. People are turning to the internet for clarity and reassurance, but instead, they're finding false claims and conspiracy theories. These range from harmless (e.g., eating garlic prevents infection) to dangerous (e.g., the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi). The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void that misinformation has filled. Social media platforms have enabled disinformation to spread quickly, and even the White House has contributed to the problem. President Trump has repeatedly lied about the coronavirus, downplaying its severity and making false claims about vaccines and treatments. Disinformation is not only misleading but also dangerous, as it muddies public discussions, exhausts critical thinking, and destroys public consensus. It's essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and to rely on facts and evidence to protect public health and safety.
