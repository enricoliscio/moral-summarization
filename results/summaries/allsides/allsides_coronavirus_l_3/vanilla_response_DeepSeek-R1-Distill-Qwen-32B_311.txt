Okay, so I need to summarize this article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by talking about how the pandemic is a big challenge, and along with it, there's a surge in misinformation and disinformation. People are turning to the internet for information, but a lot of what's out there is false. Examples include claims about garlic preventing infection or 5G causing the virus, which are obviously not true. 

The article mentions that this isn't just a new problem because misinformation has always been around, but with the internet and social media, it spreads much faster now. It's dangerous because it can lead people to ignore real health advice or believe in harmful theories. The government's response, especially from Trump, is criticized for spreading lies, like claiming the virus would go away with warmer weather or that chloroquine is a cure, which isn't true. 

The summary needs to capture the main points: the pandemic leading to a surge in misinformation, examples of such claims, the impact of social media on spreading these lies quickly, the role of government misinformation, and the consequences like public confusion and distrust in facts. I should make sure to mention that this isn't just a minor issue but a serious threat to public health and safety. 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Also, the summary should start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should avoid markdown and just use plain text. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the problem, give examples, explain how it spreads, mention the government's role, and conclude with the impact. That should cover all the essential parts concisely.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought a health crisis but also a surge in misinformation and disinformation. As people seek clarity online, false claims about preventive measures, origins, and treatments—such as garlic or 5G causing the virus—have spread rapidly. Social media exacerbates the issue, allowing disinformation to reach millions quickly. The federal government's mismanagement, including false statements from Trump about the virus dissipating with warmer weather or chloroquine as a cure, further undermines public trust. This disinformation threatens public health by sowing confusion, eroding belief in objective truth, and hindering effective public health responses. The situation underscores the critical need for accurate information to combat the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
