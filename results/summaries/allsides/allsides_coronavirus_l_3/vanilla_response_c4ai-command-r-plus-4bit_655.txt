SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a new challenge: the spread of disinformation and misinformation about the virus. While the world has dealt with global health crises before, the current interconnected digital landscape has provided a new platform for false information to reach a global audience quickly and easily. People are turning to the internet for information about the virus, but are often met with misleading or false claims, such as the idea that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or that it is a bioweapon. This disinformation is dangerous as it obscures public discussions about safety measures and exhausts the public's ability to think critically about the issue. It also undermines trust in objective truth and institutions of public consensus, which are crucial for an effective response to the pandemic. Furthermore, disinformation coming from authoritative sources, such as the White House, can be especially harmful as it misleads the public and hinders the dissemination of accurate, life-saving information. It is important to recognize disinformation and not contribute to its spread, as it only serves to hinder public health efforts during this critical time.
