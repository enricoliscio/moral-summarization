Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They want the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of disinformation. It mentions how misinformation is spreading online, leading to confusion and panic. Examples include false claims about garlic preventing infection and 5G causing the virus. 

The article also points out that the federal government's response has been mishandled, which has contributed to the spread of misinformation. It specifically calls out Donald Trump for making false statements about the virus, like it dissipating with warmer weather and approving chloroquine as a treatment. 

The main idea is that disinformation is a significant threat during the pandemic, leading to public distrust and hindering public health efforts. It emphasizes the importance of accurate information and critical thinking.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should focus on the key points: the pandemic, the spread of misinformation, examples of false claims, the government's role, the impact on public trust, and the need for accurate information.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the pandemic, then the rise of misinformation, examples, the government's role, the consequences, and the call for responsibility. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and use clear, concise language.

Let me draft it out:

Start with the pandemic's impact and the misinformation outbreak. Mention the examples of false claims. Then talk about the government's mishandling and Trump's misleading statements. Highlight how this misinformation affects public trust and hinders efforts. End with the need for accurate information and individual responsibility.

I think that covers all the main points without going into too much detail. Now, I'll put it together, ensuring it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the tokens.

SUMMARY:  
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought a global health crisis but also a surge in disinformation and misinformation. As the virus spreads, false claims about its origins, prevention, and treatment—such as garlic or 5G causing the virus—have proliferated online. The federal government's mishandling of the crisis has further fueled confusion, with President Trump making misleading statements about the virus dissipating in warmer weather and approving unproven treatments like chloroquine. Disinformation, often amplified by social media, undermines public trust in science and public health measures, creating a dangerous cycle of confusion and panic. The spread of falsehoods, whether from online sources or political leaders, obscures critical discussions about public safety and erodes belief in objective truth. At a time when accurate information is crucial, disinformation hinders efforts to protect public health and safety, emphasizing the need for responsible sharing of facts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
