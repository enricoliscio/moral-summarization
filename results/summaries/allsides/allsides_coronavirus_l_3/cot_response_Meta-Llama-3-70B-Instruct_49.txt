SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a parallel outbreak of disinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As people turn to the internet for clarity, misinformation and conspiracy theories are spreading rapidly, fueled by social media and even the White House. The lies and misinformation are not only disingenuous but also dangerous, imperiling countless lives and hindering public health efforts. Disinformation exhausts critical thinking, destroys public consensus, and sows uncertainty, leading to confusion and disillusionment. It's essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating these harmful falsehoods, which only create doubt and panic, and instead focus on educating the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves. Every day and hour count, and lives literally hang in the balance.
