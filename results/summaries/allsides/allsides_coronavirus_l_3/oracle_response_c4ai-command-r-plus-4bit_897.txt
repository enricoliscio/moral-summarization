SUMMARY: Disinformation about the coronavirus poses a unique threat to stability and society. While the world has faced pandemics before, the spread of misinformation in the age of the internet is unprecedented. False claims about the virus abound, from those that are relatively harmless, such as eating garlic to prevent infection, to more nefarious theories that it was caused by 5G Wi-Fi or originated as a bioweapon. These lies have real consequences, endangering public health and safety. They exhaust critical thinking and erode trust in objective truth.

The mismanagement of the crisis by the federal government, particularly the repeated lies and misleading statements of Donald Trump, has only worsened the situation. Trump's false claims about the virus, from its dissipation in warm weather to the immediate availability of vaccines, endanger the public. Disinformation, whether concocted online or disseminated by the White House, obscures public discussions about critical safety measures. It sows confusion, doubt, and panic, squandering time and resources that could be used to educate and protect the public. In a time of global crisis, it is imperative to hold those responsible for spreading disinformation accountable and ensure that accurate information reaches the public to hinder the spread of the virus and save lives.
