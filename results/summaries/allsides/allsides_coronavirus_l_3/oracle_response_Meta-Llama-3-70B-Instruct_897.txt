SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a unique threat to global stability, with disinformation and misinformation spreading rapidly online. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus' spread, a parallel outbreak of false claims and conspiracy theories has emerged. These nefarious lies, including claims that 5G Wi-Fi causes the virus or that social distancing is a ploy for martial law, are dangerous and misleading. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void filled by misinformation, which has spread like wildfire online. Donald Trump's repeated lies about the virus have further imperiled public safety, muddying public discussions and exhausting critical thinking. Disinformation destroys trust in objective truth, sowing seeds of uncertainty and perpetuating a cycle of confusion. We must hold ourselves responsible for not spreading disinformation, which only hinders public health efforts and creates more doubt and panic. Every day counts, and we must educate the public on the facts to protect themselves.

END OF SUMMARY.
