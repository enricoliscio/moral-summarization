SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new challenge: disinformation and misinformation. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, false information about the virus is spreading rapidly online. Claims such as eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection, or that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or is a bioweapon, are false and dangerous. The lack of clear facts, data, and strong leadership has created a void filled by misinformation. Social media platforms have enabled disinformation to spread quickly, with serious consequences. Even the White House has contributed to the problem, with President Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the virus. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys public consensus and critical thinking, making it harder to educate the public on facts and ways to protect themselves. It is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and to rely on principled, critical analysis.
