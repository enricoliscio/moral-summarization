Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article. The user specified that I should return the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, the summary should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the spread of disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, how it's affecting public perception and safety, and the role of social media and government misinformation.

I should identify key points: the pandemic's impact, the rise of misinformation, examples of false claims, the role of social media, and the consequences of disinformation, especially from authoritative figures like the White House.

I need to condense these points into a concise summary. I'll focus on the main ideas without getting bogged down in details. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, examples, the spread via social media, and the negative impacts.

I should also mention the role of President Trump's misleading statements and how they contribute to public confusion. The summary should highlight the dangers of disinformation in a time when accurate information is critical.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that it effectively captures the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only brought a health crisis but also a surge in disinformation, posing a significant threat to public stability and safety. As the virus spreads globally, misinformation about preventive measures, origins, and treatments has proliferated online, fueled by social media and a lack of clear leadership. Conspiracy theories, such as claims that the virus is linked to 5G or is a hoax, have gained traction, exacerbating confusion and fear. The federal government's mismanagement, including President Trump's misleading statements about the virus dissipating in warmer weather or approving unproven treatments, has further eroded public trust. Disinformation undermines critical thinking, destroys belief in objective truth, and hinders public health efforts. In a time when accurate information is crucial, the spread of falsehoods risks lives and delays effective responses. The need for public consensus on the facts is urgent, as disinformation only deepens confusion and panic. END OF SUMMARY.
