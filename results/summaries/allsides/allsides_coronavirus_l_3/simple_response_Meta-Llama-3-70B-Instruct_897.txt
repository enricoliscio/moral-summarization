SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a unique threat to global stability and society, with disinformation and misinformation spreading rapidly online. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, false claims about the virus are spreading as fast as the virus itself, including claims that garlic or water can prevent infection, or that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or is a bioweapon. These lies are not only false but also dangerous, as they undermine public safety measures and create confusion and disillusionment. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has also contributed to the spread of misinformation, with Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the coronavirus. Disinformation is a serious threat to public health and safety, exhausting critical thinking and destroying public consensus. It is essential to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and to rely on factual information to educate the public and protect themselves.
