SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a parallel outbreak of disinformation and misinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the virus' spread, people have turned to the internet for clarity, only to be met with a sea of confusion. Nefarious claims, such as 5G Wi-Fi causing the virus, have spread like wildfire online, fueled by social media platforms. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void filled by misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. Even the White House has contributed to the problem, with Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the coronavirus. This disinformation has dangerous consequences, imperiling countless lives and exhausting the public's critical thinking. It's essential that we hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating these falsehoods, which only hinder public health efforts and create more doubt and panic. END OF SUMMARY.
