SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth a parallel outbreak of disinformation and misinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, they are met with a sea of confusion, perpetuating the deadliest information crisis the world has ever faced. Disinformation regarding the coronavirus has exploded online, with claims ranging from garlic and water as preventatives to 5G Wi-Fi and bioweapons as causes. These lies are not only false but also dangerous, as they hinder public understanding and safety. The federal government's mismanagement and Donald Trump's repeated lies have further fueled the spread of disinformation, which can have serious and even deadly consequences. It is crucial that we hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, and instead, educate the public on facts and ways to protect themselves. Every day and hour count, and lives literally hang in the balance.
