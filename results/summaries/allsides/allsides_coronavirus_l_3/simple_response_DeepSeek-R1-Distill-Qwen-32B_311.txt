Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by talking about how disinformation is a unique threat during the pandemic. It mentions that while the virus is spreading, so is misinformation about it. People are turning to the internet for information, but instead, they're getting a lot of false claims. Examples include garlic preventing infection, 5G causing the virus, etc. The author points out that none of these are true and emphasizes that the virus is real and dangerous.

Then the article discusses how the current technological landscape makes the spread of disinformation faster and more widespread. It mentions that while misinformation isn't new, the interconnected world allows it to reach millions quickly. The author also criticizes the federal government's handling, especially Donald Trump's misleading statements, which further confuse the public and hinder effective communication.

The article goes on to explain that disinformation doesn't just misinform; it destroys trust in objective truth and public consensus. This is dangerous because, during a pandemic, accurate information is crucial. The author argues that we need to be cautious about what we believe and not spread falsehoods, whether they come from online sources or government officials.

So, the moral framing here is about the responsibility to combat disinformation, the danger it poses to public health, and the need for truthful leadership. The summary needs to capture these points succinctly, highlighting the spread of misinformation, its consequences, and the call for accountability.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and uses the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified. I'll need to condense the key points without losing the moral emphasis.

Let me structure the summary:

1. Introduce the problem: Disinformation during COVID-19.
2. Examples of misinformation and its spread.
3. The role of technology and government mismanagement.
4. The consequences: undermining public health, destroying trust.
5. The call to action: responsibility to stop spreading lies.

I'll need to keep each point brief but clear, ensuring the moral aspects are highlighted.

Disinformation not only misinforms but destroys belief in objective truth, hindering effective public health responses. At a critical time, accurate information is vital, and the article emphasizes the moral responsibility to combat falsehoods, whether from online sources or leadership, to protect public health and foster trust.
