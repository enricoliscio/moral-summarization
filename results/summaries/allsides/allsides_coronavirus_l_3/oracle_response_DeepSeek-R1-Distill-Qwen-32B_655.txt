Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses how disinformation about COVID-19 is spreading alongside the virus, causing significant threats to public health and stability. It mentions the federal government's mismanagement and the dangerous consequences of misinformation, especially when coming from authoritative sources like the White House.

I should identify key morally framed words: disinformation, threat, missteps, response, crisis, spread, claims, nefarious, caused, originated, used, facing, dangerous, died, absence, filled, mismanagement, rife, consequences, comes, repeatedly, lied, misled, lies, claim, disingenuous, hindrance, inform, protect, imperiling, harm, concocted, coming, muddies, obscures, misinform, push, exhausts, obliterates, destroys, sowing, ensuring, swallowed, confusion, need, dangers, parroting, falsehoods, megaphoned, bankrupt, perpetuate, fallacies, furthering, doubt, panic, squandering, educating, abetting, proliferation, hinder.

Now, I'll craft a concise summary, ensuring to include as many of these words as possible without making it too long. I need to make sure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the negative impacts of disinformation and the failure of leadership.

I'll start by highlighting the dual threat of COVID-19 and disinformation. Then, mention the federal mismanagement and the spread of lies from the White House. I'll include the consequences like public confusion, loss of trust, and the hindrance to public health efforts. Finally, I'll stress the importance of responsible sharing and accurate information.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the essential points and moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds value and maintains the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a deadly information crisis, with disinformation spreading rapidly alongside the virus. Misinformation, often nefarious and misleading, has proliferated online, causing confusion and panic. Claims such as the virus being caused by 5G or being a hoax have been debunked, yet they persist. The federal governmentâ€™s mismanagement has exacerbated the crisis, with the absence of clear leadership allowing disinformation to fill the void. President Trump has repeatedly lied and misled the public, imperiling lives by obliterating trust in facts. Disinformation not only misinforms but destroys public consensus, sowing seeds of uncertainty and eroding belief in objective truth. At a time when every hour counts, the spread of falsehoods and conspiracy theories hinders public health efforts and squanders resources that could educate and protect the public. The moral imperative is clear: we must not abet the proliferation of disinformation, whether from the web or the White House, to safeguard public health and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
