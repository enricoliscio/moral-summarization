Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about how disinformation is a unique threat in the age of COVID-19. It mentions how the pandemic has led to a lot of misinformation spreading online, especially because people are turning to the internet for information. Examples given include claims about garlic preventing infection and conspiracy theories about 5G or the virus being a bioweapon. The author emphasizes that these are false and stresses the real danger of the virus.

Then, the article discusses how the federal response, particularly from Donald Trump, has contributed to the spread of misinformation. Trump is accused of lying and misleading the public, which undermines public safety. The author points out that this misinformation not only misinforms but also erodes trust in objective truth and institutions. They argue that this is especially dangerous because it creates confusion and panic, which hinders effective public health responses.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words, so I need to condense the key points. I should highlight the spread of misinformation, its effects, and the role of leadership, especially Trump. I also need to maintain the moral tone, which criticizes the spread of lies and their impact on public trust and safety.

Let me structure the summary: start with the problem (disinformation during COVID), examples, the role of social media, the federal government's role (Trump's lies), the consequences (eroding trust, public consensus), and the call to action (individual responsibility).

I should make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll need to be concise but cover all the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

I think that's a good plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it captures the moral framing and stays within 200 words.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a dangerous surge in disinformation, exacerbating global confusion and fear. Misinformation, ranging from false claims about preventive measures to conspiracy theories, has spread rapidly online, fueled by social media and a lack of clear leadership. The federal government's mismanagement, particularly under Donald Trump, has further eroded public trust, with Trump repeatedly making false claims about the virus and its treatment. This disinformation not only misleads but also undermines public consensus and critical thinking, creating a cycle of confusion and panic. The article emphasizes the moral imperative to combat disinformation, as it threatens public health and safety, and calls for accountability in curbing its spread. END OF SUMMARY.
