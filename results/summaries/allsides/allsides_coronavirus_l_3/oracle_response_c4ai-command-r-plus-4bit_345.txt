SUMMARY: Disinformation regarding the coronavirus is a unique threat to stability and society. As the virus spreads globally, misinformation about the virus is also spreading online, with false claims about prevention, self-diagnosis, and its nature. This has led to one of the deadliest information crises the world has ever faced, as disinformation can now reach a global audience with just a few clicks. The US federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and Donald Trump's repeated lies and misleading statements about the virus have further contributed to the spread of disinformation. Trump's disingenuous remarks continue to hinder efforts to inform and protect the public, endangering countless lives. Disinformation obscures public discussions about safety, exhausts critical thinking, obliterates truth, and sows seeds of uncertainty and confusion. It undermines the institution of public consensus, which is desperately needed during this crisis. We must not perpetuate fallacies and lies that contribute to public confusion and ignorance about the coronavirus, as they hinder public health efforts.

END OF SUMMARY.
