Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the two main tasks here. The first step is to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user wants me to list these words, each on a new line, prefixed with an asterisk. The second task is to write a concise summary of the article, preserving the moral framing and keeping it under 200 words. The summary should come after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should start by reading through the article carefully to spot any morally charged words. Words like "unique threat," "scorch," "defining global missteps," "challenges," "destabilize," "deadliest information crisis," "nefarious," "outrageous," "hoax," "conspiracy theories," "misleading," "disingenuous," "dangerous hindrance," "imperiling," "obscures," "exhausts," "obliterates," "destroys," "uncertainty," "confusion," "disillusionment," "fallacies," "ignorance," "panic," "squandering," "hinder," and "abetting" stand out as having strong moral connotations.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral terms intact. The summary should highlight the dangers of disinformation, its impact on public health, and the role of both online platforms and government officials in spreading misinformation. It's important to emphasize the consequences of such disinformation, like undermining trust in authorities and exacerbating the pandemic's effects.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the problem of disinformation, moving to its sources and effects, and concluding with the call for responsibility to combat it. Keeping it concise is key, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting bogged down in details.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." while adhering to the word limit. I'll double-check that all the morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a dangerous crisis: the rapid spread of disinformation. As the virus disrupts global stability, false claims about its origins, prevention, and impact have proliferated online, exacerbating fear and confusion. Misinformation, often amplified by social media, threatens public health by undermining trust in science and official guidance. The federal response, marked by misleading statements and false claims from leaders, has further eroded public confidence. Disinformation not only misinforms but also destroys belief in objective truth, creating a cycle of doubt and panic. At a time when accurate information is critical, the proliferation of lies and conspiracy theories risks imperiling lives and hindering public health efforts. The moral imperative is clear: we must combat disinformation to protect public consensus and ensure a shared understanding of the pandemic's risks. END OF SUMMARY.
