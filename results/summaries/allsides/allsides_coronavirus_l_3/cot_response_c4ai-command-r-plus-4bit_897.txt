SUMMARY:
Disinformation about COVID-19 poses a grave threat to stability and public safety. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought nations to their knees, is being exacerbated by an outbreak of misinformation and disinformation. As people seek clarity online amidst lockdowns and social distancing measures, they are instead met with a deluge of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. These range from harmless suggestions about garlic to outrageous claims of 5G involvement or bioweapon origins. While some disinformation may seem benign, it can have dangerous consequences, especially when it comes from authoritative sources like the White House. Since the start of the outbreak, Donald Trump has repeatedly lied about the virus, misleading the public and endangering lives. This disinformation muddies critical discussions about public safety and exhausts the public's ability to think critically. It obliterates truth and destroys confidence in the concept of objectivity. In a time when quick and accurate information is needed to save lives, disinformation only creates more doubt and panic, hindering public health efforts. We must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting the proliferation of disinformation, whether it comes from the internet or the president.
