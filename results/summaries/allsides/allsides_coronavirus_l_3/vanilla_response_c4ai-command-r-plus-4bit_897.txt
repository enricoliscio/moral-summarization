SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a new wave of disinformation and misinformation, threatening global stability and society. With the virus spreading rapidly worldwide, false information about the virus's origins, prevention measures, and cures has proliferated online. Conspiracy theories about 5G Wi-Fi, bioweapons, and social conditioning have also gained traction. This misinformation crisis is unique due to our technologically advanced landscape, allowing disinformation to reach a global audience instantly. The article highlights how the U.S. federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and Donald Trump's repeated lies about the virus have exacerbated the problem. Trump's false claims about the virus dissipating in warmer weather, vaccine production, and treatment approvals have endangered public health and hindered the dissemination of accurate information. The article emphasizes the harm caused by disinformation, which obscures public discussions, exhausts critical thinking, and destroys trust in objective truth. It calls for responsibility in not spreading disinformation, which hinders public health efforts during this critical time.
