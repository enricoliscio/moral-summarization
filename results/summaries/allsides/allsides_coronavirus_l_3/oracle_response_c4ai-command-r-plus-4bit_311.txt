SUMMARY: Disinformation regarding the coronavirus poses a unique threat to stability and society in the age of COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, misinformation and disinformation have quietly festering online, with claims about preventive measures, self-diagnoses, and the nature of the virus. This disinformation crisis is exacerbated by the advanced technological landscape of the 21st century, allowing false information to reach a global audience with a few clicks. Dangerous and nefarious claims, such as the virus being caused by 5G Wi-Fi or being a bioweapon, have spread rapidly. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and lack of clear facts and strong leadership have further contributed to the spread of disinformation. Donald Trump has repeatedly lied and misled the public about the coronavirus, hindering efforts to inform and protect the public. Disinformation muddies public discussions about safety and exhausts critical thinking on a mass level. It obliterates truth and destroys belief in objective facts, sowing seeds of uncertainty and confusion. In a time when public consensus on the facts and dangers of the coronavirus is crucial, disinformation only creates more doubt and panic, hindering public health efforts. We must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting the proliferation of disinformation and instead focus on educating the public with accurate information to protect lives.
