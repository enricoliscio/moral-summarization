SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a parallel outbreak of disinformation and misinformation, posing a unique threat to global stability and society. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, misinformation about the virus has exploded online, spreading as fast as the virus itself. Examples of disinformation include claims that eating garlic or taking sips of water can prevent infection, or that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or is a bioweapon. However, none of this is true, and the coronavirus is a real and dangerous virus that has spread rapidly worldwide. Misinformation and disinformation have serious consequences, especially when coming from places of authority like the White House. Donald Trump's lies and misleading statements have hindered efforts to inform and protect the public, imperiling countless lives. It is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, which only creates doubt and panic, and instead focus on educating the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves.
