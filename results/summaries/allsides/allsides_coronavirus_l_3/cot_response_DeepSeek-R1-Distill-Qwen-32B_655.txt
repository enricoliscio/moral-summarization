Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific steps: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary using those words. 

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "scorch," "missteps," "challenge," "overwhelmed," "halts," "outbreak," "explosive," "clarity," "reassurance," "deadliest," "mismanagement," "conspiracy," "nefarious," "outrageous," "hoax," "curtail," "covert," "escaped," "real," "potential," "dangerous," "hinder," "exhaust," "obliterates," "uncertainty," "confusion," "disillusionment," "fallacies," "panic," "squandering," "abetting," "hinder." 

Now, for the summary, I need to make sure it's under 200 words and includes as many of these moral words as possible. The article talks about how disinformation is a major issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing confusion and undermining public health efforts. It also mentions how misinformation spreads quickly online and how political figures like Trump have contributed to the problem by spreading false information, which has real consequences on public safety and trust.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the threat of disinformation, its spread, the impact of false claims, the role of social media, the lies from Trump, and the importance of accurate information for public health. I'll make sure to use the moral words identified to maintain the framing.

**Summary:**

Disinformation poses a significant threat during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating confusion and undermining public health efforts. As the virus spreads, misinformation has proliferated online, with claims ranging from the absurd, like garlic preventing infection, to more nefarious theories, such as the virus being a bioweapon or linked to 5G. These falsehoods, often amplified by social media, erode public trust and critical thinking, creating a dangerous cycle of uncertainty. The federal government's mismanagement, particularly under Trump's leadership, has further fueled disinformation, with lies about the virus dissipating with warmer weather or the FDA approving unproven treatments. Such deceptions not only hinder public health efforts but also destroy belief in objective truth, sowing seeds of confusion and panic. At a time when accurate information is critical, the proliferation of disinformation endangers lives and undermines collective action against the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
