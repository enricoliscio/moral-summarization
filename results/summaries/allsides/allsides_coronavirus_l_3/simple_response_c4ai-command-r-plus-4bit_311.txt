SUMMARY: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is also facing an outbreak of disinformation and misinformation about the virus. This disinformation ranges from false preventive measures to outrageous claims about the virus's origins and the motives behind social distancing measures. While disinformation and misinformation are nothing new, the interconnectedness of the modern world allows it to reach a global audience with just a few clicks. This disinformation has dangerous consequences, as it muddies public discussions about safety and exhausts the public's critical thinking. It destroys the concept of objective truth and public consensus, which are desperately needed during this crisis. The article highlights how the US federal government, particularly President Donald Trump, has contributed to the spread of disinformation through misleading statements and lies about the virus. This highlights the importance of holding ourselves responsible for not spreading disinformation, whether it comes from the internet or authority figures, to protect public health and safety.
