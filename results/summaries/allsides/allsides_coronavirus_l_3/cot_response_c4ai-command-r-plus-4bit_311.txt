SUMMARY: 
Disinformation regarding the coronavirus poses a serious threat to stability and social order in the age of COVID-19. As the pandemic ravages nations, misinformation about the virus has quietly become another dangerous outbreak in itself. Amid lockdowns and social distancing measures, people have turned to the internet for clarity, only to be met with a sea of confusion and disinformation. Nefarious and outrageous claims, such as the virus being caused by 5G or being a bioweapon, are false and downplay the severity of the situation. This disinformation crisis is a misstep that muddies critical discussions about public safety and obscures the truth. It exhausts critical thinking, destroys belief and confidence in objective truth, and sows uncertainty. In a time of crisis, public consensus is vital, yet disinformation only perpetuates fallacies and lies, squandering precious time and resources that could be used to educate and protect the public. The proliferation of disinformation, whether online or from those in authority, ultimately hinders public health efforts and endangers lives. We must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting this harmful proliferation.
END OF SUMMARY.
