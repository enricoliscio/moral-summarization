Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how disinformation during COVID-19 is a threat, causing confusion and hindering public health efforts. The author mentions misinformation from online sources and the government, especially Trump's misleading statements.

I should start by identifying the key moral concepts: disinformation as a threat, the government's mismanagement, the crisis, the spread of lies, and the consequences like lives lost. I need to use words like "disinformation," "threat," "missteps," "crisis," "spread," "dangerous," "lies," "misled," "hinder," etc.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce disinformation as a threat, then discuss its spread online and from authorities, the impact on public health, and the need for accurate information. I'll make sure each sentence incorporates the moral terms without making it too verbose.

Let me draft a few sentences, checking word count and ensuring all key points are covered. I'll also ensure the tone reflects the moral concern presented in the original article.

SUMMARY:  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a dangerous crisis: the spread of disinformation, which poses a unique threat to public health and stability. As the virus spreads, so does a flood of misinformation, ranging from claims about preventive measures to nefarious theories about the virus's origins and purposes. This disinformation, often amplified by social media, muddies public discourse and undermines trust in objective truth. The federal government's mismanagement has further exacerbated the situation, with leaders like Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public, imperiling lives and hindering efforts to inform and protect the public. Disinformation not only misinforms but destroys public consensus and critical thinking, sowing confusion and disillusionment. At a time when accurate information is critical, the proliferation of lies and falsehoods only fuels panic and doubt, squandering resources that could be used to educate the public. The moral imperative is clear: we must hold ourselves accountable to prevent the spread of disinformation and ensure public health efforts are not hindered by falsehoods.  
END OF SUMMARY.
