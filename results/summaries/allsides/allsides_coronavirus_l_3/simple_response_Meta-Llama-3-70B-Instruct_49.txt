SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a unique threat to global stability and society, with disinformation and misinformation spreading rapidly online. As people turn to the internet for clarity and reassurance, false claims about the virus are spreading just as fast as the virus itself. These claims, including conspiracy theories, are not only false but also dangerous, as they undermine public health efforts and create confusion and panic. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis has created a void that misinformation has filled, and even the White House has contributed to the spread of disinformation. The lies and misinformation have real consequences, imperiling countless lives and hindering public discussions about public safety. It is crucial that we hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation and instead focus on educating the public on the facts and ways to protect themselves. In this critical time, every day and hour count, and lives literally hang in the balance.
