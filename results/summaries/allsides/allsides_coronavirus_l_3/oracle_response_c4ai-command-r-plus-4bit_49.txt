SUMMARY: Disinformation is a unique threat to stability and society in the age of COVID-19. As the coronavirus ravages the globe, misinformation and disinformation about the virus have also spread, creating a deadly information crisis. People have turned to the internet for clarity, but instead find a deluge of false claims, such as the nefarious idea that 5G Wi-Fi is the cause of the virus. This disinformation muddies public discussions about safety measures and exhausts critical thinking on a mass level. It obliterates truth and destroys belief in objective facts, sowing seeds of uncertainty and confusion. Disinformation has serious consequences, especially when it comes from places of authority like the White House. Donald Trump has repeatedly lied about the coronavirus, claiming it will dissipate in warm weather and that a vaccine is imminent. These lies are a dangerous hindrance to public health efforts, imperiling countless lives. We must hold ourselves responsible for not abetting the proliferation of disinformation, whether online or from leaders, to ensure an informed public response to this crisis.
