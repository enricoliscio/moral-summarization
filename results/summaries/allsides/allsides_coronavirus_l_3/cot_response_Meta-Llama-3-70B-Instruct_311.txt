SUMMARY:
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique threat to our stability and society has emerged: disinformation. As governments implement social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus, misinformation regarding the coronavirus has exploded online, spreading as fast as the virus itself. This "deadly information crisis" has led to a wave of misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories that have spread like wildfire online. Even the White House has contributed to this crisis, with Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the coronavirus. This "disingenuous" behavior has imperiled countless lives, exhausting the public's critical thinking and destroying any sense of belief in objective truth. It is crucial that we hold ourselves responsible for not perpetuating disinformation, which only creates more doubt and panic, hindering public health efforts. We must prioritize facts and truth to protect ourselves and others from this "real" and "dangerous" virus. END OF SUMMARY.
