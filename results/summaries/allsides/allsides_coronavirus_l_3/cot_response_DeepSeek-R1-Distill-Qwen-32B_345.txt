Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure to follow, which includes two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll tackle STEP 1. I need to go through the article and pick out all the single words that carry a moral connotation. These are words that imply right, wrong, good, or bad. I'll read through each paragraph and highlight terms that fit. For example, words like "threat," "challenge," "misinformation," "deception," "dangerous," etc., seem to carry moral weight because they suggest negative outcomes or unethical behavior.

Once I've listed all these words, I'll move on to the summary. The summary needs to be under 200 words and include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll make sure to capture the main points of the article: the pandemic's impact, the spread of misinformation, the role of social media, and the harmful effects of false information, especially from authoritative sources like the White House.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the problem of disinformation during COVID-19, then discuss how it spreads and its consequences, and finally touch on the role of leadership in exacerbating the issue. I'll ensure that each sentence includes some of the identified moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I also need to be concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting bogged down in details. It's important to convey the severity and the ethical implications of spreading misinformation, especially in a crisis where accurate information is crucial for public safety.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all the morally framed words are included and that the summary flows logically, preserving the author's original concern about the dangers of disinformation in the pandemic context.

### SUMMARY:  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a dangerous crisis: the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which poses a significant threat to public health and societal stability. As the virus spreads, so does a deluge of false claims, from harmless myths about garlic and water to malicious theories about 5G and bioweapons. These lies, often amplified by social media, undermine public trust and critical thinking, creating confusion and panic. The situation is exacerbated by misleading statements from authoritative figures, such as President Trump, who has repeatedly disseminated falsehoods about the virusâ€™s behavior, treatments, and timeline. Such deceptions not only mislead the public but also erode confidence in objective truth, making it harder to achieve public consensus on critical safety measures. In a time when every day and hour matters, the proliferation of misinformation endangers lives and hinders efforts to combat the pandemic. It is imperative to hold ourselves accountable for not spreading lies, whether they originate online or from the White House. END OF SUMMARY.
