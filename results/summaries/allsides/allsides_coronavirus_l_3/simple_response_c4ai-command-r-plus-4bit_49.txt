SUMMARY: Disinformation and misinformation regarding the coronavirus have exploded online, posing a unique threat to our stability and society. In the midst of the pandemic, people have turned to the internet for clarity and reassurance, but instead have been met with a deluge of false and misleading information. Conspiracy theories and false claims, such as the notion that the virus is caused by 5G Wi-Fi or that it is a bioweapon, have spread rapidly. The federal government's mismanagement of the crisis and lack of strong leadership have only exacerbated the problem, with Donald Trump repeatedly lying and misleading the public about the severity of the threat. Disinformation muddies public discussions about safety, exhausts critical thinking, and obliterates the concept of objective truth. It undermines public consensus and creates doubt and panic, hindering public health efforts. In a time where lives hang in the balance, it is crucial to hold ourselves responsible for not contributing to the spread of disinformation, whether it comes from the internet or the president.
