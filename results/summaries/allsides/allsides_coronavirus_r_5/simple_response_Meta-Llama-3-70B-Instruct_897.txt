SUMMARY:

The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. While staying at home may prevent COVID-19 cases, it also leads to increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and the poor also has serious health implications. With hospital beds and testing available, it's time to reopen the economy prudently. The lockdown has devastating effects, including a 1,000% increase in mental health hotline texts, 86-94% decrease in cancer screenings, and 75,000 potential deaths from drug abuse and suicide. The economic devastation could kill more people than the virus itself, with 130 million people at risk of starvation by the end of 2020. It's time to ease up restrictions and make responsible decisions based on scientific data, with sympathy and respect for the working class who have everything at stake.

END OF SUMMARY.
