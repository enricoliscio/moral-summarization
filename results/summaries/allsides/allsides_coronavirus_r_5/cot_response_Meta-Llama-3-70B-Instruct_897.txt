SUMMARY:
The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. The devastating consequences of keeping the economy shut down include a spike in suicide rates, delayed cardiac procedures, and a decline in cancer screenings. The widening economic disparity between the rich and poor also has its own health implications. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, we now have the resources to mitigate them. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, making responsible decisions based on scientific data. Many areas of the country are safe to reopen, and Americans deserve the choice to take calculated risks safely and responsibly. Instead of judgment from the ruling class, there should be sympathy and respect for workers who have everything at stake, from their personal health to their economic livelihoods. END OF SUMMARY.
