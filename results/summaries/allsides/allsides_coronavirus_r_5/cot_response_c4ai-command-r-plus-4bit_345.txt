SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is not just an economic issue, but a health issue as well. The lockdown has serious health consequences: suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and routine vaccinations are declining, and economic inequality is widening, all of which have devastating health implications. While there are risks associated with reopening, we now have the resources to mitigate these risks and manage the virus prudently. State and local officials must make responsible decisions based on scientific data and recognize that there are wide swathes of the country that are now safe to reopen. The lockdown is disproportionately affecting the working class, who have everything at stake â€“ from their personal health to their economic livelihoods. Americans are simply asking for the choice to take that risk safely and responsibly, without judgment from the ruling class. Instead, they deserve sympathy and respect as they continue to put food on their table and support their families during this pandemic.
