SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-vs-economy issue, but also a health-vs-health issue. The prolonged shutdown is causing serious health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and poor is also having health implications. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, the article suggests that with available hospital beds and testing, these risks can be mitigated. The goal of "flattening the curve" was to ensure localities had resources, which they now do. The article cites statistics showing the devastating effects of the lockdown on mental health, cancer diagnoses, and economic inequality. It concludes that it's time to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently, allowing responsible reopening decisions based on scientific data.
