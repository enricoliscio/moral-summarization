SUMMARY: Kelly Sadler, communications director for America First Policies, argues that the US must reopen its economy despite the risks of the coronavirus pandemic. Sadler highlights the negative health impacts of the lockdown, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and a rise in domestic violence. Additionally, economic inequality has worsened, which has its own health implications. Sadler cites statistics showing the devastating effects of the lockdown on mental health, cancer screenings, and economic inequality. She also notes that many counties in the US have not had any coronavirus deaths, indicating that it is safe to reopen in those areas. While acknowledging the risks of reopening, Sadler emphasizes that Americans should have the choice to take those risks safely and responsibly. She calls for state and local officials to make data-driven decisions about reopening and expresses sympathy for working-class Americans who have the most at stake in this crisis.
