Okay, so I'm trying to help the user with this query. They provided a news article and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The user also wants me to first identify all the morally framed words. 

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, often indicating approval or disapproval. They can influence the reader's judgment about the issue. 

Looking at the article, the author is arguing against prolonged lockdowns, emphasizing the negative health impacts beyond just the virus. I should scan through the text and pick out words that have strong moral implications. Words like "devastate," "suffering," "exploit," "sacrifice," etc., seem to carry that weight.

Next, I need to summarize the article in a way that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and highlight the main points: the health consequences of lockdowns, economic disparities, and the call to reopen the economy responsibly.

I also need to structure my response with two parts: first, listing the morally framed words, each on a new line starting with an asterisk. Then, providing the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token, making sure it's within the word limit and captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral tone.

I should double-check that I've identified all the relevant words and that the summary accurately reflects the author's perspective without adding my own bias. It's important to stay objective but include the moral framing as the user requested.

Finally, I'll make sure the formatting is correct, with the words listed under STEP 1 and the summary properly tokenized. This way, the user gets exactly what they need in a clear and organized manner.

### SUMMARY:
The article argues that the prolonged lockdown due to COVID-19 is causing significant health and economic harm, framing it as a "health-versus-health" issue. The lockdown has led to spikes in suicide rates, mental health crises, delayed medical treatments, and missed cancer screenings. Additionally, it has exacerbated economic inequality, disproportionately affecting low-income workers and risking long-term health outcomes. The author emphasizes that the U.S. now has the resources to manage reopening safely, such as hospital beds and testing, and criticizes the shift in goals from flattening the curve to indefinite lockdowns. Many counties remain unaffected by the virus, making reopening feasible in those areas. The article calls for empathy and respect for workers who face both health and economic risks, urging a responsible and data-driven approach to reopening. END OF SUMMARY.
