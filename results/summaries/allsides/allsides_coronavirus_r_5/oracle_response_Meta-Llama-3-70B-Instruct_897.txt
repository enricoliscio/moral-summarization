SUMMARY: The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue, with severe consequences such as spiking suicide rates, declining cancer screenings, and missed vaccinations. The goal of "flattening the curve" was to ensure localities had hospital beds and testing, which are now available, making it time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. The lockdown has devastating effects on the economy, particularly on low-income workers, with nearly 40% of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less losing work. This economic devastation can lead to worse health outcomes, including increased infant mortality and obesity. It's time to make responsible decisions on reopening based on scientific data, with sympathy and respect for the working class who have everything at stake. The author argues that we must reopen the economy, not to devastate our nation's health, but to mitigate the risks and support the average Americans who simply want the choice to take that risk safely and responsibly.
