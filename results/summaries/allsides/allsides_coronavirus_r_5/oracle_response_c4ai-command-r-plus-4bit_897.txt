SUMMARY: We must reopen the economy, as the lockdown has serious health consequences beyond COVID-19. Suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and treatments are being missed, and vaccination efforts have nearly ground to a halt. The economic disparity between the rich and poor is widening, which also has health implications. While there are risks to reopening, we now have the resources to mitigate them. The original goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, but the goalposts have shifted to "stay-at-home until we find a cure," which is devastating our nation's health and economy. Since the lockdown, there has been a significant increase in mental health issues, substance abuse, domestic violence, and projected deaths from cancer and suicide. The economic impact is also disproportionately affecting low-income workers, pushing millions to the brink of starvation and worsening health outcomes due to greater inequality. It's time to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently, allowing Americans the choice to take calculated risks to support their families. We must respect and sympathize with the workers who have everything at stake.
END OF SUMMARY.
