SUMMARY:
The coronavirus lockdown is often framed as a trade-off between health and the economy. However, it is important to recognize that keeping the American economy shut down also has serious health consequences. Suicide rates have spiked, and access to healthcare services such as cardiac procedures, cancer screenings, and childhood vaccinations has declined. Economic inequality has widened, which has its own health implications. The lockdown has disproportionately affected low-income workers, and the resulting economic devastation could ultimately kill more people than the virus itself. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, many parts of the country are now safe to reopen. Hospital beds and testing are available to mitigate these risks, and it is important to recognize that the lockdown has also impacted the health and economic livelihoods of average Americans. Instead of judgment, there should be sympathy and respect for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the pandemic.
