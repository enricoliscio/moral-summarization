SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a moral imperative, not just an economic necessity. The lockdown has severe health consequences beyond COVID-19, including increased suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, rising substance abuse, and domestic violence. Economic inequality, exacerbated by the pandemic, also has dire health implications, with the ultra-poor facing starvation and increased mortality. The lockdown disproportionately affects the working class, who are being denied the choice to take calculated risks to support themselves and their families. State and local officials must use scientific data to ease restrictions responsibly, especially in areas with few or no coronavirus cases. The goal should be to manage the virus while protecting the health and livelihoods of all Americans. We must balance the risks and reopen the economy to safeguard the well-being of our nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
