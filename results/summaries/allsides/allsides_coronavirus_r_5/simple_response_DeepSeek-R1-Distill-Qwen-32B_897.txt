Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving its moral framing. The article argues that the lockdown isn't just about health vs. economy but also health vs. health. It lists various negative health impacts like increased suicides, delayed cancer screenings, domestic violence, and economic disparities leading to more deaths than the virus itself. The author points out that many areas have low COVID cases and should reopen. They criticize the ruling class for not understanding the struggles of average workers. I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, keeping the moral points about health consequences and the unfair impact on the working class. I should mention the statistics and the call for prudent reopening based on data. Also, highlight the disparity in job losses and the moral stance against judgment towards workers. Make sure to end with the author's conclusion about respecting workers' choices.

SUMMARY: The article argues that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused significant health and economic consequences, framing the issue as "health versus health" rather than "health versus economy." It highlights rising suicide rates, delayed medical procedures, missed cancer screenings, and increased domestic violence, all linked to the lockdown. Economic disparities have worsened, with low-income workers disproportionately affected, and studies suggest that economic inequality can lead to worse health outcomes. The author notes that while there are risks in reopening, many areas have the resources to manage them safely. They criticize the "stay-at-home until a cure" approach, emphasizing that it would harm both the economy and public health. The article calls for a prudent, data-driven reopening, respecting workers' need to earn a living while acknowledging the risks involved. It argues against judgment from the ruling class and for empathy toward those with the most at stake. END OF SUMMARY.
