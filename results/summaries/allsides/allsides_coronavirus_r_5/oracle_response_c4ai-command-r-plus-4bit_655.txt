SUMMARY: We must face the consequences and reopen the economy, as the lockdown is causing serious health issues beyond COVID-19. Suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and treatments are being missed or delayed, and childhood vaccinations have nearly ground to a halt. Economic inequality is widening, which will lead to worse health outcomes and even deaths. There are risks in reopening, but we now have the resources to mitigate them. The goal was to flatten the curve, not stay locked down until a cure is found, which could devastate our nation's health and economy. State and local officials should ease restrictions and manage the virus based on scientific data. There are wide swathes of the country that are safe to reopen, and Americans should have the choice to take the risk and get back to work to support their families. We should show sympathy and respect for these workers, who have their personal health and economic livelihoods at stake. It's time to reopen and give Americans the choice to take controlled risks.
END OF SUMMARY.
