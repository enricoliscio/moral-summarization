Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author is arguing against prolonged lockdowns, emphasizing health consequences beyond just COVID-19. I should highlight the points about mental health, missed medical screenings, economic disparities, and the impact on vulnerable populations. Also, the argument that reopening is necessary and possible with proper measures. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the moral perspective presented.

SUMMARY: The article argues against prolonged lockdowns, emphasizing that the economic shutdown has severe health consequences beyond COVID-19. Increased suicide rates, delayed medical screenings, and missed vaccinations are highlighted, alongside rising economic inequality. The author notes that while reopening carries risks, resources like hospital beds and testing are now available to manage them. They criticize the shift from "flatten the curve" to indefinite lockdowns, which they argue harm both the economy and public health. Statistics show spikes in mental health issues, cancer delays, domestic violence, and substance abuse deaths linked to lockdowns. The article also points out that low-income workers are disproportionately affected, with economic inequality worsening health outcomes. The author calls for a cautious reopening based on scientific data, respecting workers' need to earn a living while managing risks responsibly. END OF SUMMARY.
