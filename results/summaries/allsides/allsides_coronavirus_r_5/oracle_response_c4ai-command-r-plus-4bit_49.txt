SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a health-versus-health issue. Keeping the American economy shut down has serious health consequences: suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and cardiac procedures are declining, and children are missing their routine vaccinations. Economic inequality also has health implications. Reopening the economy carries risks, but we now have the resources to mitigate them. The goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and it's time to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently. There are wide variations in coronavirus cases and deaths across counties, and state and local officials need to make data-driven decisions on reopening. The lockdown has already devastated the economy and the health of Americans, with increased substance abuse, domestic violence, and missed cancer diagnoses. The economic inequality caused by the pandemic could kill more people than the virus itself, pushing millions to the brink of starvation. It's time to give Americans the choice to take calculated risks and reopen safely and responsibly, with sympathy and respect for those who have everything at stake.
END OF SUMMARY.
