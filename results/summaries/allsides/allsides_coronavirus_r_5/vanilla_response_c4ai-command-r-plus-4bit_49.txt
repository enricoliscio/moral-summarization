SUMMARY: America First Policies communications director Kelly Sadler argues for the reopening of the American economy, citing the negative health impacts of prolonged lockdown. She highlights the rise in mental health issues, missed cancer screenings, potential rise in suicide and drug abuse deaths, and the decline in routine vaccinations for children. Economic inequality is also worsening, which has its own health implications. Sadler points out that the initial goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and that continuing the lockdown until a cure is found will have devastating consequences for the nation's health and economy. She calls for a balanced approach to managing the virus, with state and local officials making data-driven decisions on how and when to reopen. Sadler emphasizes the disproportionate impact on low-income workers and the widening economic inequality, which is linked to worse health outcomes. She concludes that Americans understand the risks and are asking for the choice to take those risks responsibly, and that sympathy and respect are needed instead of judgment from the ruling class.
