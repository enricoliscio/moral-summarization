SUMMARY:

The coronavirus lockdown has devastating consequences on the health and economy of Americans, particularly the poor and working class. The author argues that it's time to reopen the economy, as the lockdown is causing more harm than good. The health consequences of keeping the economy shut down include spiking suicide rates, declining cancer screenings, and missed vaccinations. The economic devastation is also severe, with the ultra-poor being disproportionately affected, leading to predictions of increased starvation and death. The author calls for responsible decisions to be made by state and local officials to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently. It's time to put the working class first and respect their choice to take risks safely and responsibly, rather than judging them from a privileged position. The goal should be to mitigate the risks of reopening, not to devastate the economy and nation's health further.

END OF SUMMARY.
