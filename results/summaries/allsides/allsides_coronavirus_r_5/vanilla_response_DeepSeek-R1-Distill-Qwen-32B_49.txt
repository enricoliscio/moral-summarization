Okay, so I need to summarize this article about reopening the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article argues that the lockdown isn't just about health versus the economy, but also health versus health. It mentions various negative health impacts from the lockdown, like increased suicides, delayed medical procedures, and lower cancer screenings. Also, it points out the economic disparities and how the poor are affected more. The author uses statistics from organizations like SAMHSA and the UN to support the points. They also talk about how some areas have low COVID cases and could reopen safely. The main argument is that the economy needs to reopen to prevent worse health outcomes and economic suffering, and that people should have the choice to work safely. I need to make sure the summary includes all these key points concisely, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main argument, then list the health and economic consequences, mention the statistics, and conclude with the call to reopen based on data. I should avoid getting too detailed on each point to keep it within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step to ensure I cover everything without going over.
