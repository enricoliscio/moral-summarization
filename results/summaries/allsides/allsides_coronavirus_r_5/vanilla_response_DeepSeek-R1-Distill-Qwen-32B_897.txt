Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article argues against the prolonged lockdown, stating it's not just about health vs. economy but health vs. health. It mentions increased suicides, mental health issues, delayed medical treatments, and economic disparities affecting health. The author also points out that some areas have low COVID cases and could reopen safely. They criticize the approach taken by political elites and media, suggesting a more targeted reopening based on data. The summary needs to capture these key points concisely, under 200 words.

I'll start by identifying the main arguments: health consequences of lockdown, economic impact on health, and the potential for selective reopening. I'll also note the author's stance against a one-size-fits-all approach and the call for empathy towards workers.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll ensure it flows logically, starting with the health impacts, moving to economic disparities, and concluding with the need for targeted reopening and support for workers.

SUMMARY: The article argues against prolonged coronavirus lockdowns, emphasizing that the shutdown is not just a health vs. economy issue but also a health vs. health problem. Lockdowns have led to increased suicides, mental health crises, delayed medical treatments, and economic disparities, all of which negatively impact health. The author highlights statistics showing sharp declines in cancer screenings, missed diagnoses, and a surge in domestic violence and substance abuse. They argue that reopening the economy is necessary, as many areas have low COVID-19 cases and could safely resume activity. The article criticizes the "one-size-fits-all" approach to lockdowns, suggesting a data-driven, localized strategy. It also calls for empathy and support for workers who face both health and economic risks, stating that the decision to reopen should balance safety with the need to protect livelihoods. END OF SUMMARY.
