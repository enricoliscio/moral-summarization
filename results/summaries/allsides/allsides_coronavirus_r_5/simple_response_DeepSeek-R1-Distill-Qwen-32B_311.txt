Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author presented. The article argues that reopening the economy is necessary because the lockdown has serious health consequences beyond just the pandemic. The author mentions things like increased suicides, mental health issues, delayed medical treatments, and economic disparities leading to worse health outcomes. They also point out that many areas have low COVID-19 cases and deaths, making it safe to reopen. The author criticizes the ruling class for not understanding the struggles of average workers who can't work from home. 

I should start by identifying the main points: the lockdown's health impacts, economic disparities, the argument for reopening based on scientific data, and the call for empathy towards workers. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective that reopening is a health issue too and that there's a moral obligation to consider those most affected by the lockdown. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points. I'll structure it by first stating the main argument, then listing the health and economic consequences, mention the regional data supporting reopening, and conclude with the call for empathy towards workers. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the author's framing.
