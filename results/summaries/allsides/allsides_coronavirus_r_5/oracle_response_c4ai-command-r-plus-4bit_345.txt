SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a health issue, not just an economic one. Keeping the American economy shut down has serious health consequences: suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and routine vaccinations are declining, and economic disparity is widening, which also affects health outcomes. Reopening the economy carries risks, but we now have the resources to mitigate them. The goal should be to manage the virus prudently and make decisions based on scientific data. There are wide variations in coronavirus cases and deaths across counties, so a one-size-fits-all approach to restrictions is not appropriate. State and local officials should ease up restrictions responsibly, as the lockdown is disproportionately affecting the working class and low-income workers. Americans are asking for the choice to take calculated risks to support their families. Instead of judgment, they deserve sympathy and respect.
END OF SUMMARY.
