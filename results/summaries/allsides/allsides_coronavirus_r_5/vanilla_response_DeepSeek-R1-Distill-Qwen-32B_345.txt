Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is arguing that the lockdown isn't just about health vs. the economy, but also health vs. health. It mentions various negative health impacts like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and domestic abuse. There's also a focus on economic disparities and how the poor are affected more. The author suggests that we have the resources now to reopen safely and that some areas are safe to do so. They criticize the "one-size-fits-all" approach and argue that workers should have the choice to return to work. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points: health consequences of lockdown, economic impact, the argument for reopening, and the call for a responsible approach. I should make sure to highlight the statistics and the main arguments without getting too detailed. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me structure this step by step, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article argues that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused significant health and economic consequences, beyond just the virus itself. It highlights rising suicide rates, delayed medical treatments, and missed cancer screenings, as well as the widening economic disparity between the rich and poor.

They criticize the prolonged lockdown, which they say is causing more harm than good, citing statistics on mental health crises, domestic violence, and missed vaccinations.

The piece concludes by advocating for empathy and respect for those who must work to support their families during the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
