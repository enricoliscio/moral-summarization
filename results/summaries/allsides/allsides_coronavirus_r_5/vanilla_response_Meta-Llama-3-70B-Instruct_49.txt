SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but also a health-versus-health issue. The prolonged shutdown is causing serious health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. Moreover, the economic disparity between the rich and poor is widening, which has its own health implications. The author suggests that it's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, as hospital beds and testing are now available to mitigate risks. The article cites statistics showing the devastating effects of the lockdown on mental health, cancer diagnoses, and childhood vaccinations. It also highlights the disproportionate impact on low-income workers and the ultra-poor, who are at risk of starvation and death. The author concludes that state and local officials must make responsible decisions on reopening based on scientific data, and that Americans should be allowed to take calculated risks to support their families.
