Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article argues that reopening the economy is necessary because the lockdown has severe health consequences beyond just COVID-19. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the lockdown affects mental health, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and economic disparities. These issues have their own health risks. The author also mentions that many areas are safe to reopen based on data, and workers are suffering economically. 

I need to highlight the moral argument that both health and the economy are important and that the lockdown is causing harm. I should mention the statistics provided, like the increase in mental health issues and missed cancer screenings. 

Also, the article points out the unequal impact on low-income workers and how this economic downturn could lead to more deaths than the virus itself. The author emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, using scientific data to reopen safely. 

I'll make sure to include that reopening is necessary to prevent further health and economic damage, while acknowledging the risks but noting that precautions are in place. The moral angle is that the government should prioritize the well-being of all citizens, not just focus on one aspect. 

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the key statistics and the argument for reopening. I'll structure it to first state the main argument, then provide supporting points with the statistics, and conclude with the call for a responsible reopening based on data.
