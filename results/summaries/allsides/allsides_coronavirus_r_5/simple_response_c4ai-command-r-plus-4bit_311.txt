SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a moral imperative, not just an economic necessity. The lockdown has severe health consequences beyond COVID-19, including a rise in suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, and increased domestic violence. Economic inequality has dire health implications, as evidenced by the impact of the pandemic on the ultra-poor and low-income workers. State and local officials should make data-driven decisions to reopen safely and responsibly, especially in areas with few or no coronavirus deaths. The risks of keeping the economy shut down outweigh the risks of reopening, and Americans deserve the choice to take calculated risks to provide for themselves and their families. We must balance the health risks of COVID-19 with the health risks of a locked-down economy, respecting the needs and sacrifices of working-class Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
