SUMMARY: The coronavirus lockdown is being framed as a health versus economy issue, but it's important to recognize that keeping the economy shut down has serious health consequences as well. Suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, childhood vaccinations, and economic disparity are all factors that contribute to negative health outcomes. Reopening the economy carries risks, but with proper precautions and based on scientific data, it is possible to mitigate these risks while also addressing the health and economic needs of the population. There are already devastating statistics showing the impact of the lockdown on mental health, cancer detection, substance abuse, domestic violence, and childhood vaccinations. Additionally, economic inequality has been linked to worse health outcomes, and the pandemic has disproportionately affected low-income workers. State and local officials should make informed decisions about reopening, considering that many counties have not reported any coronavirus deaths and the majority of cases are concentrated in a small percentage of counties. The choice to reopen should be made with empathy and respect for the workers who are risking their health and livelihoods to support their families.
