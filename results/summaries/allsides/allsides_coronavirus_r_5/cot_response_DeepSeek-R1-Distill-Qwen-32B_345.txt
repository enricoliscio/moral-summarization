Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's arguing against the lockdown, saying it's not just a health vs. economy issue, but health vs. health. They mention things like increased suicides, delayed medical procedures, and economic disparities. They also talk about how the lockdown is causing more harm than good, with statistics on mental health, cancer screenings, domestic violence, etc. The author criticizes the ruling class for making decisions that affect the working class more.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to pick out the morally charged words. Words like "devastate," "suffering," "increasing," "crisis," "equitable," "fair," "sacrifice," "prioritize," "proactive," "compassion," "sympathy," "respect," "risk," "choice," "privilege," "equitable," "fair," "sacrifice," "prioritize," "proactive," "compassion," "sympathy," "respect," "risk," "choice," "privilege." I think these words carry moral weight because they express value judgments or emotional appeals.

Next, the summary. I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral words. I'll start by stating that the lockdown is a health vs. health issue, not just economy vs. health. Then mention the negative health impacts like suicides, delayed treatments, economic disparities. Include the statistics about the increase in mental health issues, missed cancer screenings, etc. Then talk about the economic impact, especially on low-income workers, and the call for equitable reopening based on data. End with the need for compassion and respect for workers' choices.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to make sure it's concise. Also, I should maintain the original's tone, which is critical of the lockdown's continuation and supportive of reopening with caution.

Alright, I think I've got the main points. Now, let me put it all together, making sure to include the moral words and keep the summary clear and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue but a health-versus-health crisis. Keeping the economy shut down has led to devastating consequences, including rising suicide rates, delayed medical treatments, and missed cancer screenings. Economic disparity has widened, pushing millions to the brink of starvation and increasing mortality rates, particularly among low-income workers. The author emphasizes that while reopening carries risks, it is essential to prioritize public health and economic well-being. Many areas are safe to reopen, and decisions should be made responsibly based on scientific data. Workers deserve compassion, sympathy, and respect as they face the choice of balancing personal health with economic livelihood. The ruling class, who often have the privilege of working from home, should not judge but instead support those most affected. Reopening must be done equitably, ensuring that the sacrifices made by the working class are fairly addressed.
