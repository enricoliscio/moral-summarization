SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but also a health-versus-health issue. The lockdown has led to serious health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cardiac procedures and cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and poor has also worsened, with low-income workers being disproportionately affected. The article cites statistics showing the devastating impact of the lockdown on mental health, cancer diagnoses, and domestic violence. It also notes that the economic devastation could ultimately kill more people than the virus itself. The author argues that it's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, with state and local officials making responsible decisions based on scientific data. The article concludes that Americans should be given the choice to take risks safely and responsibly, rather than being judged by the ruling class.
