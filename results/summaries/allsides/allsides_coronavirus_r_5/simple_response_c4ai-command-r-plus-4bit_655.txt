SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a moral imperative â€” it's not just about money, but also about health and saving lives. The lockdown has devastating consequences for mental and physical health, as well as widening economic inequality which has its own health implications. Suicide rates are up, cancer screenings and childhood vaccinations are down, and domestic violence is on the rise. Economic inequality is linked to worse health outcomes, and the lockdown is disproportionately affecting low-income workers. We must balance the risks of COVID-19 with the health consequences of keeping the economy shut down. Hospital beds and testing are now available to mitigate the risks of reopening, and many areas of the country have not been severely affected by the virus. The choice to reopen should be left to state and local officials based on scientific data, and Americans should have the choice to take calculated risks to support their families. We must respect the working class and understand that they have everything to lose if the economy remains shut down. END OF SUMMARY.
