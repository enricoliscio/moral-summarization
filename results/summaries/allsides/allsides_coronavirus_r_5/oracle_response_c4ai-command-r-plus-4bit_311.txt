SUMMARY: Reopening the economy is a health issue, and we must mitigate the serious health consequences of keeping it shut. Suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings and childhood vaccinations are declining, and economic disparity is widening, all of which have devastating health implications. While there are risks to reopening, we now have the hospital beds and testing to manage these risks safely and responsibly. State and local officials need to ease restrictions and make decisions based on scientific data, as there are wide swathes of the country that are safe to reopen. The lockdown is disproportionately affecting low-income workers and could lead to worsening health outcomes and increased inequality. Americans understand the risks and are simply asking for the choice to take those risks and support their families. Instead of judgment, workers deserve sympathy and respect for putting their health and livelihoods on the line. The consequences of staying shut are devastating and could result in unnecessary deaths, whether from missed cancer diagnoses, suicide, starvation, or other economic impacts. It's time to reopen and give Americans back their livelihoods.
END OF SUMMARY.
