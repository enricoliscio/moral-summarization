SUMMARY: The COVID-19 lockdown in the United States has serious health consequences beyond the virus itself. Suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, childhood vaccinations, and economic inequality have all been negatively impacted by the lockdown. The lockdown has also led to a rise in domestic violence and substance abuse. These issues highlight that the lockdown is not just an economic issue but also a health issue. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, many parts of the country have the resources to do so safely, such as hospital beds and testing capacity. State and local officials should make data-driven decisions about reopening, as the impact of the virus varies across the country. The lockdown has disproportionately affected low-income workers, and the economic devastation could ultimately kill more people than the virus itself. It is time to ease restrictions and manage the virus while also considering the health and economic needs of Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
