SUMMARY:
The coronavirus lockdown has been framed as a health versus economy debate, but it is important to recognize that there are serious health consequences to keeping the economy shut down as well. Suicide rates have spiked, cancer screenings have declined, and children are missing their routine vaccinations. Economic inequality has widened, which has its own health implications. There are risks to reopening the economy, but we now have the hospital beds and testing capacity to mitigate these risks. The goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and it is time to prudently manage the virus and safely reopen the country. Since the lockdown began, there has been a significant increase in mental health issues, substance abuse, domestic violence, and economic hardship. The lockdown has disproportionately affected low-income workers, and the economic devastation could ultimately kill more people than the virus. State and local officials need to make data-driven decisions about reopening, as there are wide variations in coronavirus cases and deaths across counties. Reopening the economy is a moral imperative, as it gives Americans the choice to take calculated risks to support their personal health and economic livelihoods. We must balance the risks and rewards and show sympathy and respect for those who are most vulnerable during this challenging time.
