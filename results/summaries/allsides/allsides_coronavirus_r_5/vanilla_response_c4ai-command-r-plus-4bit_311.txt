SUMMARY: America First Policies communications director Kelly Sadler argues that the United States must reopen its economy, citing the negative health and economic consequences of prolonged lockdown measures. Sadler highlights the impact of the lockdown on mental health, cancer screenings, vaccination rates, and economic inequality, all of which have indirect health implications. She points out that the initial goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and that many counties in the US have not reported any coronavirus deaths. Sadler calls for a balanced approach to reopening, with state and local officials making data-driven decisions while recognizing the risks and challenges faced by the working class. She emphasizes the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on low-income communities and the potential for greater economic inequality to worsen health outcomes. Sadler concludes that a safe and responsible reopening is necessary to address the multifaceted health crisis and to support the livelihoods of Americans.
