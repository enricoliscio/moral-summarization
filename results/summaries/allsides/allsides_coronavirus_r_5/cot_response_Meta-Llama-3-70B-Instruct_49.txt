SUMMARY:
The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. The consequences of keeping the economy shut down are severe, with rising suicide rates, delayed cardiac procedures, and declining cancer screenings. The widening economic disparity between the rich and poor has its own health implications. While there are risks associated with reopening, we now have the resources to mitigate them. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. State and local officials must make responsible decisions on how and when to reopen based on scientific data. The working class, who have everything at stake, deserve sympathy and respect, not judgment from the ruling class. They should be given the choice to take risks safely and responsibly. It's time to reopen the economy and put America First. END OF SUMMARY.
