SUMMARY: The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue, with serious consequences of keeping the economy shut down, including spiking suicide rates, declining cancer screenings, and devastating economic disparity. The goal of "flattening the curve" was to ensure localities had hospital beds and testing available, which we now have, making it time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. The lockdown has led to a 1,000% increase in mental health hotline texts, 86-94% decrease in cancer screenings, and a projected 80,000 missed or delayed cancer diagnoses. Moreover, the economic devastation could kill more people than the virus itself, with 130 million people predicted to be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. It's time to respect the working class's choice to take the risk of reopening safely and responsibly, rather than judging them from a privileged position. We must reopen the economy to mitigate the devastating consequences of the lockdown. END OF SUMMARY.
