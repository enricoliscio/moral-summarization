SUMMARY:

The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. The consequences of keeping the economy shut down are severe, with spiking suicide rates, declining cancer screenings, and missed vaccinations. The economic devastation disproportionately affects low-income workers, who are at risk of dying from starvation and other health outcomes. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, making responsible decisions based on scientific data. Many areas of the country are safe to reopen, and Americans understand the risks involved, but want the choice to take that risk safely and responsibly. Instead of judgment from the ruling class, there should be sympathy and respect for workers who have everything at stake, from their personal health to their economic livelihoods. It's time to put America First and prioritize the health and well-being of all citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
