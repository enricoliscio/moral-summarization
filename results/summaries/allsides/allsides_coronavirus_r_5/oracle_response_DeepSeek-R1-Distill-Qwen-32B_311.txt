Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author is arguing against the lockdown, saying it's not just about health vs. economy, but health vs. health. They mention various negative health impacts from the lockdown, like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and economic disparities leading to more deaths. They also talk about the economy and how it's affecting people's livelihoods, especially the poor. The author uses words like'reopen', 'consequences', 'devastate', etc., so I need to include those. I should structure the summary to highlight the health consequences of the lockdown and the necessity to reopen, using those moral terms. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The article argues that the COVID-19 lockdown is not just a health versus economy issue but also a health versus health issue. The lockdown has led to serious consequences, including spiking suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, delayed diagnoses, and halted childhood vaccinations. Economic disparities have widened, with low-income workers disproportionately affected, and studies suggest that economic devastation could kill more people than the virus itself. The author emphasizes that reopening is necessary to mitigate these health risks, as many areas have not experienced coronavirus deaths. They call for responsible decisions based on scientific data, allowing people to choose to take risks safely. The author criticizes the ruling class for imposing restrictions while workers face economic livelihoods and personal health risks. It's time to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently, with sympathy and respect for those who have everything at stake. END OF SUMMARY.
