SUMMARY:

The lockdown is not just a health-vs-economy issue, but a health-vs-health issue. The consequences of keeping the economy shut down are severe, including spiking suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and widening economic disparity between the rich and poor. The goal of "flattening the curve" was to ensure localities had hospital beds and testing available, which we now have. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. The lockdown has devastating health implications, including a 1,000% increase in mental health hotline texts, delayed cancer diagnoses, and increased risk of domestic violence and child mortality. The economic devastation disproportionately affects low-income workers, with 40% of former workers living in households earning $40,000 or less losing work. It's time to reopen the economy, with state and local officials making responsible decisions based on scientific data. We must show sympathy and respect for working-class Americans who have everything at stake.

END OF SUMMARY.
