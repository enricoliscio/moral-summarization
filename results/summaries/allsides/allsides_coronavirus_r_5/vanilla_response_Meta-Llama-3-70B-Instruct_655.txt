SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but also a health-versus-health issue. The lockdown has led to serious health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and poor has also widened, with low-income workers being disproportionately affected. The article cites statistics showing the devastating impact of the lockdown on mental health, cancer diagnoses, and domestic violence. It also notes that the economic devastation could ultimately kill more people than the virus itself. The author argues that it's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, allowing responsible reopening of the economy based on scientific data. This would enable average Americans to take calculated risks to support their families and livelihoods.
