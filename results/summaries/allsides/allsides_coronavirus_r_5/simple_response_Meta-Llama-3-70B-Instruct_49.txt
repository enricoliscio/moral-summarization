SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. While staying at home may prevent COVID-19 cases, it also leads to serious health consequences such as increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. Moreover, the economic disparity between the rich and the poor worsens, which has its own health implications. The article cites statistics showing a significant increase in mental health issues, missed cancer diagnoses, and potential deaths from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. It also highlights the devastating economic impact on low-income workers and the ultra-poor, who may die from starvation and poverty. The author concludes that it's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, allowing responsible reopenings based on scientific data, and showing sympathy and respect for working-class Americans who have everything at stake.

END OF SUMMARY.
