Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article argues that the lockdown isn't just about health vs. economy but also health vs. health. It highlights negative consequences like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and economic disparities. The author uses strong moral words like "reopen," "devastate," "die," and "sympathy." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key moral points: the lockdown's impact on mental health, delayed medical treatments, economic inequality, and the call to reopen responsibly. The author emphasizes that reopening is necessary to prevent further health issues and economic suffering.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these points, using the specified moral words. I'll mention the statistics about mental health, cancer screenings, and suicides to show the consequences. Then, I'll talk about the economic impact and how it affects vulnerable groups. Finally, I'll conclude with the call to reopen based on scientific data and the need for empathy towards workers.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll make sure to preserve the moral framing by using the author's words where possible. Let me put it all together, making sure each sentence supports the moral argument for reopening.

SUMMARY: The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue but also a health-versus-health issue. Keeping the economy shut down has serious consequences, such as spiking suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, delayed diagnoses, and children without vaccinations. The economic devastation has widened disparities, with low-income workers disproportionately affected, and experts warn that poverty and starvation could kill more people than the virus itself. The author emphasizes that reopening is necessary, as the U.S. now has the resources to mitigate risks, and many areas are safe to reopen. The lockdown has been extended beyond its original goal, which was to flatten the curve, and now it risks devastating both the economy and public health. The author calls for prudent reopening based on scientific data, highlighting that workers have everything at stake, from their health to their livelihoods. They argue for sympathy and respect for these workers, who must choose to take risks safely and responsibly. END OF SUMMARY.
