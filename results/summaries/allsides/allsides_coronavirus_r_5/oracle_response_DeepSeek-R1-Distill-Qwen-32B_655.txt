Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The author emphasizes the health consequences of keeping the economy closed and argues for reopening. I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible from the list provided. Let me break down the key points:

1. The lockdown isn't just about health vs. economy; it's health vs. health. The author lists several negative health impacts like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, etc.
2. Economic disparities are widening, affecting health outcomes. The U.N. and World Vision are cited for starvation and child deaths.
3. The author argues that reopening is necessary, using statistics about low infection rates in many counties.
4. The working class is disproportionately affected, and they deserve respect and choice in managing risks.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, using words like "reopen," "consequences," "devastate," "mitigate," etc. I'll structure it to highlight the moral argument for reopening while acknowledging the risks.

SUMMARY: The author argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue but also a health-versus-health issue, with severe consequences for mental and physical health. Suicide rates are spiking, cancer screenings are declining, and childhood vaccinations are being missed, while economic disparities are widening, leading to worse health outcomes. The author emphasizes that reopening the economy is necessary, as the U.S. now has the resources to mitigate risks, and many counties are safe to reopen. The working class, disproportionately affected by job losses, deserves the choice to manage risks responsibly, rather than facing judgment from those less impacted. The article highlights the moral imperative to ease restrictions and support workers, acknowledging the risks but advocating for a prudent approach to reopening. END OF SUMMARY.
