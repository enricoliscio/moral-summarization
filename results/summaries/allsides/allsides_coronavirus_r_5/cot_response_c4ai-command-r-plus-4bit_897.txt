SUMMARY:
The coronavirus lockdown has been framed primarily as a choice between health and the economy, but it is important to recognize that keeping the economy shut down has serious health consequences as well. Suicide rates have spiked, cancer screenings have declined, and economic inequality has widened, all of which have significant health implications. The goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and resources such as hospital beds and testing are now available to mitigate the risks of reopening the economy. However, the goalposts have shifted to "stay-at-home until a cure is found," which could devastate the nation's health and economy. Since the lockdown began, there has been a drastic increase in mental health issues, missed cancer diagnoses, drug abuse, domestic violence, and childhood vaccination delays. Additionally, economic inequality has widened, with low-income workers being disproportionately affected by job losses. The health of a population is closely linked to economic inequality, and greater inequality leads to worse health outcomes. It is crucial to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently, with state and local officials making informed decisions based on scientific data. While there are risks associated with reopening, many counties in the U.S. have not reported any coronavirus deaths, and the majority of cases are concentrated in a small percentage of counties. The choice to reopen the economy is not a one-size-fits-all decision, but it is necessary to give Americans the choice to take calculated risks to support their personal health and economic livelihoods.
