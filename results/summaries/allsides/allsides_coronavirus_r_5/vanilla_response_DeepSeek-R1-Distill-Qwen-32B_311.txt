Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The main point is that the lockdown isn't just about health versus the economy, but also health versus health. There are negative health effects from keeping the economy closed, like increased suicides, less cancer screenings, and more domestic abuse. Also, the economic impact is hitting low-income workers harder, which has its own health risks. The article mentions that while there are risks to reopening, we have the resources now to manage them. They argue that many areas are safe to reopen and that workers deserve the choice to take risks responsibly. The author is from America First Policies. 

So, the summary should cover the health consequences of lockdowns, economic disparities, and the argument for reopening based on available resources. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

SUMMARY: The article argues that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused significant health and economic consequences, beyond the direct impact of the virus. Increased suicides, delayed medical treatments, and missed vaccinations are among the health risks, while low-income workers face disproportionate economic hardship. The author contends that reopening the economy is necessary, as the U.S. now has the resources to manage risks, such as hospital beds and testing. Many counties have few or no COVID-19 deaths, suggesting areas are safe to reopen. Workers deserve the choice to resume activities responsibly, rather than facing judgment from those less affected. The article emphasizes the need for prudent, data-driven decisions to balance health and economic well-being. END OF SUMMARY.
