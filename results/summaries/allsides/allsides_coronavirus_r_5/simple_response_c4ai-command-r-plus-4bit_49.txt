SUMMARY: The lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 has serious health consequences that go beyond the virus itself. Suicide rates, cardiac procedures, cancer screenings, and childhood vaccinations have all been negatively impacted. Economic inequality is widening, which has its own health implications. The lockdown is thus a health-versus-health issue, not just a health-versus-economy issue.

Reopening the economy is a risky but necessary step. Resources like hospital beds and testing are now available to mitigate these risks, and it is important to recognize that the lockdown has affected the working class disproportionately. They are the ones who must continue to put food on the table and support their families, often without the privilege of working from home. 

The article concludes by calling for empathy and respect for workers who are risking their health and economic well-being by returning to work, rather than judgment from the ruling class.

END OF SUMMARY.
