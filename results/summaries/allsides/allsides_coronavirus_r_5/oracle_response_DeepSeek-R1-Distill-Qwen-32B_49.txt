Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author argues that the lockdown isn't just about health vs. economy but also health vs. health. They mention various negative consequences like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and economic disparities. They also point out that some areas are safe to reopen and criticize the ruling class for not considering the working class's plight.

I need to capture these points concisely. I'll start by stating that the lockdown has health consequences beyond just the pandemic. Then, list the specific issues like suicide rates, cancer screenings, vaccinations, etc. Next, address the economic impact and how it affects health. Mention the data about counties with low COVID cases and the call for prudent reopening. Finally, highlight the unfairness faced by workers and the need for support.

I'll make sure to use words like "reopen," "consequences," "devastate," "die," "sympathy," etc., from the provided list. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring it's under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The author argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue but also a health-versus-health issue, with serious consequences for mental and physical well-being. Keeping the economy shut down has led to spiking suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, delayed diagnoses, and a decline in childhood vaccinations. The economic devastation has exacerbated disparities, with low-income workers disproportionately affected, and the U.N. warns of potential starvation and death for millions globally. The author emphasizes that while reopening carries risks, it is now possible with available hospital beds and testing to mitigate these risks. Many counties in the U.S. have not experienced coronavirus deaths, making it safe to reopen in those areas. The author calls for responsible, data-driven decisions to ease restrictions and manage the virus prudently, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach. Workers, especially those in low-income households, deserve sympathy and respect as they face the choice of risking their health to support their families. END OF SUMMARY.
