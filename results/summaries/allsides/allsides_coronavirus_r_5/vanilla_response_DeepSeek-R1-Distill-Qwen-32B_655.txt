Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a news summary. The article is about reopening the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main points seem to be that the lockdown isn't just about health vs. economy, but also health vs. health. They mention various negative health consequences like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and domestic violence. Also, economic disparities are widening, affecting low-income workers more. The article argues that the economy needs to reopen because the current restrictions are causing more harm than good, citing statistics and expert opinions. The user wants a concise summary, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I need to make sure I capture all the key points: the health issues from lockdown, economic impact, the argument for reopening, and the call for responsible decisions. I should keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it by first stating the main argument, then listing the health and economic consequences, and finally the call to action. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

The piece calls for empathy and responsible decision-making from officials, acknowledging the sacrifices of average Americans during the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
