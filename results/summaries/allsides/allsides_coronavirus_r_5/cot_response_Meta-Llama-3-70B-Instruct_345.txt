SUMMARY:
The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, the consequences of keeping it shut down are severe. Suicide rates are spiking, cardiac procedures are being delayed, and cancer screenings are declining. The economic disparity between the rich and poor is widening, with devastating health implications. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. State and local officials must make responsible decisions on how and when to reopen based on scientific data. The working class, who have everything at stake, deserve sympathy and respect for their desire to take calculated risks to support their families. It's time to reopen the economy, not just to save the economy, but to save lives. END OF SUMMARY.
