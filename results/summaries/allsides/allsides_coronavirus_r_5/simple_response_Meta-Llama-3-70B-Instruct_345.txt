SUMMARY:

The lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. The consequences of keeping the economy shut down are severe, with rising suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and increased economic disparity between the rich and poor. The goal of "flattening the curve" was to ensure localities had hospital beds and testing available, which is now the case. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently. The ultra-poor are disproportionately affected, with the UN predicting 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. State and local officials must make responsible decisions on how and when to reopen based on scientific data. Many areas of the country are safe to reopen, and Americans are asking for the choice to take the risk of reopening safely and responsibly. Instead of judgment, there should be sympathy and respect for workers who have everything at stake.

END OF SUMMARY.
