SUMMARY: In a bid to protect the health of Americans, the lockdown has inadvertently caused a host of other health issues, from missed cancer screenings to a rise in domestic violence and a projected increase in deaths from drug abuse and suicide. Economic inequality is widening, with devastating health implications for the poor. While the initial goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, some now call for a prolonged lockdown until a cure is found, which could devastate the economy and the health of the nation. There are risks to reopening, but resources are now available to mitigate them, and the benefits of restarting the economy may outweigh the risks. In some parts of the country, there have been no coronavirus deaths, indicating that a gradual reopening is possible and necessary to balance health and economic concerns. The decision to reopen should be based on scientific data and local conditions, with consideration for the working class, who have the most to lose if the lockdown continues.
END OF SUMMARY.
