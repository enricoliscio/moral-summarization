Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article argues that reopening the economy is crucial because the lockdown isn't just about health versus the economy, but also health versus health. It mentions various negative health consequences like increased suicides, missed cancer screenings, and domestic violence. It also talks about economic disparities, especially how low-income workers are affected more.

The author is critical of the media and political elites, suggesting they're framing it as a health vs. economy issue, but it's more about health on both fronts. They mention that the initial goal was to flatten the curve to get resources in place, which has been achieved, so now it's time to reopen.

There are statistics provided about the rise in mental health issues, cancer screenings dropping, and projected deaths from substance abuse and suicide. The economic impact is also highlighted, with the ultra-poor being hit hardest, potentially leading to more deaths than the virus itself.

The article also points out that reopening should be based on scientific data, and many areas are safe to reopen. It criticizes the ruling class for making decisions without the same stakes, as they can work from home, while average Americans have to work to support their families.

So, the moral framing here is that the lockdown is causing significant health and economic harms, disproportionately affecting the poor, and that the government should prioritize reopening to prevent further damage. The author emphasizes the workers' right to choose their risk responsibly and the need for empathy from the ruling class.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral perspective intact. I should highlight the health consequences, economic disparities, the argument for reopening based on available resources, and the criticism of the ruling class's decisions.
