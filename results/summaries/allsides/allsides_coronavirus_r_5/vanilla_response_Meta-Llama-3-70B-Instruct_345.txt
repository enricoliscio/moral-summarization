SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but also a health-versus-health issue. The lockdown has led to serious health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and poor has also worsened, with low-income workers being disproportionately affected. The article cites statistics showing the devastating impact of the lockdown, including a 1,000% increase in mental health hotline texts and a projected 80,000 missed cancer diagnoses. It argues that the goal of "flattening the curve" has been achieved, and it's now time to reopen the economy prudently, with state and local officials making responsible decisions based on scientific data. The article concludes that Americans want the choice to take risks safely and responsibly, and that sympathy and respect should be given to working-class individuals who have everything at stake.
