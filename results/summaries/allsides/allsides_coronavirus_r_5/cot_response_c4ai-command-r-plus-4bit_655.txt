SUMMARY:
The coronavirus lockdown is not just about health versus the economy, but also about health versus health. Reopening the economy is necessary to address the serious health consequences of the lockdown, such as spikes in suicide rates, missed cancer screenings, and widening economic disparity, which has its own health implications. While there are risks to reopening, we now have the resources to mitigate these risks and manage the virus prudently. State and local officials need to make responsible decisions based on scientific data and recognize that there are wide swathes of the country that are safe to reopen. The lockdown has disproportionately affected low-income workers, and greater economic inequality leads to worse health outcomes. Instead of judgment, there should be sympathy and respect for the working class, who have their personal health and economic livelihoods at stake. It's time to give Americans the choice to take the risk of reopening safely and responsibly. END OF SUMMARY.
