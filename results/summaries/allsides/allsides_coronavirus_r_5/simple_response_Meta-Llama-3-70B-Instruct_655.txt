SUMMARY:

The article argues that the coronavirus lockdown is not just a health-versus-economy issue, but a health-versus-health issue. While there are risks associated with reopening the economy, the lockdown is having severe health consequences, including increased suicide rates, delayed cancer screenings, and decreased childhood vaccinations. The economic disparity between the rich and poor is also having health implications. The article cites statistics showing the devastating effects of the lockdown, including a 1,000% increase in mental health hotline texts and 75,000 potential deaths from drug abuse and suicide. It's time to ease up restrictions and manage the virus prudently, with state and local officials making responsible decisions based on scientific data. The article calls for sympathy and respect for working-class Americans who are bearing the brunt of the lockdown, rather than judgment from the ruling class.
