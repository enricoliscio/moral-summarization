Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand its main points. The article argues against prolonged lockdowns, highlighting the health consequences of economic shutdowns, such as increased suicides, missed medical screenings, and economic disparities. It also mentions the impact on vulnerable populations and the need to reopen based on data.

The user wants me to identify morally framed words first. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral weight, like "devastate," "sacrifice," "oppress," etc. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes these words to maintain the original moral perspective.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures the essence of the argument: reopening is necessary to prevent worse health outcomes and economic suffering, while acknowledging the risks. I'll structure it to highlight the health consequences of lockdowns and the need for a balanced approach based on data.

Finally, I'll present the identified words in STEP 1 and the summary under SUMMARY, making sure to end with the specified tokens. I need to ensure clarity and that the moral framing is preserved without adding my own opinions.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article argues that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused significant health and economic harm, framing the issue as a health-versus-health dilemma rather than just a health-versus-economy debate. It highlights the surge in suicides, missed medical screenings, and delayed cancer diagnoses, as well as the widening economic disparity between the rich and the poor. The author emphasizes that the prolonged lockdown could lead to more deaths from economic hardship than the virus itself, citing statistics on increased domestic violence, mental health crises, and food insecurity. The article criticizes the "one-size-fits-all" approach to reopening, suggesting that many areas are safe to reopen based on scientific data. It calls for empathy and respect for working-class Americans who face both health and economic risks, urging policymakers to balance safety with economic livelihood. The author argues that the current approach sacrifices vulnerable populations and exploits their desperation. END OF SUMMARY.
