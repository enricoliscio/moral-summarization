SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against coronavirus restrictions and hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to celebrate freedom and oppose the coronavirus shutdown. The rally, which started as a celebration of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against the governor's restrictions. Protestors marched to the governor's house and later hung an effigy with his face on it from a tree at the capitol. The effigy was quickly taken down, and the actions were condemned by members of both parties, including Senator Mitch McConnell and Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams. Many others, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, also spoke out against the hanging of the effigy, calling it unacceptable and beyond reprehensible.
END OF SUMMARY.
