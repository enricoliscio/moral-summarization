SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned controversial when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom" and fight against coronavirus restrictions. Around 100 people attended, marching to the governor's house and shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, with Beshear's face and a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants," was later taken down. The action sparked swift backlash from both parties, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans condemning the effigy as "unacceptable" and "disgusting." Democrats, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, also denounced the act as "beyond reprehensible" and "vile." The incident has drawn widespread criticism, with many calling for respect and civility in political discourse.
