SUMMARY:

Protesters in Kentucky sparked outrage by hanging an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, an act widely condemned as "hate" and "vile". The protest, meant to "fight back" against coronavirus restrictions, turned into a call to "protect" freedom and defy the "shutdown". The effigy, bearing a message that translates to "thus always to tyrants", was seen as a threat, prompting swift backlash from both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other politicians denounced the "action" as "unacceptable" and "beyond reprehensible", emphasizing the importance of "honoring" those who gave their lives for the country. They urged the need to "protect" the community from the pandemic by making "small sacrifices" and sharing "science" to keep each other "healthy" and "safe". The incident was seen as a disturbing display of "hate" on Memorial Day weekend.
