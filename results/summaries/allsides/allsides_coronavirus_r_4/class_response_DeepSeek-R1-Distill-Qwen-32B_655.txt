Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Beshear, which is a strong symbolic act. They were protesting against coronavirus restrictions, using terms like "shutdown" and "fight." The protest started with celebrating the Second Amendment but turned into opposing the governor's policies.

I should note the actions taken by the protestors, such as "marched," "shouting," and "hanging" the effigy. The effigy had a message in Latin, which adds a historical or symbolic moral weight. 

Next, the backlash from political figures is important. McConnell and others condemned the protest, using strong terms like "unacceptable," "hate," and "disgusting." These words highlight the moral judgment against the protest.

I also need to include the context, like it being Memorial Day weekend, which ties into honoring those who fought for freedom. The governor's supporters argue that protecting the community and following science leads to freedom, which is another moral point.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements, using the key morally framed words. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence of the protest and the reactions, preserving the moral tone.

SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration to "fight" against coronavirus restrictions, calling them an "unconstitutional shutdown." The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began with celebrating the Second Amendment but escalated into a rally against the governor's policies. Protestors "marched" to Beshear's house, shouting "Come out Andy," before returning to the capitol to "hang" the effigy, which bore the governor's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies." The act sparked widespread condemnation, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell calling it "unacceptable" and "hate-filled," while Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer described it as a "vile act" that undermines efforts to "protect" the community. Many criticized the "disgusting" display, emphasizing the importance of "freedom" and "safety" during the pandemic. The protest was widely condemned as "beyond reprehensible." END OF SUMMARY.
