Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." The article is about a protest in Kentucky where an effigy of Governor Beshear was hung.

First, I'll identify the key points: the protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, about 100 people, started with celebrating the Second Amendment, then turned against coronavirus restrictions. They marched to the governor's house, hung an effigy with a Latin phrase, and it was taken down quickly. There was backlash from both parties, including McConnell and Fischer.

I should mention the protest's purpose, the effigy's details, the quick removal, and the condemnations from political figures. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure to include all these elements without extra details. Also, I need to structure it clearly, starting with the protest, the effigy, and then the reactions.

Let me put it together, making sure it's concise and covers all necessary points.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a rally organized by Take Back Kentucky, which aimed to protest coronavirus restrictions. The event, which began with celebrating the Second Amendment, saw around 100 people march to the governor's house and later return to the capitol to hang the effigy with the message "sic temper tyrannies." The effigy was removed shortly after. The action drew widespread condemnation, with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic leaders denouncing it as unacceptable and hate-filled. Many criticized the protest, calling it "disgusting" and "vile," especially during Memorial Day weekend. END OF SUMMARY.
