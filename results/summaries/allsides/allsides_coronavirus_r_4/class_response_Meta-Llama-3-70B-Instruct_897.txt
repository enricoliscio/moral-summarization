SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown" over the coronavirus. However, the protest escalated into a call against coronavirus restrictions, with around 100 people marching to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was eventually taken down. The actions were deemed "unacceptable" and "disgusting" by politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned the "hate" and "vile act." Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted that the act was "beyond reprehensible" and urged the importance of "protecting" the community from the pandemic. The incident was widely denounced, with many calling for "freedom" and "safety" to prevail.
