Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a protest in Kentucky where protestors hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. They were against coronavirus restrictions. The protest started with celebrating the Second Amendment but turned into anti-coronavirus measures. They went to the governor's house and then back to the capitol where they hung the effigy with a Latin phrase. The effigy was taken down quickly. Both parties condemned the action, with McConnell saying it went too far, and others like Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats also criticizing it.

I should make sure the summary includes the main points: who, what, when, where, why. The key elements are the protest by Take Back Kentucky, the effigy hanging, the reasons behind it, the reaction from politicians, and the quick removal of the effigy. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the protest and the effigy, then the reasons, followed by the backlash from both parties, and end with the removal of the effigy. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text.

The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began with celebrating the Second Amendment but shifted focus to opposing pandemic-related shutdowns. Protestors marched to Beshear's home and later returned to the state capitol, where they hung the effigy with the message "sic temper tyrannies." The effigy was quickly removed. Both Republican and Democratic leaders condemned the action, with Sen. Mitch McConnell calling it unacceptable and Democratic Mayor Greg Fischer denouncing it as vile. The protest drew widespread criticism for its inflammatory nature. END OF SUMMARY.
