SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned unacceptable when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back" against coronavirus restrictions. However, the protest took a dark turn when around 100 people marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy," and later hung the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," a Latin phrase that translates to "thus always to tyrants." The act was swiftly denounced by lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it "unacceptable" and said there is "no place for hate in Kentucky." Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, condemned the "vile act" and urged the importance of protecting the community from the pandemic. The morally reprehensible act was eventually taken down, but not before it sparked outrage and calls for unity. END OF SUMMARY.
