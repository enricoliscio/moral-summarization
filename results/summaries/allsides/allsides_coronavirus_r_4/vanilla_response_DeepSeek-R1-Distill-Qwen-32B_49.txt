Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a protest in Kentucky where demonstrators hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear. They were protesting against coronavirus restrictions. The protest started with celebrating the Second Amendment but shifted focus. They also went to the governor's house and shouted for him to come out. The effigy had a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants."

I should note the key points: the protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, around 100 people, the effigy incident, the backlash from both parties, including McConnell and others. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements. I need to make sure it's clear and captures the main events and reactions. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the protest details, then the backlash, and end with the broader implications. Also, I need to mention the Latin phrase correctly and its translation. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be brief but comprehensive.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear during a rally organized by Take Back Kentucky to oppose coronavirus restrictions. The protest, which began with celebrating the Second Amendment, turned into a call against pandemic lockdowns. Protesters marched to Beshear's home, shouting for him to come out, before returning to the capitol to hang the effigy, which bore the phrase "sic temper tyrannies" ("thus always to tyrants"). The effigy was quickly removed. The action sparked widespread condemnation, including from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who criticized it as unacceptable despite supporting free speech. Other Republicans and Democrats also condemned the act, with some calling it "disgusting" and "vile." The protest occurred during Memorial Day weekend, highlighting divisions over pandemic restrictions and freedom of speech. END OF SUMMARY.
