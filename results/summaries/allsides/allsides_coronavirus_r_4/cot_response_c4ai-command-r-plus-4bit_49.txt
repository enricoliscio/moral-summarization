SUMMARY:
Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's governor, Andy Beshear, by hanging an effigy with his likeness and the message "sic temper tyrannis" (thus always to tyrants). The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to celebrate freedom and fight against what they saw as an unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus. The rally, which began as a celebration of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against coronavirus restrictions. Protestors marched to the governor’s house shouting “Come out Andy,” and later hung the effigy from a tree at the state capitol. This act was swiftly condemned by members of both parties as unacceptable and hateful. Many officials spoke out against the effigy hanging, calling it a vile act, especially on Memorial Day weekend when honor is given to those who gave their lives for freedom. They emphasized the importance of keeping the community healthy and safe during the pandemic. The Kentucky House Democrats also issued a statement, calling the effigy "beyond reprehensible."
