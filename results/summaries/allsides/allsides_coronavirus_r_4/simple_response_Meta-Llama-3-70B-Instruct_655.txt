SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom" and fight against coronavirus restrictions. However, the event took a dark turn when around 100 protesters marched to the governor's house and later hung the effigy, which featured a picture of Beshear's face and a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants." The backlash was swift, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other prominent Republicans denouncing the act as "unacceptable" and "disgusting." Democratic officials, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also condemned the effigy, calling it "beyond reprehensible" and "vile." The incident has sparked outrage and raised concerns about the erosion of civility in political discourse.
