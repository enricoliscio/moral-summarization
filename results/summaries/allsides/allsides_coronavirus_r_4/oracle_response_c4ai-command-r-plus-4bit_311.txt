SUMMARY: A group of protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight back against what they saw as unconstitutional restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The rally, which started as a celebration of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against these restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, and later hung the effigy from a tree with a message that read "sic temper tyrannis," translating to "thus always to tyrants." This act caused swift backlash from members of both parties, who condemned the protestors' actions as unacceptable and hateful. Many saw the effigy hanging as a vile act, especially during a time when honoring those who fought for freedom and protecting the community's health and safety should be paramount. The hanging of the effigy was a shocking display that crossed a line and was seen as beyond reprehensible.
END OF SUMMARY.
