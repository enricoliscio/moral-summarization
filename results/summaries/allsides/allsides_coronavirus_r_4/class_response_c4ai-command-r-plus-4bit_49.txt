SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight against the coronavirus shutdown restrictions. Around 100 people participated in the rally, initially celebrating the Second Amendment before turning their anger towards the governor. They marched to his house, shouting threats, and later hung the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannis," or "thus always to tyrants." This act caused swift and strong backlash from members of both political parties, who condemned the protest as unacceptable, hateful, and disgusting. Leaders from both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, spoke out against the act, defending the right to peaceful protest but drawing a line at the unacceptable display of hate and threats. The effigy was quickly taken down, but the incident underscores the deep moral divide in the country and the challenges faced by those trying to protect public health and safety during a pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
