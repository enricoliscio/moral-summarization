Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: fight, shutdown, hanging, actions, action, hate, honor, protect, act, healthy, safe, effigy. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. The protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, aiming to celebrate freedom and fight against coronavirus shutdowns. They started with the Second Amendment but then focused on COVID restrictions. They marched to the governor's house and hung the effigy with a Latin phrase. The effigy was taken down quickly. There was a lot of backlash from both parties, with McConnell and others condemning the actions as hate and unacceptable.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with the protest, mention the effigy, the purpose, the rally turning against shutdowns, the march, the effigy details, and the backlash. Use the moral words where appropriate. For example, "fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown," "actions went too far," "condemned the effigy as hate," "honor those who gave their lives," "protect our community," "vile act," "healthy and safe," "beyond reprehensible."

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where it fits naturally.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, aiming to "fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown" of businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began by celebrating the Second Amendment but turned into a call against COVID-19 restrictions. Protesters marched to Beshear's home, chanting "Come out Andy," before returning to the capitol, where they hung the effigy with the message "sic temper tyrannies." The effigy was taken down shortly after. The actions drew widespread condemnation, with Sen. Mitch McConnell calling the protest "unacceptable" and "hate-filled." Others, including Democratic Mayor Greg Fischer, condemned the "vile act," emphasizing the importance of "sharing science" and "keeping each other healthy and safe." Kentucky House Democrats also strongly condemned the "reprehensible" act. END OF SUMMARY.
