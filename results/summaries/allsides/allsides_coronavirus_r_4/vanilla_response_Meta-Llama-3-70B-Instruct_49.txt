SUMMARY:

Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol on Sunday, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus." Around 100 people attended, marching to the governor's house and shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, with Beshear's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was later taken down. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, as well as Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, denounced the act, calling it "unacceptable," "disgusting," and "beyond reprehensible." The backlash emphasized the importance of peaceful protest and respect for elected officials.
