SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned unacceptable when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back" against coronavirus restrictions. However, the protest escalated into a call to action, with around 100 people marching to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was eventually taken down. The act was deemed "disgusting" and "beyond reprehensible" by lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who emphasized that there is "no place for hate in Kentucky." The incident drew strong criticism, with many calling for respect and safety during the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
