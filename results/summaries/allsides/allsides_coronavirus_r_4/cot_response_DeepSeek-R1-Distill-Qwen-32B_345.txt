Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, they want me to identify all the morally framed single words in the text. Then, I have to summarize the article while preserving those moral framings. 

Let me start by reading the article carefully. The main points are about a protest in Kentucky where an effigy of Governor Beshear was hung. The protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, opposing coronavirus restrictions. The effigy had a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants." There's backlash from various politicians, including McConnell and Fischer, who condemned the act as unacceptable, hate-filled, and disgusting.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to extract the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "protestors," "unconstitutional," "celebrate," "freedom," "shutdown," "unconstitutional," "Second Amendment," "call," "against," "coronavirus," "restrictions," "marched," "shouting," "effigy," "Latin," "tyrannies," "condemned," "unacceptable," "hate," "disgusting," "condemn," "vile," "sacrifices," "protect," "science," "healthy," "safe," "freedom," "reprehensible." These words all carry moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval of actions or policies.

Moving on to the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise version, keeping the moral language intact. I'll start by mentioning the protest and the effigy, then the organizers' reasons, the rally's progression, the march to the governor's house, the hanging of the effigy, and the backlash from McConnell, Adams, Fischer, and the Kentucky House Democrats. I should ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and includes as many morally framed words as possible.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: describe the event, the organizers' stance, the rally's progression, the backlash, and the politicians' condemnations. This way, the moral framing is preserved, and the summary remains clear and concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear, criticizing his coronavirus restrictions, which they deemed "unconstitutional." The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, started with celebrating the Second Amendment but escalated into a rally against pandemic measures. Protestors marched to Beshear's home, shouting for him to come out, and later returned to the state capitol to hang the effigy, which bore the phrase "sic temper tyrannies." The act sparked widespread condemnation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, while supporting free speech, called the action "unacceptable" and "hate-filled." Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also condemned the "disgusting" and "vile" act, emphasizing the importance of unity and science during the pandemic. Kentucky House Democrats labeled the protest "beyond reprehensible."
