SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hanged an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, started as a celebration of the Second Amendment but turned into a rally against the governor's coronavirus shutdown measures. Around 100 people marched to the governor's house, later returning to the capitol where an effigy with Beshear's face and a message reading "sic temper tyrannies" was hanged from a tree. The effigy was quickly taken down, but the incident sparked swift backlash from both parties. Senator Mitch McConnell, while defending the right to peaceful protest, condemned the actions as unacceptable. Other Republican and Democratic officials also spoke out against the hanging, calling it disgusting, reprehensible, and unacceptable. The incident occurred during Memorial Day weekend, prompting Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer to reflect on the sacrifices made for freedom and the need to follow scientific guidance to protect the community during the pandemic.
END OF SUMMARY.
