SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky engaged in a disturbing act of aggression towards their governor, Andy Beshear, by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, meant to fight against the shutdown imposed due to the coronavirus, quickly turned into a display of hate and intimidation. The protestors, who initially gathered to celebrate the Second Amendment, marched to the governor's house shouting threats and later hung the effigy with a threatening message. This act was rightfully condemned by members of both parties, including Senator Mitch McConnell, who defended the right to peaceful protest but drew the line at the unacceptable actions of the protestors. Other politicians also spoke out against the hanging, honoring the values of freedom and protection from harm. The hanging of the effigy was a reprehensible act that goes against the very principles of a free and healthy democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
