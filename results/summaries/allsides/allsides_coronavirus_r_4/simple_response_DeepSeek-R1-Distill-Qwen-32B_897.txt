Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

So, there's a protest in Kentucky where they hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. The protest was against coronavirus restrictions. They started by celebrating the Second Amendment but then focused on the shutdown. They marched to the governor's house and then back to the capitol where they hung the effigy with a Latin phrase. The effigy was taken down quickly.

Now, the moral framing here is important. The article mentions backlash from both parties. McConnell says it's unacceptable, even though he supports the First Amendment. Others, like Fischer, link it to hate and compare it to Booth's words, which is a strong condemnation.

I need to capture that the protest was against the shutdown, the use of the effigy, and the strong reactions against it. Also, the moral stance is clear: the actions were condemned as hate and unacceptable, even by Republicans.

I should structure the summary to include the protest details, the effigy, the Latin phrase, and the condemnations from both parties. Make sure to highlight the moral judgment against the protesters' actions.

Let me put this together concisely, keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral elements are clear.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, part of a rally organized by Take Back Kentucky to oppose coronavirus restrictions. The event, which began with celebrations of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against the governor's shutdown measures. Protesters marched to Beshear's home and later returned to the capitol, where they hung the effigy with a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was quickly removed. The action sparked widespread condemnation, with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and others denouncing it as unacceptable and hate-filled. Democratic officials also condemned the act, emphasizing the importance of unity and science during the pandemic. The protest was widely criticized as excessive and contrary to principles of respect and freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
