SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned unacceptable when demonstrators hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom" and "fight back" against coronavirus restrictions. However, the protest escalated into a call to action, with around 100 people marching to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, featuring a picture of Beshear's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was later taken down. The act was deemed "disgusting" and "beyond reprehensible" by lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who emphasized that there is "no place for hate in Kentucky." The incident was particularly jarring on Memorial Day weekend, when Americans honor those who gave their lives for their country. The backlash against the protest highlights the importance of peaceful assembly and respect for those in power.
