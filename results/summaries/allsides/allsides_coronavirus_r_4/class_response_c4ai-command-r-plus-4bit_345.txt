SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight back against what they saw as unconstitutional restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Carrying a message of "celebrating freedom," around 100 people initially gathered to celebrate the Second Amendment, but the rally soon turned into a call against coronavirus shutdown measures. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting for him to come out, and later hung an effigy with his face on it from a tree outside the capitol. This act was swiftly condemned by members of both parties as unacceptable and disgusting, with many denouncing the presence of hate and calling for protection of freedom through keeping the community safe. The effigy was taken down shortly after it was hung.
END OF SUMMARY.
