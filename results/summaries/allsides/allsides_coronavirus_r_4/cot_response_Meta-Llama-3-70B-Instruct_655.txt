SUMMARY:
A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus." However, it escalated into a call against coronavirus restrictions, with protesters marching to the governor's house and later hanging the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," a Latin phrase that translates to "thus always to tyrants." The act was swiftly denounced by politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it "unacceptable" and stated that "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." Others, including Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also condemned the "disgusting" and "vile" act, calling it "beyond reprehensible."
