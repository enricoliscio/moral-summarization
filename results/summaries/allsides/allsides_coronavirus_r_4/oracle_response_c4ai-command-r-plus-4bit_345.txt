SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight back against what they saw as unconstitutional restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. While the initial focus of the rally was celebrating the Second Amendment, it eventually turned into a call against these restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting for him to come out, and later returned to the capitol, where an effigy with the governor's face and the message "sic temper tyrannis" was hung from a tree. This action caused widespread backlash, with members of both parties condemning the protest. Many saw it as a hateful act, dishonoring the values of freedom and protection that the protest aimed to promote. The effigy was taken down shortly after, but the incident underscores the deep divisions and strong emotions surrounding the response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

END OF SUMMARY.
