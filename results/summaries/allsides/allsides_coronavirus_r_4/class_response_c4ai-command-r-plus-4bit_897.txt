SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight back against what they saw as unconstitutional restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Around 100 people participated in the protest, initially celebrating the Second Amendment before turning their attention to the coronavirus restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting at him to come out, and later returned to the state capitol, where an effigy of the governor was hung from a tree. This act caused swift backlash from members of both parties, who condemned the protestor's actions as unacceptable and hateful. Many saw the hanging of the effigy as a disgusting and beyond reprehensible act, especially on Memorial Day weekend when honoring those who gave their lives for the country. The protestor's actions were seen as a threat to the freedom and safety of the community.
END OF SUMMARY.
