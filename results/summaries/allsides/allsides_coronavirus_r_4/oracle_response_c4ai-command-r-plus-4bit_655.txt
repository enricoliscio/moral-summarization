SUMMARY: A protest in Kentucky against the state's shutdown over the coronavirus turned into a display of hate and intimidation. Around 100 protestors, initially gathered to celebrate the Second Amendment, marched on the governor's house shouting threats and later hanged an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. This act of intimidation, with a message reading "sic temper tyrannis," drew swift backlash from members of both parties. The protestor's actions were condemned as unacceptable, with Senator Mitch McConnell stating that "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also spoke out against the effigy hanging, emphasizing the importance of protecting public health and safety during a pandemic. The Kentucky House Democrats' statement against the effigy called it "beyond reprehensible." These strong reactions highlight the moral outrage sparked by the protestors' actions, which crossed a line by invoking imagery of violence and threatening the governor.
END OF SUMMARY.
