Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the protests in Kentucky. The user provided the article, so I should read through it carefully.

First, I'll identify the main points. Protestors from Take Back Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. They were protesting coronavirus restrictions, celebrating the Second Amendment, and then moved to the governor's house. The effigy had a Latin phrase, and it was taken down quickly. There's backlash from both parties, including McConnell and Fischer.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll need to mention the protest, the effigy, the reasons behind it, and the reactions. I'll structure it to start with the protest, then the effigy, and end with the reactions.

I need to keep it clear and factual, avoiding any personal opinions. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence is brief and covers all key elements without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a rally organized by Take Back Kentucky to oppose coronavirus restrictions. The protest, which began with celebrating the Second Amendment, saw around 100 people marching to Beshear's home and later returning to the capitol to hang the effigy with a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was quickly removed. The action sparked widespread condemnation, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democratic officials alike denouncing it as unacceptable and hate-filled. Many criticized the protest, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who tied it to honoring those who fought for freedom and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
