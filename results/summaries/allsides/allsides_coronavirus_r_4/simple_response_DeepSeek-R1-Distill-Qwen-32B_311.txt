Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the protest in Kentucky. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about protesters hanging an effigy of Governor Beshear. They were part of Take Back Kentucky, protesting against coronavirus restrictions. They started with celebrating the Second Amendment, then moved to the governor's house, and then back to the capitol where they hung the effigy with a Latin phrase. The effigy was taken down quickly.

Now, the moral framing here is important. The protesters are seen as going too far, with backlash from both parties. McConnell supports free speech but condemns the action. Others call it disgusting and vile, tying it to hate and comparing it to Booth, who assassinated Lincoln.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: who did what, the context of the protest, the backlash, and the moral judgment. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

I'll structure it by starting with the protest details, then the backlash, highlighting the moral condemnation from both sides. Make sure to mention the effigy's message and the quick removal. Also, include the quotes from McConnell and Fischer to show the moral stance.

Let me put it all together concisely, ensuring I don't miss any crucial elements and keep the moral angle clear.

Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and others condemned the act, calling it unacceptable and hate-filled. Democratic leaders also criticized the protest, emphasizing the importance of unity and science during the pandemic. The backlash highlighted the moral and political divides over both the protest and the governor's policies. END OF SUMMARY.
