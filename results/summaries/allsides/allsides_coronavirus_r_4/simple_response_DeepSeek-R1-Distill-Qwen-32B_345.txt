Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a protest in Kentucky where they hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. The protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, and they were against coronavirus restrictions. They started by celebrating the Second Amendment but then turned to anti-coronavirus measures.

The key points are: the effigy was hung with a Latin phrase meaning "thus always to tyrants," which is a strong statement against the governor. There were around 100 people, and they also went to the governor's house shouting for him to come out. The effigy was taken down quickly.

Now, the moral framing is important. The protesters are seen as going too far, with both parties condemning the action. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, supports free speech but says this was unacceptable. Others, like the Secretary of State and the Democratic mayor, also condemned it, calling it disgusting and a vile act. The article highlights the backlash, showing that while protest is okay, this went beyond acceptable limits.

I need to make sure the summary includes the protest details, the effigy with the Latin phrase, the number of people, the march to the governor's house, the backlash from both parties, and the moral judgment that it's unacceptable. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral stance against the protesters' actions.

I'll structure it by first stating the protest and effigy, then the rally details, followed by the backlash and condemnations, emphasizing the moral disapproval.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions, organized by Take Back Kentucky. The rally, which began celebrating the Second Amendment, turned into a call against pandemic measures. Protesters marched to Beshear's home, shouting for him to come out, and later returned to the capitol to hang the effigy, which displayed a photo of Beshear and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies," meaning "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was quickly removed. The action drew widespread condemnation, with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell calling it unacceptable and "hate" having no place in Kentucky. Other officials, including Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams and Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also condemned the act, describing it as "disgusting" and "vile." The protest was widely criticized for crossing acceptable boundaries of free expression. END OF SUMMARY.
