SUMMARY:
Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's governor, Andy Beshear, by hanging an effigy with his likeness and the message "sic temper tyrannis," Latin for "thus always to tyrants." The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to celebrate freedom and oppose what they saw as an unconstitutional shutdown due to the coronavirus. Around 100 people participated in the demonstration, which began as a celebration of the Second Amendment but soon turned into a rally against coronavirus restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting for him to come out, and later returned to the state capitol, where the effigy was hung from a tree. This act was swiftly condemned by members of both parties as unacceptable, hateful, and vile. Many denounced the use of the phrase associated with John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, stating it had no place in the Party of Lincoln. The effigy was taken down shortly after, and officials emphasized the importance of honoring those who sacrificed for freedom by keeping the community healthy and safe during the pandemic. The Kentucky House Democrats also issued a strong condemnation, calling the act reprehensible.
