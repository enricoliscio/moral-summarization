SUMMARY:
A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to "celebrate freedom" but descended into a call against coronavirus restrictions. The effigy, with a picture of Beshear's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies" (meaning "thus always to tyrants"), was swiftly taken down. The actions were deemed "unacceptable" and "disgusting" by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned the display of "hate" in Kentucky. Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, also denounced the "vile" and "beyond reprehensible" act, which marred Memorial Day weekend. The incident highlights the importance of peaceful protest and respect for elected officials. END OF SUMMARY.
