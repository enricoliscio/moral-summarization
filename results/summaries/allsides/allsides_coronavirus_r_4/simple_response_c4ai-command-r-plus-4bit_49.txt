SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to "celebrate freedom and to fight back against the unconstitutional shutdown." The rally, which began as a celebration of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against the governor's coronavirus restrictions. Protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting for him to come out, and later hung an effigy with his face on it from a tree at the state capitol. This act caused swift backlash from members of both parties, who condemned the protestor's actions as unacceptable and hateful. Many denounced the hanging of the effigy, calling it "beyond reprehensible" and emphasizing that such acts have no place in a free and democratic society, especially during a time of national crisis and remembrance.
