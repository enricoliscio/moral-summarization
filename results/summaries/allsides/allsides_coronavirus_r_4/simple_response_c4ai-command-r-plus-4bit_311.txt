SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky crossed a moral line when they hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear during a rally against coronavirus restrictions. While freedom of speech is important, the protestors' actions were unacceptable and caused bipartisan backlash. The effigy, with a picture of the Governor's face and the words "sic temper tyrannis," was a disturbing act that invoked the memory of John Wilkes Booth and the assassination of President Lincoln. Senators, mayors, and other representatives from both parties swiftly condemned the act, emphasizing that such behavior has no place in a civilized society, especially on Memorial Day weekend when honor and sacrifice are at the forefront of our minds. The protest, which started as a celebration of the Second Amendment, took a dark turn and became a display of intimidation and threats. The hanging of an effigy is a symbol of violence and a rejection of the democratic process. It is a reminder that while we value freedom, we must always uphold the moral boundaries that protect the well-being and safety of our leaders and our communities.

END OF SUMMARY.
