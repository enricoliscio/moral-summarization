SUMMARY:

A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back" against coronavirus restrictions. However, the event escalated into a call to action against the governor, with protesters marching to his house and shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies," was eventually taken down. The act was swiftly denounced by politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it "unacceptable" and stated that "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, condemned the "vile act" and emphasized the importance of honoring those who have made sacrifices for the country and prioritizing community health and safety. The incident has sparked a strong backlash against the protesters' actions.
