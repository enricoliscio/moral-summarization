SUMMARY:

Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol on Sunday, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom" and fight against coronavirus restrictions. Around 100 people attended, marching to the governor's house and shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, featuring Beshear's face and a Latin phrase translating to "thus always to tyrants," was later taken down. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, as well as Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, condemned the act, calling it "unacceptable," "disgusting," and "beyond reprehensible." Many emphasized the importance of peaceful protest and respecting public officials, especially on Memorial Day weekend.
