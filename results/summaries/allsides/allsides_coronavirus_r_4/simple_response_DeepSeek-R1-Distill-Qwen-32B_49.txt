Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a protest in Kentucky where an effigy of the governor was hung. I need to make sure the summary captures the key points and the moral stance taken by the protesters and the backlash they received.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main elements. The protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, with around 100 people. They started by celebrating the Second Amendment but then focused on opposing coronavirus restrictions. They hung an effigy of Governor Beshear with a Latin phrase, which translates to "thus always to tyrants." This suggests they're viewing the governor as a tyrant, which is a strong moral statement against his policies.

Next, the backlash is significant. Both Republicans and Democrats condemned the action. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, supports the First Amendment but says the protest went too far. Others, including the Republican Secretary of State and Democratic Mayor, called it disgusting and vile, emphasizing that such actions have no place in their party or community.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral framing. So, I'll mention the protest's purpose, the effigy with the Latin phrase, and the widespread condemnation, highlighting the moral outrage from both parties.

I should structure it to first describe the protest, then the backlash, and the moral implications. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial. I'll make sure to include the key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a rally organized by Take Back Kentucky, which aimed to oppose coronavirus restrictions. The effigy featured a picture of Beshear and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies," translating to "thus always to tyrants." The protest, which began with celebrating the Second Amendment, escalated as participants marched to Beshear's home and later returned to the capitol to hang the effigy. The action sparked widespread condemnation from both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the protest, stating it went beyond acceptable free speech. Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams and Democratic Mayor Greg Fischer also condemned the act, calling it "disgusting" and "vile." Kentucky House Democrats issued a statement denouncing the protest as "beyond reprehensible." The event highlighted deep divisions over freedom of expression and opposition to pandemic restrictions. END OF SUMMARY.
