SUMMARY:

Protestors in Kentucky sparked outrage by hanging an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking a strong backlash from both parties. The protest, meant to "fight back" against coronavirus restrictions, turned into a call to action against the "shutdown" measures. The around 100 protesters marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy," before hanging the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," a Latin phrase that translates to "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was swiftly taken down, but not before it drew widespread condemnation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans denounced the "unacceptable" and "disgusting" act, calling it "hate" with no place in Kentucky. Democrats, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also condemned the "vile act," urging the importance of "protecting" the community and prioritizing "healthy" and "safe" practices. The incident was widely seen as a reprehensible "action" that went too far. END OF SUMMARY.
