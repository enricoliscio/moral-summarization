SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hanged an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a rally against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to celebrate freedom and oppose the state's shutdown measures. Around 100 people attended the rally, which began as a celebration of the Second Amendment but later turned into a march to the governor's house, shouting for him to come out. The protestors then returned to the capitol, where an effigy of Beshear with the message "sic temper tyrannies" was hanged from a tree. This act was swiftly condemned by members of both parties, including Senator Mitch McConnell and Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, who called it unacceptable and disgusting. The act was also condemned by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, who called it a "vile act" and "beyond reprehensible," respectively. The effigy was taken down shortly after it was hanged.
END OF SUMMARY.
