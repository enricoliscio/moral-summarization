SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a rally against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, initially intended to celebrate the Second Amendment but turned into a demonstration against the state's shutdown measures. Around 100 people participated in the protest, marching to the governor's house and later hanging an effigy with Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies." The effigy was quickly taken down, but the incident sparked swift backlash from both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, and Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer all condemned the action, with McConnell calling it "unacceptable" and Adams calling it "disgusting." The Kentucky House Democrats also issued a statement, calling the effigy hanging "beyond reprehensible."
END OF SUMMARY.
