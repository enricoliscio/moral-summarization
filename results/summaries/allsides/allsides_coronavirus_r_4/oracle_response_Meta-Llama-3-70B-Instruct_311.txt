SUMMARY:

Protestors in Kentucky sparked outrage by hanging an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, in a demonstration meant to "fight back" against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began with a celebration of the Second Amendment but turned into a call against the "unconstitutional shutdown" of the state. The around-100 protesters marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy," before returning to the capitol to hang the effigy, which featured a picture of Beshear's face and a message reading "sic temper tyrannies," or "thus always to tyrants." The act was widely condemned by politicians from both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it "unacceptable" and said "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also spoke out against the "vile act," emphasizing the importance of "protecting" and "honoring" the community during the pandemic.
