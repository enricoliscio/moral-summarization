SUMMARY:
A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, meant to "celebrate freedom and fight back against unconstitutional shutdowns," took a dark turn when around 100 people marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy." The effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies," was eventually taken down. The actions were deemed "unacceptable" and "disgusting" by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, respectively. Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, also condemned the "vile" and "beyond reprehensible" act, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing community health and safety over hate and divisive rhetoric.
