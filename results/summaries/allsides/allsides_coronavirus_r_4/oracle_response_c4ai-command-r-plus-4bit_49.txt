SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, in an act of protest against the coronavirus shutdown. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, started as a celebration of the Second Amendment but turned into a call against coronavirus restrictions. The effigy, with the governor's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies," was hung from a tree by several people and was quickly taken down. The act caused swift backlash from both parties, with many condemning the hanging as an unacceptable and hateful act. Senator Mitch McConnell, a strong defender of the First Amendment, stated that while peaceful protest is protected, the action toward Governor Beshear was unacceptable and had no place for hate in Kentucky. Other officials, such as Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also spoke out against the effigy, calling it reprehensible and a vile act that dishonors those who have sacrificed for our country and our health during the pandemic. The hanging of the effigy demonstrates a fight against what some see as tyrannical restrictions, but it has been widely condemned as crossing a moral line.
END OF SUMMARY.
