SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against coronavirus restrictions and hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to celebrate freedom and oppose the coronavirus shutdown. The rally, which began as a celebration of the Second Amendment, turned into a call against the governor's restrictions. Protestors marched to the governor's house and later hung an effigy with Beshear's face and a Latin phrase that translates to "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was quickly taken down, but the incident sparked swift backlash from both parties. Many condemned the protestor's actions, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said that while he supports the right to peaceful protest, the actions at the protest were unacceptable. Other officials, such as Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also spoke out against the hanging of the effigy, calling it unacceptable and a vile act. The Kentucky House Democrats issued a statement calling the incident "beyond reprehensible."
END OF SUMMARY.
