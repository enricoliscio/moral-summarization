SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky, in a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions, hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to be a celebration of freedom and a stand against what they saw as an unconstitutional shutdown. However, the rally took a disturbing turn when protestors marched to the governor's house, calling for him to come out, and later hung the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," invoking the words of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln. This act caused swift and strong backlash from members of both political parties, who condemned the protestor's actions as unacceptable, hateful, and vile. Senator Mitch McConnell, while defending the right to peaceful protest, stated that the actions towards Governor Beshear were unacceptable and had no place in Kentucky. Other officials, such as Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, also spoke out against the incident, emphasizing that such actions have no place in the Party of Lincoln and that freedom must be accompanied by a respect for science and the well-being of the community. The Kentucky House Democrats also issued a statement, calling the effigy hanging beyond reprehensible. The incident highlights the moral dilemma of balancing freedom and public health during a pandemic and the strong emotions that these restrictions can evoke.
