SUMMARY:
A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The protest, meant to "celebrate freedom" and fight against coronavirus restrictions, was denounced by politicians for its hateful and unacceptable display. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the action "unacceptable" and said there is "no place for hate in Kentucky." Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams tweeted that the act was "disgusting" and reminiscent of John Wilkes Booth's words. Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer condemned the "vile act" on Memorial Day weekend, emphasizing the importance of sharing science and keeping each other healthy and safe. Kentucky House Democrats also issued a statement calling the effigy "beyond reprehensible." The effigy was eventually taken down, but not before it sparked outrage and calls for civility.
