SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky, in an appalling display of disrespect and moral depravity, hung an effigy of Governor Andy Beshear during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, started as a celebration of the Second Amendment but quickly devolved into a call against the state's efforts to protect its citizens from the deadly virus. Chants of "Come out Andy" and the hanging of the effigy with a message reading "sic temper tyrannis" revealed the true intent of the protestors: to threaten and intimidate a democratically elected official. The actions of these protestors are reprehensible and unacceptable. Senator Mitch McConnell and many others swiftly and rightfully condemned the actions, with McConnell stating that "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." This incident underscores the importance of upholding moral values and respecting the rule of law, even in times of crisis. The protestors' actions are a blight on the values of freedom and democracy that they claim to defend.
END OF SUMMARY.
