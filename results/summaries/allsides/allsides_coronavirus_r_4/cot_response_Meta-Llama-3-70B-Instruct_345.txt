SUMMARY:
A protest in Kentucky turned ugly when demonstrators hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, sparking widespread condemnation from both parties. The rally, meant to "celebrate freedom and fight back against unconstitutional shutdowns," took a dark turn when protesters marched to the governor's house and later hung the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies," or "thus always to tyrants." The act was swiftly denounced by politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who called it "unacceptable" and said "there is no place for hate in Kentucky." Others, including Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, labeled the act "disgusting" and "vile." Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted that the act was "beyond reprehensible" and urged the importance of sharing science and keeping each other healthy and safe. The effigy was eventually taken down, but not before causing a stir that highlighted the dangers of hate and intolerance. END OF SUMMARY.
