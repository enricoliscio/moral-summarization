Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: fight, shutdown, hanging, actions, action, hate, honor, protect, act, healthy, safe, effigy. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Beshear, opposing coronavirus restrictions. The event started as a Second Amendment celebration but turned into抗议 against shutdowns. They marched to his house, then returned to hang the effigy with the Latin phrase. The action caused backlash from both parties, including McConnell, who condemned it despite supporting free speech. Others called it hate and disgusting, linking it to Booth, and emphasized unity and health.

I'll structure the summary to include the key moral terms. Start with the protest against the shutdown, mention the effigy hanging, and the moral condemnation. Highlight McConnell's stance on free speech but against hate. Include Fischer's emphasis on health and safety leading to freedom. Also, mention the inappropriate comparison to Booth and the need to honor sacrifices.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral words where appropriate. For example, "protesters hung an effigy" uses 'hanging' and 'effigy'. "Fought against the shutdown" uses 'fight' and'shutdown'. McConnell's statement uses 'unacceptable' and 'hate'. Fischer's part uses 'healthy','safe', 'freedom'.

I should also ensure the flow is logical, starting with the protest, their actions, the backlash, and the moral implications. Make sure each sentence transitions smoothly, maintaining the moral framing throughout.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and the moral words are appropriately included without making it sound forced. Check for any unnecessary words to keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear, part of a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions they deemed unconstitutional. The rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began celebrating the Second Amendment but escalated into a call to "fight" the shutdown. Protesters marched to Beshear's home, chanting "Come out Andy," before returning to the capitol to hang the effigy, which bore the phrase "sic temper tyrannies." The action sparked widespread condemnation, with Sen. Mitch McConnell calling it "unacceptable" and "hate-filled," despite supporting free speech. Others, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, criticized the "vile act," emphasizing the need to "protect" public health and "honor" sacrifices made during the pandemic. The effigy's hanging was widely condemned as "disgusting" and "beyond reprehensible," with many highlighting the importance of unity and "healthy" measures to ensure "safety." END OF SUMMARY.
