SUMMARY:
Protestors in Kentucky expressed their anger towards Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The demonstration, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was intended to celebrate freedom and challenge the alleged unconstitutional shutdowns implemented due to the coronavirus pandemic. The initially pro-Second Amendment rally took a turn when protestors marched to the governor's house, demanding his presence. They eventually returned to the capitol, where an effigy with Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannis" (translating to "thus always to tyrants") was hung from a tree by several participants. This act of unacceptable hate was swiftly condemned by members of both political parties. Many deemed the act vile and reprehensible, especially as it occurred during Memorial Day weekend, a time to honor sacrifices made for freedom and to protect our community. The incident sparked outrage and prompted a strong rejection of such actions, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asserting that "there is no place for hate in Kentucky."
