SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky demonstrated against the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear by hanging an effigy of him outside the state capitol. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was meant to fight against what they saw as unconstitutional shutdowns over the coronavirus. While the rally initially celebrated the Second Amendment, it soon turned into a call against coronavirus restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting threats, and later hung the effigy with a message that read "sic temper tyrannies." This act caused widespread backlash, with members of both parties condemning the protestors' actions as unacceptable and hateful. Many saw the effigy hanging as a disgusting and beyond reprehensible act, especially on Memorial Day weekend when honoring those who gave their lives for the country. The swift condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum highlights the importance of protecting freedom while keeping the community safe during a pandemic.
END OF SUMMARY.
