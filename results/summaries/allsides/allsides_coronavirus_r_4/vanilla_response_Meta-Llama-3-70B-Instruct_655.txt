SUMMARY:

Protesters in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration on Sunday. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, aimed to "celebrate freedom and fight back against unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus." Around 100 people attended, initially celebrating the Second Amendment before turning their attention to opposing coronavirus restrictions. They marched to the governor's house and later returned to the capitol, where they hung the effigy with a picture of Beshear's face and a message reading "sic temper tyrannies" (Latin for "thus always to tyrants"). The effigy was taken down shortly after. The action sparked swift backlash from both parties, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, and Kentucky House Democrats condemning the effigy as "unacceptable," "disgusting," and "beyond reprehensible."

END OF SUMMARY.
