SUMMARY:

Protesters in Kentucky sparked outrage by hanging an effigy of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear outside the state capitol, condemning his "unconstitutional shutdown" over the coronavirus. The rally, meant to "celebrate freedom" and "fight back" against restrictions, turned into a call to action against the governor's measures. Protesters marched to the governor's house, shouting "Come out Andy," and later hung the effigy, bearing a picture of Beshear's face and the message "sic temper tyrannies" (thus always to tyrants). The act was swiftly condemned by members of both parties, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it "unacceptable" and "hate" with no place in Kentucky. Others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, echoed the sentiment, urging the importance of honoring those who gave their lives for the country and protecting the community from the pandemic.
