Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about a protest in Kentucky where protestors hung an effigy of Governor Beshear. The protest was organized by Take Back Kentucky, aiming to celebrate freedom and oppose coronavirus shutdowns. They started by supporting the Second Amendment, then shifted to opposing pandemic restrictions. They marched to the governor's house and later hung the effigy with the Latin phrase "sic temper tyrannies," meaning "thus always to tyrants." The effigy was taken down quickly. There was backlash from both parties, with McConnell and others condemning the action as unacceptable, hate-filled, and dishonoring.

The author used words like fight, shutdown, hanging, actions, hate, honor, protect, healthy, safe, effigy. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to include the protest details, the moral framing words, and the reactions. I'll start by mentioning the protest, the effigy, the message, and the reasons behind it. Then, I'll note the backlash, using words like unacceptable, hate, honor, and the consequences of their actions.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll make sure to include the moral terms and the key reactions from McConnell and others.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring all important points are covered and the moral language is preserved.
