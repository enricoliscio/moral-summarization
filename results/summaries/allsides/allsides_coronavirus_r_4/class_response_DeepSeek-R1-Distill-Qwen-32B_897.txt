Okay, I need to summarize the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Governor Beshear, opposing coronavirus restrictions. They celebrated the Second Amendment and then focused on fighting the shutdown. They marched, shouted, and hung the effigy with a message. There was backlash from both parties, with McConnell and others condemning the actions as unacceptable, hate-filled, and disgusting.

I need to include words like "fight," "shutdown," "marched," "shouting," "hanging," "effigy," "protest," "unacceptable," "hate," "disgusting," "protect," "safe," "freedom," and "beyond." I should structure the summary to flow naturally, starting with the protest, their actions, the backlash, and the moral condemnation.

I'll start by stating the protest's purpose and actions, then move to the backlash, making sure to include the moral terms. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it: Protestors in Kentucky fought against the coronavirus shutdown by marching and shouting during a rally, eventually hanging an effigy of Governor Beshear. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, celebrated the Second Amendment but turned into opposition against pandemic restrictions. The effigy, with a message denouncing tyranny, sparked widespread condemnation. Both parties criticized the act, calling it unacceptable, filled with hate, and disgusting. Leaders emphasized the importance of protecting the community and promoting freedom through safety measures. The protest was widely condemned as beyond reproach.

I should check if I included all the moral terms. I used "fight," "shutdown," "marched," "shouting," "hanging," "effigy," "protest," "unacceptable," "hate," "disgusting," "protect," "safe" (implied in "protecting the community"), "freedom," and "beyond." It seems comprehensive. I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit.
