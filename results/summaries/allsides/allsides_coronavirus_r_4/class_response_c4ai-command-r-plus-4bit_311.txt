SUMMARY: Protestors in Kentucky took to the streets to fight against what they saw as an unconstitutional shutdown over the coronavirus, but their actions soon turned unacceptable. The initially peaceful rally, organized by Take Back Kentucky, began with a celebration of the Second Amendment but later turned into a march on the governor's house, with protestors shouting at Gov. Andy Beshear. The demonstration, meant to protect freedom, took a dark turn when an effigy of the governor was hung from a tree outside the state capitol. This act of hate was met with swift backlash from both parties, with many condemning the protestors' actions as disgusting and beyond reprehensible. The effigy, bearing the governor's face and a message denouncing tyranny, was taken down shortly after. While some may argue that the protest was an exercise of their freedom to demonstrate, the hanging of an effigy crosses a line, and the backlash demonstrates a collective understanding that such acts of intimidation have no place in civil discourse. 

END OF SUMMARY.
