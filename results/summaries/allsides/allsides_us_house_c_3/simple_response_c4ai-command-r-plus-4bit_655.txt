SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged obstruction of justice in the Russia probe. This marks the third subpoena issued by the committee in two weeks as part of its impeachment inquiry into Trump's presidency. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that Porter was involved in key episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to fire Mueller and coerce McGahn into lying about it. Democrats also seek testimony from Lewandowski and Dearborn regarding Trump's pressure on Sessions to redirect the Russia investigation. Nadler emphasized that no one is above the law, highlighting the importance of holding the president accountable for his actions. According to the Mueller report, Porter understood Trump's intentions to end the Russia probe or fire Mueller, despite the president's implicit instructions. Porter's role in these incidents and his firsthand accounts are crucial to the investigation. His testimony will provide valuable insights into the moral and legal implications of the Trump administration's actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
