Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying moral implications.

The article talks about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. It mentions that this is part of an investigation that could lead to impeachment. The key moral issue here is obstruction of justice and whether Trump is above the law.

I should note that the committee is focusing on Trump's actions as described in the Mueller report, specifically his attempts to get McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. This shows a pattern of behavior that could be seen as unethical and against the rule of law.

Also, the article mentions that other advisers are being subpoenaed, and the Democrats are using this to build a case for impeachment. The moral framing is clear: Trump's actions are being scrutinized for potential wrongdoing, and the Democrats are emphasizing that no one is above the law.

I need to make sure the summary captures the subpoena, the purpose behind it, the key figures involved, and the moral implications of Trump's actions. It's important to highlight that the Democrats are using this to determine impeachment, which is a serious moral and legal step.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well. I'll start by stating the subpoena, mention the key points from the Mueller report, and conclude with the committee's intent to investigate impeachment. I'll make sure to include that Trump's actions are seen as obstructing justice and that the Democrats are emphasizing accountability.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the subpoena, mention the purpose (Trump's alleged obstruction), reference the Mueller report details, note the other subpoenaed individuals, and conclude with the committee's intent. I should also include that the Democrats argue Trump's actions warrant prosecution, which ties into the moral framing of accountability.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the necessary elements with the correct moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This is part of an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment. Porter, who was featured prominently in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, is expected to discuss Trump's attempts to pressure former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Democrats argue that Trump's actions, as detailed in the Mueller report, demonstrate obstruction of justice and warrant accountability, stating that "no one is above the law." The committee is also seeking testimony from Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn to further examine Trump's alleged efforts to influence the Russia investigation. Porter's involvement in these events, including Trump's pressure tactics, highlights the moral and legal implications of the president's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
