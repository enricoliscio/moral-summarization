SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's immoral and illegal efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation. This is the third subpoena issued by the Committee in two weeks as part of their investigation into the Trump presidency and potential impeachment proceedings.

Porter was a key witness to several episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to fire the special counsel and his pressure on then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to lie about it. The Committee also seeks to question Porter about Trump's efforts to replace then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would end the Russia investigation.

According to the Mueller report, Trump disparaged McGahn and considered firing him for not carrying out his orders. The report also reveals that Trump asked Porter to contact a potential replacement for Sessions, indicating his immoral desire to obstruct the investigation. Despite his immoral conduct, Trump has not been prosecuted, while Porter, who resigned amid domestic abuse allegations, could now face legal consequences for his involvement in these matters.

END OF SUMMARY.
