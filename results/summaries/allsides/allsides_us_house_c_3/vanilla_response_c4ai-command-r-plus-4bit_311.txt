SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice during the Russia probe. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to be subpoenaed in recent weeks, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking information on Trump's efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Don McGahn to influence the investigation. According to the Mueller report, Porter witnessed and took notes on key episodes, including Trump's instruction to McGahn to fire the special counsel and his attempt to replace Sessions with someone who would end the Russia probe. Porter also understood Trump's request to reach out to Rachel Brand as an attempt to find someone to fire the special counsel. Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that the proceedings will help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. The White House has previously blocked testimony from other former aides, and it is unclear if they will do so again.

END OF SUMMARY.
