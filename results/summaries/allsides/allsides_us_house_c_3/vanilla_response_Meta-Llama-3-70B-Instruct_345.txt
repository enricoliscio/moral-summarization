SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to be subpoenaed in two weeks, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. They are scheduled to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter witnessed several episodes outlined in the Mueller report, including Trump's efforts to obstruct justice by directing Don McGahn to fire the special counsel. Democrats want to question Porter about these incidents, as well as Trump's alleged efforts to pressure Jeff Sessions to direct the Russia investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
