Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice regarding the Russian interference probe. It mentions that this is the third subpoena in two weeks, with the others being Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is looking into whether to recommend impeachment.

The key points here are the subpoenas, the focus on obstruction of justice, and the specific instances involving Don McGahn and Jeff Sessions. The article also highlights that Democrats believe the evidence against Trump is strong enough for prosecution, which adds a moral angle about accountability.

I should make sure to include that Porter was involved in key events from the Mueller report, like Trump pressuring McGahn to fire Mueller and then lie about it. Also, Trump's attempt to get rid of McGahn if he didn't comply and the reference to Porter's domestic abuse history, which adds context but might not be central to the moral framing.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. I'll structure it by mentioning the subpoenas, the purpose of the testimony, the key individuals involved, and the moral implications of accountability. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and to the point.

Let me draft it now, making sure to capture all these elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice during the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This is the third subpoena issued to former Trump advisers in two weeks, with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn also set to testify. The committee aims to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter, a key figure in the Mueller report, was involved in episodes where Trump allegedly pressured former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Democrats argue that Trump's actions, as detailed in the Mueller report, warrant accountability, stating that "no one is above the law." Porter's testimony could shed light on Trump's alleged attempts to influence the investigation, including pressuring McGahn and considering replacements for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The moral framing underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring accountability for potential wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
