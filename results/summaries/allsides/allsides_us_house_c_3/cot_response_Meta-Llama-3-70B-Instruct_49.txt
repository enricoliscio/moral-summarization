SUMMARY:
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a former White House staff secretary, witnessed episodes laid out in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, including Trump's efforts to obstruct justice by directing Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view this as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency, and Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that "no one is above the law" and that "any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report." Porter's testimony is crucial to determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. END OF SUMMARY.
