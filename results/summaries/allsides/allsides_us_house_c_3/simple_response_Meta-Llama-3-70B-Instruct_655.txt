SUMMARY:

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, is scheduled to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump's actions constitute obstruction of justice, and Porter's testimony is crucial as he witnessed several key episodes, including Trump's attempts to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the investigation away from the Trump campaign. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the Mueller report. The committee's goal is to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives.

END OF SUMMARY.
