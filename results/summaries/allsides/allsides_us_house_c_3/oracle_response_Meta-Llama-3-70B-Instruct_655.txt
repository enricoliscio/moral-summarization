SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a former White House staff secretary, witnessed episodes laid out in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempts to direct Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view this as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency. Porter is also expected to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, stated that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the Mueller report. Porter's testimony is crucial in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. END OF SUMMARY.
