Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications highlighted in the text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter, Corey Lewandowski, and Rick Dearborn. They're being called to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct the Russian interference investigation. The key morally charged words used are things like interference, obstruct, directing, fire, lie, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article mentions that Democrats are looking into whether Trump tried to impede the probe, which ties into the moral framing of obstruction of justice. Porter's role in this is significant because he was involved in conversations where Trump allegedly tried to get rid of the special counsel and then lie about it. Also, the fact that Porter left the White House after domestic abuse allegations adds another layer of moral judgment.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's actions as obstructing justice, using the specific terms from the article. I'll also mention the subpoenas and the purpose of the testimony, which is to determine if impeachment is warranted. Including the part about the Democrats' view that Trump's actions warrant prosecution adds the moral weight.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points: the subpoenas, the purpose of the testimony, the key incidents involving Porter, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible without making it sound forced.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, maintaining the moral tone as the author intended.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice by impeding a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, is set to appear before the committee on Sept. 17. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that the proceedings aim to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter, who witnessed key episodes detailed in the Mueller report, was involved in Trump's alleged directive to former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. Democrats argue that Trump's actions, including pressuring then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to divert the investigation, warrant prosecution. Porter also reportedly helped Trump pressure McGahn and considered replacing Sessions with someone who would end the probe. Porter left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse allegations. The subpoenas highlight the moral framing of Trump's alleged interference, obstruction, and attempts to cover up his actions. END OF SUMMARY.
