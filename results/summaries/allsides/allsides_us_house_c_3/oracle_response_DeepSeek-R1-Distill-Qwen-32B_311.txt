Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words they've highlighted, which are all morally charged terms. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter and others to testify about Trump's alleged interference in the Russia probe. The key moral elements are obstruction, lying, firing, directing, etc. I should make sure to include these words in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying the main events: the subpoena, the involvement of other advisers, the purpose of the investigation, and the specific actions Trump is accused of. I'll need to mention the Mueller report and how it ties into the current proceedings. Also, the fact that Porter left due to domestic abuse allegations adds another moral dimension. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the subpoena, then the purpose, the key individuals involved, and the specific accusations against Trump. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words as much as possible without making it sound forced. Finally, I'll conclude with the potential outcome, like impeachment, and mention the White House's possible response. 

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly while preserving the moral language. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure it flows naturally.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Trump to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, is set to appear before the committee on Sept. 17. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated the proceedings aim to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter, who witnessed key episodes detailed in the Mueller report, is central to Democrats' investigation of Trump's alleged attempts to direct former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Democrats also seek testimony on Trump's alleged pressure on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to divert the Russia investigation. Nadler emphasized that Trump's actions, based on Mueller's findings, would warrant prosecution for any other American. Porter's involvement in Trump's efforts to pressure McGahn and find a replacement for Sessions, as detailed in the Mueller report, highlights the moral framing of obstruction, lying, and interference. Porter left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
