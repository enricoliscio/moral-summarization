SUMMARY:
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, who witnessed several key episodes, including Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by directing White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view this as a key piece of evidence in their investigation of the Trump presidency. As Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said, "No one is above the law" and "any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report." Porter's testimony is crucial in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives.
