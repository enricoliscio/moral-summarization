Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. 

First, I should identify the key points. The committee is looking into whether Trump obstructed justice, which is a serious charge. They've subpoenaed Porter and others, and the goal is to determine if impeachment is warranted. The article mentions Mueller's report, where Trump tried to get McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. Porter was involved in pressuring McGahn, and Trump even referred to McGahn as a "lying bastard." There's also the part about Trump wanting someone to end the Russia investigation, possibly by replacing Sessions. Porter took notes on these incidents, which are important for the Democrats' case. 

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral issues, like obstruction of justice and the potential for impeachment. The author is framing this as a serious legal and moral issue, so the summary should reflect that. I'll keep it under 200 words, starting with the subpoena, mentioning the key figures and their roles, the Mueller report details, and the implications for impeachment. I'll end with the moral statement about accountability. 

Let me structure it: Start with the subpoena, mention the purpose (investigate obstruction, impeachment), detail Trump's actions through Mueller's report, include Porter's role, and conclude with the committee's stance on accountability. Make sure it's concise but covers all necessary points without being too lengthy. 

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, but the moral framing is inherent in the context of obstruction and potential impeachment. So the summary should naturally include the moral implications without explicitly stating them beyond the facts.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to obstruct the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This is part of the committee's investigation to determine if Trump should be impeached. Porter, along with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, is set to appear before the committee on September 17. The Democrats are focusing on Trump's alleged attempts to pressure former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to halt the Russia investigation and his efforts to have former Special Counsel Robert Mueller fired. According to the Mueller report, Trump instructed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller and then lie about it, and Porter played a role in pressuring McGahn. Trump also sought to replace Sessions with someone who would end the investigation. Democrats argue that Trump's actions warrant accountability, stating that "no one is above the law." END OF SUMMARY.
