Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former Trump aide, to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference investigation. The moral framing here seems to be about obstruction of justice and accountability.

I should note that Porter is one of three subpoenaed, along with Lewandowski and Dearborn. Their testimony is part of the committee's investigation into whether to recommend impeachment. The key points are Porter's involvement in incidents described by Mueller, including Trump's pressure on McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Also, Trump's attempt to replace Sessions with Brand to end the investigation.

I need to highlight the moral implications, such as Trump being above the law and the potential obstruction of justice. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main events and the committee's intentions. I'll make sure to mention the subpoena, the purpose of the testimony, the relevant Mueller findings, and the implications for impeachment.

I should structure the summary to first mention the subpoena, then the context of the investigation, followed by the specific incidents involving Porter, and conclude with the committee's aim. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts while keeping the moral tone intact.

Let me draft this, making sure to cover all the essential points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check for clarity and ensure that the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the potential obstruction and the committee's pursuit of justice.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice by impeding the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, is set to appear before the committee on Sept. 17. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that the proceedings aim to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter is central to the investigation, as he witnessed key episodes detailed in Robert Mueller's report, including Trump's pressure on White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Democrats argue that Trump's actions, as outlined in the Mueller report, amount to obstruction of justice, and no one should be above the law. Porter's role in Trump's alleged attempts to pressure McGahn and replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would end the investigation further underscores the moral and legal implications of Trump's actions. The committee's focus highlights the ongoing debate over accountability and justice in the context of the Mueller findings. END OF SUMMARY.
