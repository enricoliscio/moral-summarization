Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. Porter is the third former Trump adviser subpoenaed recently, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. They are set to appear on September 17.

Chairman Jerrold Nadler says this testimony will help determine if Trump should be impeached. Porter was a key figure in Mueller's report, especially regarding Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by directing Don McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Democrats want to focus on Trump's pressure on Jeff Sessions to divert the investigation away from his campaign.

Nadler mentions that Trump's actions would warrant prosecution if done by anyone else. Porter's involvement includes Trump pressuring McGahn and considering replacing Sessions. Porter left the White House in 2018 due to domestic abuse allegations.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY. I'll focus on the subpoena, the key figures, the purpose of the testimony, and the main points from Mueller's report. I'll make sure to mention the potential for impeachment and the context of Trump's actions.

Let me structure it: start with the subpoena, mention the other advisers, the purpose of the hearing, key points from Mueller's report, and the implications for impeachment. Keep it concise, ensuring all main elements are included without going over the word limit.
