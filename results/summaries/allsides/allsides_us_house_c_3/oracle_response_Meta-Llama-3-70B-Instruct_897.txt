SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a former White House staff secretary, witnessed several episodes of Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, including directing Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view these incidents as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency. Porter's testimony is crucial in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. The committee is also seeking testimony from Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, who are involved in another damaging episode of Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct Mueller's investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign. As Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated, "No one is above the law," and Trump's actions would have led to prosecution for any other American. END OF SUMMARY.
