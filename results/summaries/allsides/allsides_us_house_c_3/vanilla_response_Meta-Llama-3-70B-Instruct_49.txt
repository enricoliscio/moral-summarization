SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, are scheduled to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view Porter's testimony as key to their investigation, as he witnessed several episodes laid out in Mueller's report. Porter's testimony could shed light on Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct Mueller's investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
