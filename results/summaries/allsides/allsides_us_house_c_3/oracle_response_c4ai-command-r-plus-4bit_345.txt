SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed in recent weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking information on incidents described in the Mueller report that suggest Trump may have obstructed justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordering him to lie about it. According to the report, Trump also asked Porter to pressure McGahn into denying the incident and to find a replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe. Porter is said to have understood that Trump wanted someone who would end the investigation or fire the special counsel. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, stated that the proceedings will help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment, emphasizing that no one is above the law. Porter, who left the White House amid accusations of domestic abuse, could provide key testimony due to his proximity to many of the incidents in question.
END OF SUMMARY.
