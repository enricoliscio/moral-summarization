SUMMARY: 
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former Trump aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Trump to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed by the committee in the past two weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The hearings are part of the Democratic-led panel's investigation to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter witnessed several episodes described in the Mueller report, including an incident where Trump allegedly tried to get then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then asked him to lie about it. Democrats also want to question Lewandowski and Dearborn about another damaging episode where Trump allegedly tried to pressure the Attorney General to direct the Russia investigation away from his campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump implicated Porter in trying to pressure McGahn into denying the incident, even calling him a "lying bastard." Porter also understood Trump to want him to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the special counsel. Porter left the White House in 2018 following allegations of domestic abuse. The White House has yet to respond to the subpoenas for Porter and Dearborn. Lewandowski, who has never served on the White House staff, has agreed to testify.
END OF SUMMARY.
