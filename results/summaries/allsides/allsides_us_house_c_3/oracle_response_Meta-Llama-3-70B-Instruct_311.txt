SUMMARY:

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a key witness in the Russia investigation, is expected to testify about Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view this episode as crucial to their investigation of the Trump presidency. Porter is also expected to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the Russia investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the Mueller report. Porter's testimony is crucial in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives.
