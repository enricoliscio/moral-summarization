SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct the Russia probe. This marks the third subpoena issued by the committee in two weeks as part of its investigation into potential impeachment charges against Trump.

Porter was a witness to several key episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to have then-White House Counsel Don McGahn fire the special counsel and then cover it up. The committee is also interested in Porter's notes on other incidents and his understanding of Trump's intentions regarding the Russia investigation.

The White House has previously sought to block testimony from former aides, and it remains to be seen if they will do the same for Porter and Dearborn. Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant, has indicated he will testify. The committee's proceedings are aimed at determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House. The chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that "no one is above the law," highlighting the seriousness of the alleged offenses. 

END OF SUMMARY.
