Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It mentions that this is the third subpoena for a former Trump adviser in two weeks, with the others being Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. They are all set to appear on September 17.

The chairman, Jerrold Nadler, says this is to help determine if they should recommend impeachment. Porter was involved in episodes detailed in the Mueller report, including an incident where Trump tried to get Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Democrats see this as key to their investigation.

The article also mentions that Democrats want Lewandowski and Dearborn to testify about Trump pressuring Jeff Sessions to redirect the Mueller investigation. Nadler states that based on Mueller's findings, Trump should be prosecuted, but no one is above the law.

Porter's role is significant because he was involved in Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, including Trump telling him to get rid of McGahn if he didn't write a denial letter. Porter also interacted with Rachel Brand regarding replacing Sessions.

Porter left the White House in 2018 after domestic abuse accusations. It's unclear if the White House will block his testimony, but Lewandowski has agreed to testify.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the subpoena, who else is involved, the purpose (impeachment consideration), Porter's role in the Mueller report, the specific incidents (McGahn and Brand), and the potential implications.

I should structure it to start with the subpoena, mention the others subpoenaed, the purpose, and then detail the specific incidents involving Porter and Trump's actions. Also, note that Porter's testimony is crucial and that the White House's stance is unknown, while Lewandowski will testify.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all the essential elements without going into too much detail. Let me try to draft it step by step, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows logically.

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This is the third subpoena for a former Trump adviser in two weeks, with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn also subpoenaed. The hearing on September 17 aims to determine if impeachment proceedings against Trump are warranted. Porter, featured prominently in the Mueller report, was involved in incidents where Trump allegedly pressured former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Democrats seek testimony on Trump's efforts to influence the Russia investigation, including pressuring Jeff Sessions. Porter's role in Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, such as Trump's instruction to remove McGahn if he refused to deny the orders, is key. Porter also interacted with Rachel Brand regarding replacing Sessions. His testimony, along with Lewandowski's, is crucial, though the White House's stance on blocking testimony remains unclear. Porter left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse allegations.
