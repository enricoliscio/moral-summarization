SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, is scheduled to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Porter witnessed several episodes laid out in Mueller's report, including Trump's efforts to pressure McGahn and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Democrats want to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter's testimony could be crucial in the investigation, as he took contemporaneous notes during several incidents that interest Democrats.
