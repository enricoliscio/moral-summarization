SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a key witness in the Mueller report, is expected to testify about Trump's attempts to direct White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats believe this episode is crucial to their investigation of the Trump presidency. The committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the Mueller report. The subpoena is part of the committee's inquiry into whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives.
