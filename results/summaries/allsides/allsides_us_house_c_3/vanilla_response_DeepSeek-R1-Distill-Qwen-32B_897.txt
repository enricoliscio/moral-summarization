Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to receive a subpoena in the past two weeks, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. They are set to appear on September 17.

The purpose of this testimony, according to Chairman Jerrold Nadler, is to help the committee determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter was involved in key episodes mentioned in Robert Mueller's report, especially regarding Trump's attempt to obstruct justice by directing Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. Democrats are focusing on these events to investigate Trump.

The article also mentions that Democrats want Lewandowski and Dearborn to testify about Trump pressuring Jeff Sessions to redirect the Mueller investigation away from the Trump campaign. Nadler emphasized that Trump's actions would warrant prosecution for any other American, based on Mueller's findings.

Porter's role included being pressured by Trump to get McGahn to deny the instructions publicly. Trump even considered replacing Sessions with someone who would end the investigation, like Rachel Brand, whom Porter knew. Porter left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse allegations.

So, the key points are: subpoena of Porter and others, testimony purpose for impeachment consideration, Mueller's findings on obstruction, Trump's pressure on McGahn and Sessions, and Porter's involvement in these events.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the subpoena, the purpose, the key individuals involved, and the main allegations from Mueller's report.
