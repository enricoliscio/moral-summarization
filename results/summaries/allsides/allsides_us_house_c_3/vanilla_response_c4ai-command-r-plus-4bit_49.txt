SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation. Porter is a key witness to several episodes detailed in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to have former White House Counsel Don McGahn fire Mueller and then cover it up. Democrats also seek testimony from Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn about Trump's pressure on Jeff Sessions to direct the Russia probe away from his campaign. The hearings will help determine if the committee recommends Trump's impeachment. Porter could provide insight into Trump's attempts to find a replacement for Sessions after his recusal from the Russia probe. He took notes on other incidents of interest and left the White House amid domestic abuse allegations. The White House has blocked testimony from other aides, but it is unclear if they will do so for Porter and Dearborn. Lewandowski has said he will testify.
