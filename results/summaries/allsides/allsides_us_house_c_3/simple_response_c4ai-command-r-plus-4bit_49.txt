SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice in the Russia probe. Porter witnessed key episodes, including Trump's attempt to fire the special counsel and pressure Attorney General Sessions to direct the investigation away from his campaign. Chairman Jerrold Nadler seeks to determine if Trump's impeachment is warranted. Porter could provide insight into Trump's efforts to obstruct justice and find a replacement for Sessions to end the Russia probe. The committee also subpoenaed Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, as Trump's White House continues to impede investigations. The president's immoral conduct, as described in the Mueller report, indicates a pattern of abuse of power and disregard for the law. The investigation seeks to uphold the moral principle that no one is above the law.
END OF SUMMARY.
