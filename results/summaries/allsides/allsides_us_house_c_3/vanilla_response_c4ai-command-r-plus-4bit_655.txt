SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice in the Russia probe. Porter is the third ex-Trump adviser subpoenaed by the committee in two weeks, joining Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The hearings are part of the committee's investigation into whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter witnessed key episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to fire Mueller and pressure then-AG Jeff Sessions to direct the Russia probe away from the campaign. According to the report, Trump asked Porter to pressure then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to deny that Trump instructed him to fire Mueller. Porter also understood Trump wanted to find a replacement for Sessions who would end the Russia investigation. Porter's testimony could provide valuable insights into Trump's actions. The White House may seek to block Porter's testimony, as it has with other former aides. The hearings are set for Sept. 17.
END OF SUMMARY.
