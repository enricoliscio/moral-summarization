SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, Corey Lewandowski, and Rick Dearborn were all ordered to appear before the committee on September 17. Jerrold Nadler, the committee chairman, stated that the proceedings would help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter witnessed several episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to pressure Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then cover it up. According to the report, Porter also understood Trump's desire to find a replacement for Jeff Sessions who would end the Russia investigation. Porter was interviewed by the special counsel team and took notes during incidents of interest to Democrats. He left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse accusations. The White House has blocked testimony from other aides, and it is unclear if they will do the same for Porter and Dearborn. Lewandowski has stated he will testify.
END OF SUMMARY.
