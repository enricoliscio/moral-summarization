SUMMARY:
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice and impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, who witnessed several episodes described in the Mueller report, is expected to testify about Trump's attempts to direct White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordering him to lie about it. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the report. The committee aims to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter's testimony is crucial in uncovering the truth about Trump's alleged damaging and lying behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
