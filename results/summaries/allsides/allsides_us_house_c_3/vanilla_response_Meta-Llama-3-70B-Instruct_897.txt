SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, are due to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice and is considering recommending his impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter was a key witness in the Russia investigation report, including an episode where Trump allegedly directed then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordered him to lie about it. Democrats want to hear from Porter and the other two advisers about Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
