SUMMARY:

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, is due to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view Porter's testimony as key to their investigation, as he witnessed several episodes laid out in Mueller's report. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler emphasized that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in Mueller's report. The committee is seeking to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives.

END OF SUMMARY.
