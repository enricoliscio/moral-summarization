SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed in recent weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking information about potential obstruction of justice by Trump, including his efforts to direct the firing of the special counsel and ordering his White House counsel, Don McGahn, to lie about it. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure McGahn into denying that he had been instructed to remove the special counsel. The report also states that Trump wanted Porter to find a replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions after he recused himself from the Russia probe, suggesting that Porter was to find someone who would end the investigation. Porter's testimony is seen as key to the committee's investigation, as he witnessed and took notes on several episodes of potential obstruction. The White House has previously sought to block testimony from other former aides, and it remains to be seen whether they will attempt to do so again. 

END OF SUMMARY.
