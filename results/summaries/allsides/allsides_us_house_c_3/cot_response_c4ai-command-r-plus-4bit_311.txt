SUMMARY:
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts to impede a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruct justice. Porter witnessed several episodes laid out in the Mueller report, including one involving then-White House Counsel Don McGahn, that Democrats view as key to their investigation of President Trump's presidency. The committee is seeking to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment, with Chairman Jerrold Nadler stating that "no one is above the law." Porter is believed to have knowledge of Trump's attempts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the Russia investigation away from the 2016 Trump campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure McGahn into writing a letter of denial and sought his help in finding a replacement for Sessions after he recused himself from the Russia probe. Porter also took contemporaneous notes during other incidents of interest. He left the White House in 2018 following accusations of domestic abuse.
END OF SUMMARY.
