SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, who witnessed several episodes of Trump's attempts to impede the investigation, is expected to testify about the President's directives to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view Porter's testimony as crucial in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter's testimony will also shed light on Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to direct the investigation away from his 2016 campaign. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that "no one is above the law" and that Trump's actions, if committed by any other American, would have led to prosecution. END OF SUMMARY.
