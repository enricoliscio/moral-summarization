Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The article is about the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter and others to testify about Trump's efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. I should highlight the key points: the subpoenas, the involvement of other advisers, the Mueller report details, and the moral implications like obstruction, lying, and domestic abuse.

First, I'll start by stating that the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter. Then mention that he's the third former Trump adviser subpoenaed. Next, explain why: to investigate Trump's efforts to impede the probe. I should include words like "interference," "obstruct," "directing," "fire," "ordering," "lie," etc. I'll note that the committee aims to determine if impeachment is warranted.

Then, I'll reference the Mueller report, highlighting how Trump tried to get McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Include the quote from Nadler about the evidence and the implication that Trump is not above the law. Mention Lewandowski and Dearborn testifying about Trump's pressure on Sessions. Also, note that Porter was involved in pressuring McGahn and the mention of domestic abuse allegations.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll structure it by first introducing the subpoenas, then the purpose, the key events from the Mueller report, and the moral implications. I'll also include the fact that Porter left the White House due to domestic abuse accusations to tie in that moral aspect.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within limits. I should use the morally framed words where appropriate without making it sound forced. Make sure each sentence connects the events with the moral framing, such as "efforts to obstruct," "ordering him to lie," etc.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral tone the author intended. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, the third former Trump adviser subpoenaed, is expected to appear alongside Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn on Sept. 17. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated the proceedings aim to determine if Trump should be impeached, highlighting Porter's role in key episodes from the Mueller report, including Trump's attempts to direct White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Democrats also seek testimony on Trump's alleged pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to divert the Russia investigation. Nadler emphasized that Trump is "no exception to the law," referencing Mueller's findings. Porter, who left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse allegations, is expected to provide details on Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, including asking McGahn to deny orders to remove the special counsel and considering replacements to end the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
