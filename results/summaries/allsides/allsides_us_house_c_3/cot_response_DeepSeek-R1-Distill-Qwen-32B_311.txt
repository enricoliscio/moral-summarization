Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. They're looking into whether Trump obstructed justice by trying to get Robert Mueller fired and then lying about it. 

I should identify the morally charged words first. Words like "subpoenaed," "impede," "obstruct," "pressure," "prosecuted," "abuse," "dishonesty," "corruption," "accountability," and "justice" stand out as they carry moral implications.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating the subpoena and the reason behind it. Then mention the other advisers subpoenaed, the purpose of their testimony, and the key points from the Mueller report. I should also include Nadler's statement about the law and the implications for impeachment. Finally, I'll note the context of Porter's domestic abuse scandal and the ongoing legal battle.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This move follows subpoenas for Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Rick Dearborn. Their testimonies, scheduled for September 17, aim to determine if Trump's actions warrant impeachment. Porter, a key figure in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, is central to the Democrats' case, as he witnessed Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by pressuring former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Democrats argue that Trump's actions, including pressuring former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, should be prosecuted. Porter's role in these events, along with his domestic abuse scandal, adds to the moral and legal scrutiny surrounding Trump's presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
