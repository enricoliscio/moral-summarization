SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter witnessed several episodes laid out in the Mueller report, including one where Trump allegedly instructed then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordered him to lie about it. Democrats also want to hear testimony about Trump's efforts to pressure the Attorney General to direct the investigation away from his campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure McGahn and find a replacement for the Attorney General who would end the Russia probe. Porter took notes during these incidents and left the White House after accusations of domestic abuse. The subpoena is part of the Committee's proceedings to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. The White House may seek to block the testimony, as it has with other former aides.
END OF SUMMARY.
