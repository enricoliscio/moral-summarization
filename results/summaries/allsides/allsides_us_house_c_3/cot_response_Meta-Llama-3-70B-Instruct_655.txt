SUMMARY:
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter witnessed several episodes of obstruction of justice, including Trump's attempts to direct White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats view this as key to their investigation of the Trump presidency. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in the Mueller report. Porter's testimony will help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. END OF SUMMARY.
