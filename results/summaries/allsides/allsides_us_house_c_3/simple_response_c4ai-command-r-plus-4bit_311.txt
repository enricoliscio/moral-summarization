SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged obstruction of justice and his efforts to impede the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This is a critical moral issue for the nation. Porter witnessed several episodes laid out in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to pressure then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then cover it up. According to the report, Trump referred to McGahn as a "lying bastard" and sought to replace him with someone who would end the Russia investigation. The subpoena is part of the Democratic-led committee's impeachment inquiry, with Chairman Jerrold Nadler stating that no one is above the law and that Trump's actions warrant prosecution. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to be subpoenaed, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The White House has previously blocked testimony from other aides, but it is unclear if they will do the same for Porter and Dearborn. The committee seeks to uphold justice and hold the president accountable for his actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
