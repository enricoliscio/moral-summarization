SUMMARY:
The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former Trump aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged attempts by President Trump to impede a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to be subpoenaed in recent weeks, alongside Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment based on evidence of obstruction of justice. Porter witnessed several episodes described in the Mueller report, including one where Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordered him to lie about it. Democrats also want to question Lewandowski and Dearborn about another damaging episode where Trump allegedly pressured the Attorney General to direct the Mueller investigation away from his campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure McGahn into denying the incident and to find a replacement for the Attorney General after he recused himself from the Russia probe. Porter's testimony could provide key insights into Trump's efforts to obstruct justice. However, it is unclear if the White House will block the testimony of Porter and other aides as they have done in the past.
