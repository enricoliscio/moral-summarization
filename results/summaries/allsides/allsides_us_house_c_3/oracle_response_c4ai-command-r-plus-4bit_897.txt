SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed in recent weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking information on Trump's efforts to obstruct justice by directing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and ordering then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to lie about it. According to the Mueller report, Trump instructed McGahn to remove the special counsel and then asked him to deny it, which McGahn refused to do. Trump also asked Porter to pressure McGahn into writing a letter of denial and to find a replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe. Democrats believe Porter's testimony will be key in determining whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter could provide insight into other incidents of concern, as he took contemporaneous notes during his time at the White House. His appearance before the committee is set for September 17.
