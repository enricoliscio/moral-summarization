SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with two other former Trump advisers, is set to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee aims to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. Porter's testimony is crucial as he witnessed key episodes, including Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by directing White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Democrats argue that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in Mueller's report. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that "no one is above the law." The subpoena is a significant step in holding Trump accountable for his actions, and Porter's testimony could be a crucial piece of evidence in the impeachment inquiry.

END OF SUMMARY.
