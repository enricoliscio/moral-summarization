Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they likely want a concise summary that maintains the ethical implications presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed Rob Porter, Corey Lewandowski, and Rick Dearborn. They're being called to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. The article mentions specific actions like obstructing justice, directing to fire the special counsel, lying, and other morally charged words.

I need to ensure that the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "interference," "efforts," "obstruct," "directing," "fire," "ordering," "lie," "instructed," "removed," "deny," "get," "lying," "asking," "find," "end," and "abuse" are crucial. These terms highlight the ethical issues involved.

I'll start by stating that the committee subpoenaed the three former advisers. Then, I'll mention their roles and the purpose of their testimony regarding Trump's efforts to impede the probe. I'll include details about Porter's involvement with McGahn, Trump's instructions, and the specific actions like lying and denying. Also, I'll note the Democrats' focus on these events to determine impeachment.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. I'll make sure to include the key points: the subpoena, the individuals involved, the nature of their testimony, the moral implications of Trump's actions, and the potential for impeachment.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the subpoena, moving into the specific actions, and ending with the implications for impeachment. I'll ensure that all the morally framed words are included to maintain the author's original ethical framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter, along with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice and impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Democrats aim to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter, a key witness, was involved in episodes described in the Mueller report, including Trump's directive to former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it. Trump also allegedly asked Porter to pressure McGahn to deny the instructions and considered replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would end the Russia investigation. Porter's testimony, along with Lewandowski's and Dearborn's, could provide critical insights into Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice and interfere with the probe. The proceedings highlight the moral and legal implications of Trump's actions, as Democrats argue that no one is above the law. Porter's involvement in these events, including his alleged domestic abuse, adds further moral complexity to the case. END OF SUMMARY.
