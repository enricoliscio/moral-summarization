Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want a concise summary that reflects the ethical implications discussed in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former Trump aide, to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice during the Russian interference probe. The article mentions other subpoenas for Lewandowski and Dearborn, and it ties into the Mueller report, which details Trump's actions to impede the investigation.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, such as Trump's alleged obstruction of justice, the pressure on McGahn, and the attempt to replace Sessions. Also, the Democrats' stance on accountability is important, as they see the evidence as grounds for impeachment.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements: the subpoena, the connection to Mueller's findings, Trump's actions, and the committee's intent to investigate impeachment. I'll make sure to include Nadler's statement about no one being above the law to emphasize the moral framing.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each important point is covered succinctly without losing the ethical context. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and direct, as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct justice during the Russian interference probe. This move follows subpoenas for Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn. The committee aims to determine if Trump should be impeached, with Democrats focusing on his alleged attempts to pressure former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House Counsel Don McGahn to end the investigation. According to the Mueller report, Trump instructed McGahn to fire the special counsel and lie about it, and later pressured Porter to ensure McGahn denied the orders. Porter also played a role in Trump's efforts to replace Sessions with someone who would halt the investigation. The committee's actions reflect the moral framing that no one, including the president, is above the law, and the evidence from Mueller's report could justify prosecution. END OF SUMMARY.
