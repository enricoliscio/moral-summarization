SUMMARY:
The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged attempts by President Donald Trump to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed by the committee in the past two weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The hearings are part of the committee's investigation into whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter witnessed several episodes described in the Mueller report, including one where Trump allegedly tried to pressure then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. According to the report, Trump called McGahn a "lying bastard" and considered firing him. Porter also understood the president to want him to find a replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia probe. The committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, emphasized that no one is above the law and that the evidence against Trump would have led to prosecution for any other American. Porter could provide key testimony on Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, despite potential attempts by the White House to block his testimony. The summary also mentions Porter's departure from the White House amid accusations of domestic abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
