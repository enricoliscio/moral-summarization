SUMMARY:

The US House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to receive a subpoena in the past two weeks, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. They are scheduled to appear before the committee on September 17. The committee is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by directing White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller and then ordering him to lie about it. Porter witnessed several episodes laid out in Mueller's report and took contemporaneous notes. Democrats want to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, stated that "no one is above the law" and that any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence uncovered in Mueller's report.

END OF SUMMARY.
