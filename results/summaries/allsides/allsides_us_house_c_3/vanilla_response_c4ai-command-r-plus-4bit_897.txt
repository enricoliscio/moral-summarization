SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice during the Russia probe. Porter, along with Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, are due to appear before the committee on September 17. Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated that the proceedings will help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter witnessed several key episodes in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempt to fire Mueller and pressure Jeff Sessions to direct the investigation away from the Trump campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure then-White House Counsel Don McGahn into writing a letter of denial. Porter also understood Trump's request to reach out to Rachel Brand as an attempt to find someone to end the Russia investigation. Porter took contemporaneous notes during other incidents of interest and left the White House in 2018 amid domestic abuse accusations. The White House may seek to block the testimony of Porter and Dearborn, as they have with other former aides.

END OF SUMMARY.
