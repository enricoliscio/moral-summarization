Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rob Porter, a former Trump aide, to testify about Trump's efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. Porter is one of three former advisers subpoenaed recently. The committee wants to determine if Trump should be impeached. Porter was involved in key episodes mentioned in the Mueller report, including Trump's attempts to obstruct justice by directing Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. Democrats see this as crucial for their investigation. They also want testimony on Trump's pressure on Jeff Sessions to divert the investigation. Nadler emphasized that no one is above the law, implying potential prosecution based on Mueller's findings. Porter's involvement includes Trump asking him to pressure McGahn and to reach out to Rachel Brand for a possible replacement. Porter left the White House amid domestic abuse allegations.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words: interference, efforts, obstruct, directing, fire, ordering, lie, instructed, removed, asked, deny, get, lying, asking, find, end, abuse.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, making sure the moral implications are clear. I'll start by mentioning the subpoena and the context of impeding the probe. Then, I'll highlight Trump's efforts to obstruct justice, using words like directing, fire, ordering, lie. I'll mention the Mueller report details, including Trump's instructions to McGahn and Porter's role. I'll note the Democrats' focus on these episodes and Nadler's statement about the law. Finally, I'll include the domestic abuse context as it relates to Porter's background.

I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the moral framing words without making the summary too clunky. Also, I'll ensure that the key points are covered: the subpoena, Trump's actions, Mueller's findings, and the committee's intent to consider impeachment.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to obstruct a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter, along with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn, is set to appear before the committee on September 17. Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated the proceedings aim to determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment. Porter was involved in key episodes detailed in the Mueller report, including Trump's directive to former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it. Democrats are also focusing on Trump's alleged efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to divert the Russia investigation. Nadler emphasized that "no one is above the law," suggesting Trump could face prosecution based on Mueller's findings. Porter, who left the White House amid domestic abuse allegations, reportedly took notes during incidents involving Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, including asking McGahn to deny instructions and seeking a replacement for Sessions to "end" the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
