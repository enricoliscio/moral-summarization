SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts to impede a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump's possible obstruction of justice. Porter is the third former Trump adviser to be subpoenaed in recent weeks as part of the Committee's investigation into potential grounds for impeachment. According to the Mueller report, Porter witnessed and participated in several episodes that Democrats view as key to their investigation of Trump's presidency, including attempts to obstruct the Russia probe and pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The report also mentions Porter's understanding that Trump wanted to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the special counsel. Porter is expected to testify alongside Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn, with the Committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler, stating that "no one is above the law" and emphasizing the seriousness of the alleged damaging episodes. The White House's response to these subpoenas remains uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
