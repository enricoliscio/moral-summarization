SUMMARY:

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump's alleged efforts to impede the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Porter, a key witness in the Mueller report, is expected to testify about Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, including directing White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordering him to lie about it. Democrats believe that Porter's testimony will help determine whether to recommend Trump's impeachment to the full House of Representatives. As Chairman Jerrold Nadler stated, "No one is above the law," and it is imperative that Trump is held accountable for his actions. The subpoena is a crucial step in ensuring that the truth is revealed and that justice is served.
