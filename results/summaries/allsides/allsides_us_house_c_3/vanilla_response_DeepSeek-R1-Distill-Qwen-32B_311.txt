Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully.

The article is about the U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaing Rob Porter, a former White House aide, to testify about Trump's alleged efforts to impede the Russian interference probe. Porter is the third Trump adviser subpoenaed recently. He and others are set to appear on Sept. 17. The committee is led by Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who says this could lead to recommending Trump's impeachment.

Porter was involved in key events described in the Mueller report, like Trump pressuring Don McGahn to fire Mueller and lie about it. Democrats want testimony on Trump's attempts to influence Jeff Sessions. Nadler emphasizes that Trump isn't above the law.

Porter's role included pressuring McGahn and possibly replacing Sessions. He left the White House in 2018 after domestic abuse allegations.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: subpoena, Porter's role, Mueller's findings, potential impeachment, and Porter's background.

Make sure to include the date, committee, and relevant details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Keep it clear and to the point.
