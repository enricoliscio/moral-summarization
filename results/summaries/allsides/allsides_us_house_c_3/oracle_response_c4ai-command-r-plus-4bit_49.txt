SUMMARY: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter to testify about alleged efforts by President Donald Trump to impede the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Porter is one of three former Trump advisers subpoenaed in recent weeks, including Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. The committee is seeking information about potential obstruction of justice by Trump, who allegedly instructed then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then ordered him to lie about it. Democrats also want to question Lewandowski and Dearborn about Trump's efforts to pressure the attorney general to redirect the investigation away from his campaign. According to the Mueller report, Trump asked Porter to pressure McGahn into writing a letter of denial and sought a replacement for the attorney general who had recused himself from the Russia probe. Porter, who took contemporaneous notes during key incidents, left the White House amid accusations of domestic abuse. The White House may seek to block the testimony of some witnesses, but Lewandowski has said he will testify. The committee's proceedings could contribute to a decision on recommending Trump's impeachment.
END OF SUMMARY.
