SUMMARY:

The devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy has reignited the debate over the role of government in disaster relief. President Obama has emphasized the importance of the federal government's support, offering the full resources of the government to affected areas. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have historically advocated for a more decentralized approach, relying on local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney's past comments, suggesting that disaster relief should be cut from the federal budget, have been criticized in light of the current disaster. However, even Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response, thanking President Obama for his personal attention. The debate highlights fundamentally different moral visions: one that sees the federal government as a critical vehicle for collective action and support, and another that prioritizes individual initiative and limited government intervention.
