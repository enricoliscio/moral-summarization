Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to keep the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the debate over the government's role in disaster relief, specifically in the context of Hurricane Sandy. The author used certain morally framed words like prayers, help, cleaning, disaster, send, delivering, attention, relief, borrowing, jeopardizing, and ignored. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is emphasizing federal government assistance, while Romney supports local efforts and the private sector. There's a contrast between their approaches, with Romney focusing on decentralized disaster relief and Obama ensuring federal resources are fully utilized. The article also mentions Romney's past comments about reducing federal spending, which is relevant given the current situation.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral perspectives each side presents. Obama's use of "prayers" and "help" shows empathy and a proactive federal role. Romney's "cleaning" metaphor and focus on local efforts versus federal intervention are key. The moral framing around "borrowing" and "jeopardizing" the future points to Romney's concerns about federal spending. Also, the fact that Romney "ignored" questions about FEMA funding adds a moral critique of his stance.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start by introducing the debate, then outline each candidate's position, incorporating the moral words. I'll conclude with the ongoing debate and the implications of their policies.

Let me make sure I include all the key points: Obama's federal assistance, Romney's local and voluntary efforts, the contrast in their approaches, Romney's past comments on federal spending, the praise from Gov. Christie, and the ongoing debate. I'll also ensure that the moral words are naturally integrated without forcing them in.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and making sure it's clear and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: President Obama emphasized federal government assistance in Sandy's aftermath, offering "prayers" and "help" to affected communities, while Mitt Romney highlighted local and voluntary efforts, using a "cleaning" metaphor to stress individual responsibility. Romney has advocated decentralizing disaster relief, suggesting federal roles should be minimized, even "sending" responsibilities back to states and the private sector. However, Obama has promised to "deliver" federal resources efficiently, ensuring "attention" to recovery without bureaucratic delays. Gov. Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response, though Romney avoided discussing FEMA funding during a recent event. Romney's past comments on reducing federal spending, including disaster relief, raise concerns about "jeopardizing" future generations due to borrowing. The debate over the federal role in disasters continues, with Obama advocating an active federal presence, while Romney focuses on local solutions. END OF SUMMARY.
