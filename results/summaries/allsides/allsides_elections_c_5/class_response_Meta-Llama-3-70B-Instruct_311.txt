SUMMARY: 
President Obama has offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, highlighting the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments suggest that he believes disaster relief should be decentralized, with the private sector playing a larger role. However, in the face of Sandy's devastation, even Republican Governor Chris Christie has praised the federal response, thanking the president for his personal attention. The debate over the government's role in disaster relief has moral implications, with Obama's approach emphasizing the importance of delivering help and relief, while Romney's stance raises concerns about borrowing and jeopardizing the future. As Obama tours hard-hit New Jersey, he will continue to make the case for an active federal role in providing disaster relief. END OF SUMMARY.
