SUMMARY:

President Obama offered "thoughts and prayers" to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney emphasize the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments suggest that disaster relief should be decentralized, with the federal government playing a limited role. However, even Republican officials like Gov. Chris Christie have praised the federal response to Sandy, acknowledging the "outstanding" attention from the administration. Meanwhile, Romney's previous statement that disaster relief should be considered for budget cuts seems at odds with the current crisis. As Obama tours hard-hit New Jersey, he will continue to make the case for an active federal role in providing "relief" and "help" to those in need. END OF SUMMARY.
