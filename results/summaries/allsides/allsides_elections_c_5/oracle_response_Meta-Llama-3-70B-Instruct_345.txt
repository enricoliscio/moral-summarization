SUMMARY:

President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, highlighting the virtue of individual action. Romney argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, suggesting that the private sector could take on more responsibility. However, Obama's administration has been delivering on its promise to help, with FEMA director Craig Fugate keeping red tape from getting in the way of recovery. Even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, thanking the president personally for his attention to the crisis. The debate highlights the moral imperative of government assistance in times of disaster, with Obama's approach emphasizing the importance of collective help and Romney's approach prioritizing individual responsibility.
