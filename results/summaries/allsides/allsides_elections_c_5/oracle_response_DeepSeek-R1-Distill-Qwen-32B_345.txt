Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the debate over the government's role in disaster relief, specifically after Hurricane Sandy. The author used certain morally framed words like "thoughts," "prayers," "help," "named," "keep," "getting," "delivering," "disasters," "borrowing," and "jeopardizing." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama emphasized federal government assistance, offering help and resources. Romney, on the other hand, focused on local efforts and the private sector, using a story about students cleaning up a football field. He believes in decentralizing disaster relief, moving responsibilities back to states and the private sector. However, Romney didn't say voluntary efforts alone should replace government help.

The article also mentions that FEMA under Obama is more effective, with Governor Christie praising the federal response. Despite this, Republicans like Romney still want to reduce federal spending, including FEMA's budget. Romney's past comments about borrowing and jeopardizing the future for kids are highlighted as problematic in light of Sandy.

I need to condense this into a summary, keeping the morally framed words. I should structure it to show the contrast between Obama and Romney's approaches, mention the effectiveness of FEMA under Obama, and touch on Romney's stance on federal spending and borrowing.

I'll start with Obama offering help and resources, then contrast with Romney's emphasis on local efforts. Include the story about the football field and Romney's belief in decentralization. Mention that Romney doesn't advocate replacing government entirely but still wants to reduce federal involvement. Highlight FEMA's effectiveness and Christie's praise. Conclude with Romney's past comments on borrowing and jeopardizing the future, tying it back to the current storm situation.

Make sure to use the key moral words: thoughts, prayers, help, named, keep, getting, delivering, disasters, borrowing, jeopardizing. I need to fit these naturally into the summary without making it forced.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well, highlighting the moral aspects as presented in the article.
