SUMMARY:

The article highlights the differing views of President Obama and Mitt Romney on the role of government in disaster relief. President Obama emphasized the importance of the federal government's resources in helping those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising to do everything possible to support them. In contrast, Romney's approach emphasizes local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. While Romney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone are a substitute for government, he has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending. The article notes that even Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response, thanking President Obama for his personal attention. The debate raises questions about the balance between government support and individual initiative in times of crisis.
