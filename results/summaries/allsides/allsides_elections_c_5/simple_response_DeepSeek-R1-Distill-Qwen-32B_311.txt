Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the aftermath of Sandy and how it highlights the debate between Democrats and Republicans regarding the role of government in disaster relief. President Obama emphasizes federal government support, offering resources and stating that America is with the affected people. On the other hand, Mitt Romney supports local government and voluntary efforts, as seen in his canned food drive and his past statements about decentralizing disaster relief.

I notice that the author contrasts Obama's approach with Romney's, highlighting their differing views on federal vs. state/local roles. Romney's example of the students cleaning the football field is a metaphor for individual responsibility. However, the article also points out that Romney doesn't completely dismiss government help, but during a debate, he argued for reducing federal involvement.

The article mentions that while Romney avoids discussing FEMA funding when asked, Obama is actively involved, touring affected areas. It also notes that some states, like Texas and Oklahoma, which are more Republican, still rely on federal disaster declarations, complicating the political stance.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to be about the responsibility and effectiveness of government intervention versus individual and local efforts. The summary should reflect the contrast in their approaches and the implications for disaster relief policies.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the debate, then outline Obama's stance, followed by Romney's, including his past comments. Then mention the current federal response and Romney's avoidance of discussing FEMA funding. Finally, touch on the political implications, like states' reliance on federal help despite political leanings.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include all key points. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and objective, preserving the moral elements presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy has reignited the debate over the federal government's role in disaster relief. President Obama emphasized federal support, stating, "America's with you," and offering the full resources of the government to aid recovery. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney highlighted the importance of local efforts and individual action, using a parable about community responsibility. Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, advocating for returning responsibilities to states and the private sector. However, he did not dismiss federal aid entirely. Despite political differences, the federal response has been praised by Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. Obama has promised to streamline federal assistance, ensuring states can bypass red tape. Romney, while acknowledging the need for federal involvement, has avoided discussing FEMA funding cuts, which remain a target for budget reductions. The storm underscores the tension between federal activism and local autonomy, with Obama set to emphasize the federal role in disaster relief.  
END OF SUMMARY.
