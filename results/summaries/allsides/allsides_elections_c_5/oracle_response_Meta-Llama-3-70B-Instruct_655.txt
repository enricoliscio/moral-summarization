SUMMARY:

President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney sponsored a canned food drive and told a parable about the importance of individual responsibility, but did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone are a substitute for government help. While Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, President Obama has promised to keep red tape from getting in the way of recovery, and so far, the federal government seems to be delivering. Even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, thanking the president personally for his attention. The debate highlights the moral imperative of government help in times of disaster, with Obama emphasizing the need for collective action and Romney cautioning against borrowing and jeopardizing the future.
