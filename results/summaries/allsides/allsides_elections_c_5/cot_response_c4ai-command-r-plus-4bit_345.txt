SUMMARY:
In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the debate over the role of the government in disaster relief has been underscored. President Obama has offered thoughts, prayers, and tangible support to those affected, pledging the full resources of the federal government to help. He believes in the critical role of the federal government in providing aid. On the other hand, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has placed more faith in local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney shared a parable from his high school days, emphasizing the virtue of individual action. While he did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone should replace government aid, he has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief as much as possible. FEMA, under President Obama's leadership, has been headed by a disaster professional, Craig Fugate, who understands the states' perspective. Obama has promised to cut red tape and ensure smooth disaster recovery. The effectiveness of the federal government's response has been acknowledged by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who praised the administration's efforts. However, Republicans remain committed to reducing federal spending, with FEMA's budget being an attractive target. Romney's previous comments on disaster relief spending have become inconvenient in light of the storm. The article concludes with Obama's planned tour of hard-hit New Jersey, emphasizing his commitment to an active federal role in disaster relief.
