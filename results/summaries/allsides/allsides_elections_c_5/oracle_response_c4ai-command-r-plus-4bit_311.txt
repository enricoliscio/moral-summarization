SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offer help to those affected by Sandy, the debate over the role of the government in disaster relief is underscored. Obama pledges the full resources of the federal government, emphasizing its critical role in helping communities get back on their feet. Romney, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, recalling a high school parable where each student took responsibility for cleaning a small section of a football field. Romney believes in decentralizing disaster relief, sending it back to the states or even the private sector if possible. However, during a Republican primary debate last year, Romney acknowledged the importance of disaster relief, stating that borrowing should not jeopardize the future for our kids. FEMA, under the leadership of disaster professional Craig Fugate, has been praised by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for its outstanding response to the storm. Obama has promised to cut through red tape and keep the federal government delivering. The FEMA budget remains a target for Republicans aiming to reduce federal spending, but in light of this week's storm, the importance of disaster relief is brought to the forefront.
