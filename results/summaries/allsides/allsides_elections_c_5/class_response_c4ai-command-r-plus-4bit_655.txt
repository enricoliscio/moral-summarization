SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offer prayers and assistance to those affected by Sandy, their differing views on the role of the government in disaster relief are highlighted. Obama emphasizes the federal government's crucial role in helping communities get back on their feet, while Republicans favor local government and voluntary efforts. Romney previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, sending it "back to the states" and even "the private sector." FEMA's role has been debated, with some questioning its effectiveness and cost. However, during the storm, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response and FEMA's efforts. While Romney has ignored questions about FEMA funding, Obama has promised to cut through red tape and provide direct assistance to those in need. The contrasting approaches to disaster relief reflect a deeper ideological divide between the two candidates and their parties.
