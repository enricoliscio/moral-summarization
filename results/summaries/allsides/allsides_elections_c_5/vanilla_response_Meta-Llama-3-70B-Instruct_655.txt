SUMMARY:

President Obama has offered the full resources of the federal government to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have traditionally advocated for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief, relying on local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney has suggested in the past that disaster relief should be handled by the states or private sector whenever possible. However, in the wake of Sandy, even Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response, thanking President Obama for his personal attention to the crisis. The debate highlights the differing views on the role of government in disaster relief, with Obama's administration pushing for a more active federal role and Republicans seeking to reduce federal spending.
