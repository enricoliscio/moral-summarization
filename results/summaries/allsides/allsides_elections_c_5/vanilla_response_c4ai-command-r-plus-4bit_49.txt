SUMMARY: The devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy has brought the debate over the role of government in disaster relief to the forefront. President Obama has promised the full support of the federal government in the recovery efforts, while his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, has emphasized the importance of local government and voluntary initiatives. Romney previously argued that disaster relief should be decentralized and that states and the private sector should take the lead. However, even Republican governors affected by the storm, such as Chris Christie of New Jersey, have praised the federal response and FEMA's efforts. The FEMA budget remains a target for spending cuts by Republicans aiming to reduce federal spending, but disasters like Sandy underscore the importance of a robust federal role in disaster relief. Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal government in disaster response as he tours storm-damaged areas in New Jersey.
