SUMMARY:

The article highlights the differing views of President Obama and Mitt Romney on the role of the federal government in disaster relief. While Obama believes the federal government should play a critical role in providing aid, Romney puts more faith in local government and voluntary efforts. Romney's stance is exemplified by his sponsorship of a canned food drive and his parable about individual action, which suggests that decentralized efforts can be effective. However, Obama's administration has been praised by Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey for its prompt and effective response to Hurricane Sandy. The article also notes that Romney's previous comments on reducing federal spending, including disaster relief, may be seen as incongruous in light of the current disaster. The debate underscores the moral question of whether the government should prioritize individual freedom and local autonomy or collective responsibility and federal support in times of crisis.
