SUMMARY:
President Obama pledged his thoughts, prayers, and tangible resources to those affected by Sandy, demonstrating his belief in an active federal government during times of crisis. He promised to cut through any red tape that could hinder the recovery process. This stance contrasts with Mitt Romney's faith in local governments and voluntary efforts as the primary vehicles for disaster relief. Romney shared a parable extolling the virtue of individual action, recalling a high school experience where students cleaned a football field by each taking responsibility for a small section. While Romney did not suggest that such voluntary efforts are a substitute for government aid, he has previously advocated for decentralizing disaster relief as much as possible. The article also highlights the praise given by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for the federal response, despite the state's Democratic leanings in the presidential race. However, in the broader context, Republicans remain focused on reducing federal spending, making the FEMA budget a target. Romney's previous comments about disaster relief being on the chopping block are now inconvenient in light of the week's events. The moral framing of the article underscores the debate between centralized federal aid and localized individual action in the face of disasters like Sandy.
