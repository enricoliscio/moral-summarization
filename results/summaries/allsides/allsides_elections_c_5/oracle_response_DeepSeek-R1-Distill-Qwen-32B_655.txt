Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words: thoughts, prayers, help, named, keep, getting, delivering, disasters, borrowing, jeopardizing. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The article talks about President Obama and Mitt Romney's approaches to disaster relief after Sandy. Obama emphasizes federal government involvement, while Romney supports local and voluntary efforts. I should highlight their differing views using the moral words. 

Also, the article mentions Romney's past comments on reducing federal spending and disaster relief, which ties into "borrowing" and "jeopardizing." I need to include that part to show Romney's stance on federal budget cuts.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Obama's and Romney's positions, then mention Romney's past comments on borrowing and jeopardizing the future. Finally, I'll note the ongoing debate and Obama's continued advocacy for federal role.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: President Obama emphasized the federal government's role in disaster relief after Hurricane Sandy, offering "thoughts" and "prayers" while pledging federal "help." He assured affected communities that "America's with you," highlighting the government's responsibility to "deliver" aid. In contrast, Mitt Romney advocated for local and voluntary efforts, sharing a story about individual "cleaning" efforts, though he did not dismiss federal aid entirely. Romney previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, suggesting returning responsibilities to states and the private sector. State disaster officials have clashed with federal agencies in the past, but Obama's FEMA director, Craig Fugate, has aimed to reduce "red tape" and ensure "getting" aid to those in need. Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response, acknowledging the administration's "outstanding" support. However, Romney's past comments on reducing federal spending, including FEMA funding, remain contentious, as he argued for cutting federal programs to avoid "borrowing" and "jeopardizing" the future. The debate over the federal government's role in disaster relief continues, with Obama advocating for an active federal presence in the wake of Sandy. END OF SUMMARY.
