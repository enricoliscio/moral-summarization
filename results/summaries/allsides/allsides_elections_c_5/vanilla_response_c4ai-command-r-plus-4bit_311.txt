SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney offered support and resources to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, but their approaches highlighted their differing views on the role of government in disaster relief. Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government, arguing that it plays a critical role in helping communities recover. Romney, meanwhile, emphasized the importance of local government and individual action, recalling a high school story where each student was responsible for cleaning a small section of a football field. During the Republican primary debate last year, Romney argued for decentralized disaster relief, sending power back to the states or even the private sector. This view, however, may be inconvenient in light of the scale of the current disaster. FEMA, under Obama, is headed by a disaster professional who understands the states' perspective. Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response, despite his party's stance on reducing federal spending. Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal role as he tours hard-hit New Jersey. This event underscores the ongoing debate about the proper role of government in disaster relief and the tension between federal and state power.
END OF SUMMARY.
