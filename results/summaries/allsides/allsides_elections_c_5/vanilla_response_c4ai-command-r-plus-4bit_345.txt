SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney responded to the devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy by highlighting their differing views on the role of government in disaster relief. Obama pledged the full support of the federal government, stating that it is crucial in helping communities recover from disasters. Romney, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, recalling a story from his high school days where students cleaned up a football field by each taking responsibility for a small section. Romney argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, empowering states and the private sector to take the lead. While Romney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone should replace government disaster relief, he has previously targeted the FEMA budget as a potential area for spending cuts. The article also notes the political implications of disaster relief, with Republican governors praising the federal response despite their party's stance on reducing federal spending. Obama will continue to emphasize the federal government's role by touring storm-hit areas in New Jersey.
