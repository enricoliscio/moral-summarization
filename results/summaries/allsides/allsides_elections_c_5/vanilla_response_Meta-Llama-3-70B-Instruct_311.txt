SUMMARY:

President Obama has offered the full resources of the federal government to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have expressed faith in local government and voluntary efforts to handle disaster relief. Romney has argued in the past that disaster relief should be decentralized and handed over to states and the private sector. However, in the wake of Sandy, even Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response, thanking President Obama for his personal attention to the crisis. The debate highlights the differing views on the role of government in disaster relief, with Obama advocating for a strong federal response and Romney suggesting a more limited role. The issue takes on added significance as Romney's past comments on cutting FEMA funding have come under scrutiny.
