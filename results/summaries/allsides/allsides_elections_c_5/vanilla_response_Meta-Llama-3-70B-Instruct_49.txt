SUMMARY:

President Obama has offered the full resources of the federal government to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have expressed faith in local government and voluntary efforts, suggesting that disaster relief should be decentralized and potentially privatized. However, Romney's previous comments on reducing federal spending, including FEMA funding, have been called into question in light of the storm. Despite this, Romney sponsored a canned food drive for storm victims and told a parable about the virtue of individual action. Meanwhile, Obama has promised to keep red tape from getting in the way of recovery, and Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response. The debate highlights differing views on the role of government in disaster relief. END OF SUMMARY.
