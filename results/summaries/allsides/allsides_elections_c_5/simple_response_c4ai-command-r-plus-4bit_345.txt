SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney respond to Superstorm Sandy, their contrasting views on the role of government are on full display. Obama emphasizes the importance of the federal government in providing resources and support to those affected by the storm, pledging to cut through red tape and personally ensure that governors and mayors get the help they need. Romney, on the other hand, emphasizes local government and individual action, sharing a parable about the power of individual effort in high school. While Romney does not suggest that voluntary efforts alone are sufficient, he has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief and sending it "back to the states" or even "the private sector." Republicans, including Romney, have targeted the FEMA budget for cuts as part of their efforts to reduce federal spending. However, disasters like Sandy underscore the critical role of the federal government in providing support and resources during times of crisis. Even Republican governors, like Chris Christie of New Jersey, have praised the federal response and FEMA's efforts. Obama will continue to showcase the federal government's role as he tours hard-hit areas in New Jersey.
END OF SUMMARY.
