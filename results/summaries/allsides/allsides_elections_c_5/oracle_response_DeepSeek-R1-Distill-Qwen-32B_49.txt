Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words: thoughts, prayers, help, named, keep, getting, delivering, disasters, borrowing, jeopardizing. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the debate over the government's role in disaster response, specifically after Hurricane Sandy. President Obama emphasized federal government assistance, while Mitt Romney supports local and voluntary efforts. The article also mentions Romney's past comments on decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending, which might be problematic given recent events.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Obama's offer of thoughts and prayers, along with federal help. Then contrast that with Romney's focus on local efforts and his example of students cleaning a football field. I should include the morally framed words here, like "help" and "named" when talking about Romney's past comments.

Next, I'll note the federal government's delivery of aid, especially FEMA's role, and mention the praise from Governor Christie. Then, I'll touch on the budget concerns, using "borrowing" and "jeopardizing" as Romney's argument against federal spending. Finally, I'll end with Obama's continued advocacy for federal involvement.

I should ensure the summary flows well, includes all key points, and maintains the moral perspective by using the specified words. Let me structure this step by step to make sure I cover all aspects without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Obama offered thoughts and prayers for Sandy victims, emphasizing the federal government's role in providing help. He assured affected communities that America stands behind them, using the federal government as a critical tool for recovery. In contrast, Mitt Romney highlighted the virtue of individual action, citing a parable about students cleaning a football field by taking responsibility for their own "lane." Romney argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, with states and the private sector taking the lead. However, Romney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone could replace government assistance. Despite this, during a Republican debate, Romney criticized federal disaster relief, advocating for returning responsibilities to states and the private sector. State disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, though recent efforts under FEMA director Craig Fugate have been praised. Obama has promised to minimize red tape and ensure federal aid is delivered effectively. Republican Gov. Chris Christie commended the federal response, calling it "outstanding." However, for Romney and other Republicans focused on reducing federal spending, FEMA's budget remains a target. Romney previously argued that borrowing $1.6 trillion more annually makes it unsustainable to continue federal disaster relief as is, jeopardizing the future for children. Romney avoided discussing FEMA funding during a recent event, while Obama continues to advocate for an active federal role in disaster recovery. END OF SUMMARY.
