Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sandy and the debate over the government's role. The user also wants me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me read through the article again to make sure I catch everything.

First, the article talks about President Obama offering thoughts and prayers, and then providing federal resources. The key morally framed words here might be "thoughts and prayers," "critical," "help," "standing behind," "America's with you," and "everything we can." These phrases carry emotional weight and convey support and responsibility.

Then, it mentions Republicans like Romney, who emphasize local government and voluntary efforts. Romney's example of cleaning up a football field is a moral story about individual responsibility. So words like "voluntary efforts," "individual action," "responsibility," and "cleaning their lane" are morally framed.

Romney also talks about decentralizing disaster relief, which ties into his belief in reducing federal involvement. The article mentions "decentralized," "private sector," and "right direction," which are part of the moral argument against big government.

There's a clash between state and federal officials, but Obama has improved FEMA by naming a professional. Terms like "clashed," "professional," "outstanding," and "personal attention" highlight the moral stance of effective leadership and support.

The article also touches on fiscal responsibility with Romney's comments about borrowing money and cutting federal spending. Words like "borrowing," "chopping block," "federal spending," and "jeopardizing the future" are morally charged as they relate to financial responsibility and the impact on future generations.

Finally, the summary needs to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while staying under 200 words. I'll structure it to show the contrast between Obama's federal approach and Romney's local and voluntary approach, highlighting the moral arguments each side presents.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama emphasized the federal government's role in aiding Sandy victims, offering "thoughts and prayers" and pledging "everything we can" to help. He highlighted the importance of the federal government as a "critical" resource, stating, "America's with you." In contrast, Mitt Romney advocated for "voluntary efforts" and "individual action," using a parable about cleaning a football field to illustrate the virtue of decentralized responsibility. Romney argued that disaster relief should be "as decentralized as possible," favoring the "private sector" over federal intervention. However, Obama's administration, led by FEMA director Craig Fugate, has been praised for its "outstanding" response, with Republican Gov. Chris Christie commending the federal effort. Despite this, Romney's earlier comments about reducing federal spending and "borrowing" raise questions about his commitment to disaster relief funding. Obama will continue to advocate for an "active federal role" in aiding storm victims. END OF SUMMARY.
