SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offer support and resources to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, their differing approaches to the role of the federal government in disaster relief are highlighted. Obama emphasizes the federal government's role in helping those affected by the storm, while Romney places more faith in local government and individual efforts. During last year's Republican primary debate, Romney argued for decentralizing disaster relief as much as possible, sending it "back to the states" or "even better," the private sector. However, Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response to the storm, thanking President Obama and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate for their outstanding support. Texas and Oklahoma, both Republican-leaning states, lead the nation in federal disaster declarations, presenting a moral dilemma for Republicans who aim to reduce federal spending. Romney's previous comments about disaster relief being a potential target for budget cuts may come back to haunt him, as they seem at odds with the spirit of this week's relief efforts. Obama, on the other hand, continues to advocate for an active federal role in disaster relief, demonstrating his commitment to those affected by the storm.
