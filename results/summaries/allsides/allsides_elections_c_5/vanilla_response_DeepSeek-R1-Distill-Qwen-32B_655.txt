Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sandy and the debate over the government's role in disaster relief. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning President Obama offering support and federal resources to those affected by Sandy. He emphasizes that the federal government is crucial for providing help. On the other hand, Republicans like Mitt Romney believe more in local government and voluntary efforts. Romney even organized a canned food drive and used a story about students cleaning up a football field to illustrate the importance of individual action. However, he didn't say that voluntary efforts alone should replace government help.

The article also mentions Romney's past stance on disaster relief, arguing that it should be decentralized and possibly handled by the private sector. There's a mention of state officials sometimes clashing with the federal government, but under Obama, FEMA is led by a professional, Craig Fugate, who understands state perspectives. Obama has promised to reduce bureaucracy to aid recovery.

Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, praised Obama's federal response, which is notable because New Jersey leans Democratic. However, Texas and Oklahoma, which are more Republican, have had many federal disaster declarations, and some Republicans still want to cut FEMA's budget due to federal spending concerns. Romney avoided talking about FEMA funding when asked recently.

The summary needs to capture the debate between Obama's federal approach and Romney's emphasis on local efforts and private sector involvement. It should mention the praise from Christie and the potential budget cuts. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

I'll start by outlining the main sections: Obama's federal response, Romney's local and voluntary approach, the clash between state and federal governments, Obama's FEMA leadership, Christie's praise, and the budget concerns. Then, I'll condense each into a concise sentence or two, ensuring the summary flows logically.

I should make sure to include that while Romney supports local efforts, he doesn't dismiss government entirely, but he does advocate for decentralization. Also, highlight that Christie, a Republican, approved of Obama's handling, which is a point against the usual political divide on such issues.

Finally, I'll mention Romney's stance on cutting federal spending and how this week's storm complicates that position, as well as Obama's continued advocacy for federal involvement.

Putting it all together, the summary should be clear, concise, and capture the essence of the article without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama emphasized federal government support for Sandy victims, offering prayers and resources, while Mitt Romney highlighted local and voluntary efforts. Romney, during a canned food drive, stressed individual action, though he acknowledged the need for government aid. He previously advocated decentralizing disaster relief, favoring state and private sector involvement. Obama, in contrast, has streamlined federal disaster response through FEMA, led by Craig Fugate, a former state official. Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response, despite New Jersey's Democratic lean. However, Texas and Oklahoma, with high disaster declarations, highlight challenges for Republicans seeking to reduce federal spending. Romney avoided discussing FEMA funding recently, while Obama continues to advocate for federal disaster aid.  
END OF SUMMARY.
