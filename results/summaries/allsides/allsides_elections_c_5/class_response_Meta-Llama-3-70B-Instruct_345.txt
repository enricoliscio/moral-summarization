SUMMARY: President Obama offered "thoughts and prayers" to those affected by Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to "help" them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments, however, have suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized, and that FEMA funding could be cut to reduce borrowing and avoid "jeopardizing" the future. Despite this, Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, thanking the president for his "personal attention" to the crisis. As Obama continues to make the case for an active federal role, Romney's stance on FEMA funding remains an inconvenient truth. The president's commitment to "delivering" relief and "cleaning" up the mess left by Sandy stands in stark contrast to Romney's emphasis on individual action and fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
