SUMMARY:
President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them recover. He emphasized that "America's with you" and that the government will do everything it can to help people get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, suggesting that the federal government's role should be limited. However, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, calling it "outstanding." The debate highlights the different moral perspectives on the role of government in times of crisis, with Obama advocating for an active federal role and Romney emphasizing the importance of individual action and limited government intervention.
