SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney both offered help and prayers to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, but their approaches to disaster relief differ significantly. Obama emphasized the role of the federal government in providing assistance, promising to cut through red tape and personally ensure that states receive the support they need. On the other hand, Romney has previously argued for a decentralized approach, suggesting that disaster relief should be handled by local governments or even voluntary efforts. Romney's comments during a Republican primary debate last year highlighted his belief in reducing federal spending, even suggesting that disaster relief could be cut. However, in light of Sandy, these comments may be inconvenient. While Romney ignored questions about FEMA funding, Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal role in disaster relief by touring hard-hit areas in New Jersey. Both candidates recognize the importance of helping those affected by the storm, but their differing views on the role of government in disaster relief underscore the ongoing debate over the proper balance between federal and state power.
END OF SUMMARY.
