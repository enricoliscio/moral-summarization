SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offered thoughts and prayers to those affected by Sandy, their differing views on the role of the government in disaster relief were underscored. Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government, seeing it as a critical vehicle for help. Romney, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, citing a high school parable where individual action accomplished a big task. Romney's previous statements during a Republican primary debate suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized, sending power back to states and the private sector. While Romney did not dismiss the need for federal involvement, he targeted the FEMA budget as a potential area for spending cuts, given the nation's fiscal challenges. However, in light of the recent storm, these comments may be inconvenient. Obama has promised to ensure red tape doesn't impede recovery and is personally committed to helping. So far, the federal government, led by FEMA, has received praise for its response, even from Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. This disaster highlights the ongoing debate about the appropriate level of federal involvement in disaster relief and the balance between helping those in need and fiscal responsibility.
