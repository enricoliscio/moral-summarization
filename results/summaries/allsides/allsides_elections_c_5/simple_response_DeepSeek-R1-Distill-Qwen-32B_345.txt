Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article contrasts Obama's federal approach with Romney's emphasis on local and voluntary efforts during Sandy. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Obama offers federal help, Romney supports local and private initiatives. The article mentions Romney's past comments on decentralizing disaster relief and his recent actions. Also, it notes that states affected by Sandy are mostly Democratic, but disaster funding remains a target for budget cuts.

I should highlight the debate between federal vs. local efforts, the effectiveness of Obama's FEMA, and Romney's stance on reducing federal involvement. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments and examples without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating the debate, then describe each candidate's position. I'll mention Romney's parable and past comments, then note the federal response's effectiveness and Romney's recent praise. Finally, I'll touch on the budget concerns and the political implications.

Making sure to maintain the moral aspects, like the importance of community action vs. government role, and the consequences of budget cuts. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and covers all essential points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy has reignited the debate over the role of government in disaster relief. President Obama emphasized federal support, stating, "America's with you," and promising full federal resources to aid recovery. Romney, while acknowledging the importance of federal efforts, advocates for decentralized disaster relief, preferring local and voluntary actions. He shared a parable about individual responsibility, suggesting that collective small efforts can achieve large goals. Romney has previously argued for reducing federal involvement in disaster relief, prioritizing state and private sector roles. Despite this, Republican Governor Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response as "outstanding." The article highlights the tension between federal intervention and local autonomy, with Romney's past comments on cutting FEMA funding now under scrutiny. Obama will continue to advocate for federal involvement during his tour of storm-affected areas in New Jersey. END OF SUMMARY.
