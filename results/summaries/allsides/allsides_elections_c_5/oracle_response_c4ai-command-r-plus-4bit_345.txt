SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offer help to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, the debate over the role of the government in disaster relief is underscored. While Obama pledges the full resources of the federal government, Romney emphasizes the importance of local government and individual action. During a Republican primary debate last year, Romney argued for decentralizing disaster relief, sending it "back to the states" or "even better, to the private sector." However, Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response, thanking President Obama and FEMA for their personal attention and outstanding efforts. The FEMA budget remains a target for Republicans aiming to reduce federal spending, but Romney has avoided directly addressing FEMA funding during the storm's aftermath. President Obama, on the other hand, is set to tour hard-hit New Jersey, emphasizing the importance of an active federal role in helping states get back on their feet without red tape. This week's storm highlights the moral dilemma of balancing fiscal responsibility with the need to help those affected by disasters, without jeopardizing the future for our children.
