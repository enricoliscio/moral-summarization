SUMMARY:
President Obama offered "thoughts and prayers" as well as the full resources of the federal government to those affected by Sandy, emphasizing that "America's with you" and promising to do everything possible to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, highlighting the "virtue of individual action". Romney's past comments on decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending have sparked debate, with some arguing that it's not the "right direction" to take. However, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, calling it "outstanding". As the debate continues, Obama will make the case for an active federal role, while Romney's stance on FEMA funding remains unclear. END OF SUMMARY.
