SUMMARY: The article discusses the different approaches that President Obama and Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent, have towards the role of the government in disaster relief efforts, in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. Obama emphasizes the importance of a strong federal response, pledging to cut through red tape and provide whatever resources are needed. Romney, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of local governments and even voluntary efforts, citing his high school experience as an example of how individual action can make a difference. However, Romney has also argued for decentralizing disaster relief efforts and sending them back to the states or private sector whenever possible. The article also notes that Republican-led states like Texas and Oklahoma are among the leaders in federal disaster declarations, and that FEMA's budget remains a target for spending cuts by Republicans. Despite this, Romney has avoided questions about FEMA funding and has instead focused on his support for storm victims through a canned food drive. The article concludes by noting that Obama will continue to emphasize the federal government's role in disaster relief by touring hard-hit areas of New Jersey.
