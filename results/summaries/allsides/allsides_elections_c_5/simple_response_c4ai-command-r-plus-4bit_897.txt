SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney offered support and assistance to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, but their responses highlighted their differing views on the role of the government in disaster relief. Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government and emphasized the importance of federal support in helping communities get back on their feet. Romney, meanwhile, sponsored a canned food drive and emphasized the importance of individual and local efforts in disaster relief, reflecting his belief in smaller government and decentralized power. Romney has previously argued for disaster relief to be handled by states or the private sector, but his comments on FEMA funding during the storm have been evasive. The article also notes the political implications of disaster relief, with Republican governors praising the federal response while recognizing the need to reduce federal spending. However, disasters can occur in any state, regardless of political affiliation, underscoring the importance of effective disaster relief beyond partisan politics.
