Okay, I need to summarize this article about Sandy and the debate over the government's role. The user provided the article, so I'll start by reading through it carefully.

The article talks about President Obama and Mitt Romney's responses to Hurricane Sandy. Obama emphasizes federal government assistance, while Romney supports local efforts and the private sector. There's a mention of Romney's canned food drive and his belief in decentralized disaster relief. 

I should note that both candidates are addressing the issue, but their approaches differ. Obama has FEMA involved, and Governor Christie praises the federal response. However, Romney's past comments about cutting FEMA funding are relevant, especially since Sandy is a current event.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Obama's federal support, Romney's local and voluntary approach, Christie's praise, and Romney's past stance on FEMA funding. I'll make sure to mention the contrast between their views and how Sandy highlights this debate.

Let me structure this: start with Obama's response, then Romney's, include Christie's comment, and end with Romney's past remarks on FEMA. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I think that covers the main points without getting too detailed. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the required length.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama emphasized federal government support for Hurricane Sandy victims, stating, "America's with you," and promising full federal resources to aid recovery. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney highlighted local and voluntary efforts, citing the importance of individual action and decentralized disaster relief. Romney's approach contrasts with Obama's focus on federal involvement, though both aim to assist storm-affected communities. Obama has ensured FEMA, led by disaster professional Craig Fugate, is responsive, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praising the federal response. However, Romney's past comments advocating for reduced federal disaster relief funding and increased private-sector involvement remain a point of contention. As Sandy underscores the debate over federal vs. local roles, Obama will continue advocating for federal involvement in disaster recovery.  
END OF SUMMARY.
