Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the debate over the government's role in disaster response, specifically after Hurricane Sandy. President Obama is emphasizing the federal government's role, offering support and resources. He mentions that America is with the affected people and that the government will help them recover.

On the other hand, Republicans, like Mitt Romney, believe in local government and voluntary efforts. Romney organized a food drive and used a story about students cleaning up a football field to illustrate the power of individual action. He argues that disaster relief should be decentralized, moving responsibilities back to states and even the private sector. However, he doesn't say that voluntary efforts alone can replace government action.

The article also mentions that state disaster officials sometimes clash with the federal government, but under Obama, there's been improvement with FEMA led by Craig Fugate, who understands state perspectives. Obama has promised to cut red tape and help recovery efforts. Republican Governor Chris Christie praised the federal response, which is notable since New Jersey is a Democratic stronghold.

Despite this, Republicans, including Romney, want to reduce federal spending. Romney was critical of FEMA's budget in the past, arguing that the government shouldn't be doing things it can't afford. However, he avoided discussing FEMA funding during the food drive. Obama will continue to advocate for federal involvement by touring New Jersey.

So, the key points are: Obama supports federal government's active role in disaster relief, Romney and Republicans prefer local and private efforts, the debate over FEMA's budget, and the current praise for federal response despite political differences.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the main arguments from both parties and the current situation post-Sandy.

President Obama emphasized federal support, offering resources and pledging to help affected areas recover.
