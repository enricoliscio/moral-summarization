Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided specific morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the differing views on government's role in disaster relief between Obama and Romney, using Hurricane Sandy as the backdrop. Obama emphasizes federal government assistance, while Romney advocates for local and voluntary efforts. There are quotes from both candidates and mentions of FEMA's role and budget considerations.

I should focus on including the moral words: prayers, help, cleaning, disaster, send, delivering, attention, relief, borrowing, jeopardizing, ignored. I need to make sure these words are integrated naturally into the summary without making it seem forced.

I'll start by outlining the key points: Obama's federal help, Romney's local efforts, FEMA's efficiency, budget concerns, and Romney's avoidance of questions. Then, I'll craft sentences that include the moral terms, ensuring the summary stays under 200 words.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the contrast between the two approaches and the implications of each. Also, I'll check that all the required words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama emphasized the federal government's role in disaster relief during Hurricane Sandy, offering prayers and tangible help to affected communities. He assured Americans that the government would deliver assistance, standing behind those in need. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney highlighted the virtue of individual action, using a parable about cleaning a football field to illustrate the power of voluntary efforts. Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, advocating for sending responsibilities back to states and the private sector. However, Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response, acknowledging FEMA's effective delivery of aid. Despite this, FEMA's budget remains a target for budget-cutting Republicans, with Romney previously suggesting that federal disaster relief should be scrutinized to avoid borrowing and jeopardizing the future. Romney, however, ignored questions about FEMA funding during a recent event. Obama continues to advocate for an active federal role, touring disaster-hit areas to ensure attention and relief efforts remain focused. END OF SUMMARY.
