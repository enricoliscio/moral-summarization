SUMMARY: President Obama offered thoughts, prayers, and help to those affected by Sandy, pledging the full resources of the federal government. He views the federal government as critical to disaster relief efforts, while Republicans, including Mitt Romney, emphasize the role of local government and voluntary initiatives. Romney previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending. However, during the storm, Romney sponsored a canned food drive and avoided questions about FEMA funding. Obama has promised to streamline the recovery process and keep red tape from hindering progress. FEMA, under the leadership of disaster professional Craig Fugate, has received praise for its response, even from Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. While disasters can occur in any state, the debate over the role of the federal government in disaster relief continues, with Republicans targeting the FEMA budget as a potential area for spending cuts. Obama will tour hard-hit New Jersey to further emphasize the importance of an active federal role in disaster relief. END OF SUMMARY.
