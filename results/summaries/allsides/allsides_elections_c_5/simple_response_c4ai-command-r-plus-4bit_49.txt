SUMMARY: As President Obama and Mitt Romney offer assistance to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, their differing approaches to the role of government in disaster relief are highlighted. Obama pledges the full resources of the federal government, emphasizing its crucial role in helping communities get back on their feet. Romney, meanwhile, emphasizes individual action and local government efforts, recalling a high school story where each student was responsible for cleaning a small section of a football field. Romney's comments during a Republican primary debate last year also reflect his preference for decentralized disaster relief, sending powers back to the states and even the private sector if possible. This stance, however, may be challenged as Republican governors praise the federal response to the storm, with FEMA playing a key role. The FEMA budget remains a target for spending cuts, but the current crisis underscores the importance of a strong federal response in times of disaster. The contrasting approaches of Obama and Romney showcase their opposing views on the role of government in addressing national challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
