SUMMARY:
President Obama and Mitt Romney responded to Superstorm Sandy by offering their thoughts and prayers, as well as tangible assistance, to those affected by the disaster. Their approaches, however, highlight a moral debate over the role of government in disaster relief. Obama promised the full resources of the federal government, seeing it as a critical vehicle for help. Romney, on the other hand, emphasized the virtue of individual action and voluntary efforts, suggesting that disaster relief should be decentralized and handled by local governments or the private sector. While Romney did not outright reject the need for federal involvement, he has previously stated that reducing federal spending is a priority, even in the face of disasters. This moral dilemma is further complicated by the praise given to the federal response by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a state hard-hit by the storm. As the recovery efforts continue, the debate over the appropriate level of government involvement in disaster relief will likely persist, with both sides making moral arguments to support their positions.
