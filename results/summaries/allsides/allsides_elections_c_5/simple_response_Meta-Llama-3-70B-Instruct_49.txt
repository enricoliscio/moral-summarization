SUMMARY:

The devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy has reignited the debate over the government's role in disaster relief. President Obama emphasized the importance of the federal government's support, offering "the full resources of the federal government" to affected areas. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney believe in decentralizing disaster relief, relying more on local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney's past comments, however, have raised concerns about his commitment to FEMA funding. Despite this, even Republican Governor Chris Christie praised the federal response to the disaster. The moral framing of this debate highlights the importance of collective responsibility and the role of government in providing support to those in need. By prioritizing individual action and decentralization, Republicans may be seen as neglecting the vulnerable and favoring a more limited role for government. In contrast, Democrats like Obama are seen as champions of a more active and compassionate government.
