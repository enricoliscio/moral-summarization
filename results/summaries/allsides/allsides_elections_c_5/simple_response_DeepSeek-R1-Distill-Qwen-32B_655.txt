Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sandy and the debate over the government's role. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts with President Obama offering support and federal resources after Sandy. He emphasizes that the federal government is crucial for help. Then it contrasts with Republicans, like Romney, who focus more on local government and voluntary efforts. Romney talked about a high school cleanup story to illustrate the value of individual action. 

I should note that Romney doesn't say voluntary efforts replace government, but in the past, he's argued for decentralizing disaster relief, suggesting states and private sectors handle more. The article mentions that state officials sometimes clash with the federal government, but under Obama, FEMA is managed better with Craig Fugate, who understands state perspectives. Obama also promises to cut red tape.

Gov. Christie, a Republican, praised Obama's federal response, which is interesting because New Jersey leans Democratic. However, Texas and Oklahoma, more Republican states, have a lot of federal disaster declarations, but FEMA's budget is still a target for spending cuts. Romney was asked about cutting disaster relief and said they need to stop doing unnecessary federal things to avoid borrowing too much.

The article ends with Romney avoiding questions about FEMA funding and Obama continuing to advocate for federal involvement by touring New Jersey.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral perspectives: Obama's emphasis on federal help versus Romney's preference for local and private efforts. Also, include the political implications, like Christie's praise despite party lines and the budget debate.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Obama's federal response, Romney's local and voluntary approach, the clash over FEMA funding, Christie's praise, and the ongoing debate on federal role in disasters.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is included without going into too much detail. Make sure to highlight the moral framing by each sideâ€”Obama's active federal role vs. Romney's decentralized approach.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama emphasized the federal government's role in disaster relief after Hurricane Sandy, offering support and resources to affected areas. He stressed that the federal government is a critical tool for helping communities recover. In contrast, Mitt Romney highlighted the importance of local and voluntary efforts, using a personal anecdote to illustrate the value of individual action. Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, suggesting that responsibilities should be shifted to states and the private sector. However, he did not dismiss the need for federal involvement entirely. Despite political differences, Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised Obama's federal response, acknowledging FEMA's effective coordination. The debate over disaster relief funding remains contentious, with Romney previously advocating for cuts to federal programs to reduce borrowing, a stance that contrasts with Obama's emphasis on maintaining an active federal role. Obama continues to advocate for federal involvement, touring disaster-hit areas to underscore this commitment. END OF SUMMARY.
