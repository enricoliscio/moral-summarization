SUMMARY:
President Obama emphasized the importance of the federal government's role in providing aid to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, saying "America's with you" and promising to do everything possible to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, suggesting that it's better to send it back to the states or private sector. However, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, calling it "outstanding" and thanking the president personally. The debate highlights the moral implications of government spending, with Romney previously suggesting that disaster relief could be cut to reduce federal spending, which could be seen as jeopardizing the future for our kids.
