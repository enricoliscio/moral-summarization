SUMMARY: As the United States grapples with the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the disaster has highlighted the ongoing debate over the role of the government in disaster relief. President Obama has pledged the full resources of the federal government to help those affected, while his opponent, Mitt Romney, has emphasized the importance of local government and individual efforts. During the Republican primary debate last year, Romney argued for decentralizing disaster relief and sending it back to the states or private sector. However, in the wake of the storm, Romney has avoided questions about FEMA funding. Obama, on the other hand, has promised to cut through red tape and provide direct support to those in need. The article notes that state disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, but that FEMA director Craig Fugate, a former state emergency agency head, has improved relations. The federal response to Sandy has received praise from Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, who thanked the president for his personal attention. Texas and Oklahoma, both Republican-leaning states, lead the nation in federal disaster declarations. The article concludes by noting that FEMA remains a target for spending cuts by Republicans, despite the crucial role it plays in disaster relief.
END OF SUMMARY.
