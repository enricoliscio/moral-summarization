SUMMARY:
President Obama offered his thoughts, prayers, and tangible resources to those affected by Sandy, promising the full help of the federal government. This underscores the moral debate over the role of government in disaster relief, with Obama favoring a centralized approach while Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney shared a parable about the virtue of individual action and cleaning one's lane, arguing for a decentralized approach to disaster relief during a Republican primary debate. While Romney did not suggest voluntary efforts alone are a substitute for government aid, he targeted the FEMA budget as a potential area for spending cuts to reduce the federal deficit. Obama, meanwhile, has promised to cut through red tape and ensure the federal government delivers the necessary assistance. This moral framing of disaster relief as a responsibility of either centralized or decentralized entities is further highlighted by the praise of Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who thanked President Obama and FEMA for their outstanding response. This disaster has brought to light the moral dilemma of balancing disaster relief with fiscal responsibility, especially as Republican-led states are often hit hard by disasters yet target FEMA budgets as an attractive chopping block. President Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal role in disaster relief during his tour of hard-hit New Jersey. END OF SUMMARY.
