SUMMARY:

President Obama offered "thoughts and prayers" to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney emphasize the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments suggest that he believes disaster relief should be decentralized, with a focus on state and private sector involvement. However, in the wake of Sandy, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response, thanking the president for his "personal attention" to the disaster. Despite this, Romney's previous comments on cutting FEMA funding seem incongruous, as he ignored reporters' questions on the topic. Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal role in disaster relief, highlighting the importance of "delivering" aid and "relief" to those in need. END OF SUMMARY.
