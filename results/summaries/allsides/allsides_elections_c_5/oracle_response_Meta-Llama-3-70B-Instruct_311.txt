SUMMARY:

President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney sponsored a canned food drive and told a parable about the importance of individual responsibility in cleaning up after a disaster. While Romney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone are a substitute for government help, he has previously argued that disaster relief should be decentralized as much as possible. Obama, on the other hand, has promised to keep red tape from getting in the way of recovery, and has delivered on that promise, earning praise from Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. The debate highlights the differing views on the role of government in times of disaster, with Obama emphasizing the importance of federal help and Romney advocating for a more limited role.
