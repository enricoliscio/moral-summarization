Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Sandy and the debate over the government's role in disaster response. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about President Obama offering support and the federal government's resources to those affected by Sandy. He emphasizes that the federal government is crucial for providing help. Then it contrasts this with Republicans, who believe more in local governments and voluntary efforts. Mitt Romney is mentioned as having organized a canned food drive and using a story about students cleaning a football field to illustrate the importance of individual action. However, Romney doesn't say that voluntary efforts should replace government aid entirely. 

The article also mentions that during a Republican debate, Romney argued for decentralizing disaster relief, suggesting that responsibilities should be returned to states and even the private sector. It notes that state disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, but this has been less of an issue recently. Obama has made efforts to streamline FEMA's response, naming a professional to lead it and promising to cut through red tape. 

There's a part where Republican Governor Chris Christie praises the federal response, which is interesting because New Jersey is a Democratic-leaning state. The article also points out that Texas and Oklahoma have many federal disaster declarations, but for Republicans focused on reducing spending, FEMA's budget is a target. Romney was asked about cutting disaster relief funding and said they should stop doing unnecessary federal programs to avoid borrowing more money. However, he didn't address FEMA funding when asked recently. Obama is continuing to advocate for federal involvement by touring affected areas.

So, the main points are:

1. Obama emphasizes federal government's role in disaster response.
2. Romney and Republicans prefer local and voluntary efforts, but acknowledge federal help.
3. Romney's past comments on decentralizing disaster relief and cutting federal spending.
4. Recent praise from Christie for federal response.
5. FEMA's budget is a target for spending cuts, but Romney avoided the topic recently.
6. Obama is promoting federal involvement through his actions.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the debate between Obama and Romney's approaches, their arguments, and the current situation with FEMA and Christie's comments.

I should structure it by introducing the debate, then detailing each side's stance, mention Romney's past comments, Christie's praise, and conclude with Obama's ongoing advocacy for federal involvement.

Let me make sure I include all key points without going over the word limit. I'll need to be concise, using phrases like "President Obama emphasizes federal government's role," "Romney prefers local efforts," etc. Also, mention the budget concerns and Romney's recent avoidance of the topic.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."
