SUMMARY:
President Obama emphasized the importance of the federal government's role in disaster relief, offering "thoughts and prayers" as well as tangible resources to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the "virtue of individual action." Romney's past statements suggest that he believes disaster relief should be decentralized and that the federal government should focus on what is "critical" and "right." However, in the wake of Sandy, even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praised the federal response as "outstanding" and thanked the president for his "personal attention." Despite this, Romney's previous comments about cutting FEMA funding remain an "attractive target" for those seeking to reduce federal spending. President Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal role in disaster relief. END OF SUMMARY.
