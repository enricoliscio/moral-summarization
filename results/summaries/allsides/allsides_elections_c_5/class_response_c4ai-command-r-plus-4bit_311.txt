SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney offered help and prayers to those affected by Sandy, but their approaches to disaster relief differ. Obama sees the federal government as a critical vehicle for providing assistance, while Republicans like Romney emphasize the role of local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney previously argued that disaster relief should be decentralized, sending power and resources to states and the private sector. This position reflects a broader Republican goal of reducing federal spending. However, the FEMA budget remains a target for spending cuts, even as FEMA plays a crucial role in disaster relief. Romney has avoided questions about FEMA funding. Obama has promised a red-tape-free recovery process and will personally tour hard-hit New Jersey to emphasize the importance of an active federal role in disaster relief. The article highlights the moral framing of disaster relief and the differing approaches of the two candidates, with Obama favoring centralized federal assistance and Romney leaning towards decentralization and local efforts.
