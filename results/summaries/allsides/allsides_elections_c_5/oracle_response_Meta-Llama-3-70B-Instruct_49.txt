SUMMARY:

President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney sponsored a canned food drive and told a parable about the importance of individual responsibility, but did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone are a substitute for government help. Obama, on the other hand, has promised to keep red tape from getting in the way of recovery, and has delivered on that promise, with even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praising the federal response. Romney's past comments about reducing federal spending, including disaster relief, seem out of touch in light of the storm. Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal role, touring hard-hit New Jersey on Wednesday. END OF SUMMARY.
