SUMMARY:
President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to help them recover. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney believe in a more decentralized approach, relying on local government and voluntary efforts. Romney even argued that disaster relief should be sent back to the states or private sector whenever possible. However, in the wake of Sandy, Obama's administration has been praised for its swift and effective response, with even Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey thanking the president personally for his attention. Romney's previous comments on cutting FEMA funding seem incongruous with the current situation, highlighting the importance of a strong federal role in disaster relief. Obama will continue to make the case for an active federal government as he tours hard-hit New Jersey.
END OF SUMMARY.
