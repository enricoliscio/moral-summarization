SUMMARY:

President Obama offered his "thoughts and prayers" to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to "help" them get back on their feet. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney emphasize the role of local government and voluntary efforts, citing the virtue of individual action. Romney's past comments, however, have suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized, and that the federal budget for FEMA is a target for reduction. This stance is inconvenient in light of the current disaster, and Romney ignored questions about FEMA funding at a recent event. Meanwhile, Obama has "named" a disaster professional to head FEMA, and has promised to "keep" red tape from hindering recovery. So far, the federal government seems to be "delivering", with even Republican Gov. Chris Christie praising the administration's response. As Obama continues to make the case for an active federal role, the debate over government's role in disaster relief remains a key issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
