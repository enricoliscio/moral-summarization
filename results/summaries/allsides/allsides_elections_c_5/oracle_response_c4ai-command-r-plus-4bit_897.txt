SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney responded to Sandy, each offering thoughts and prayers for those affected and pledging assistance. Obama emphasized the role of the federal government in providing help, while Romney highlighted the importance of individual and local efforts. Romney previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief during a Republican primary debate, suggesting that sending responsibilities to the states or private sector is preferable to federal involvement. However, in light of the storm, his comments on FEMA funding have become inconvenient. Obama has promised to cut through red tape and ensure that governors and mayors receive the assistance they need. The federal government's response has earned praise from Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who thanked the president and FEMA for their outstanding efforts. While Texas and Oklahoma lead in federal disaster declarations, Republicans still target the FEMA budget as a source of spending reduction. Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal role in disaster relief as he tours hard-hit New Jersey.
END OF SUMMARY.
