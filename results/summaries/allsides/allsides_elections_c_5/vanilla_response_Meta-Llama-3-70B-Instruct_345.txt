SUMMARY:

President Obama has pledged the full resources of the federal government to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have historically advocated for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief, relying on local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney has previously suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized as much as possible, and even considered cutting FEMA funding to reduce federal spending. However, in the wake of Sandy, Romney has focused on individual efforts, such as a canned food drive, and has not addressed his previous comments on FEMA funding. Meanwhile, Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response to the disaster, thanking President Obama for his personal attention. The differing approaches to disaster relief highlight a key debate in the presidential campaign.
