SUMMARY:
President Obama offered his thoughts, prayers, and tangible support to those affected by Superstorm Sandy, pledging the full resources of the federal government to help in the recovery effort. Obama views the federal government as a critical vehicle for providing aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, place more faith in local government and voluntary efforts. Romney shared a parable about the virtue of individual action and taking responsibility for one's lane during a canned food drive for storm victims. While Romney recognizes the importance of disaster relief, he has argued for decentralizing it as much as possible, sending it "back to the states" or even the private sector. FEMA, under Obama's leadership, has improved its relationship with state disaster officials, with FEMA director Craig Fugate understanding the states' perspective. Obama has promised to cut through red tape and personally ensure that governors and mayors receive the assistance they need. So far, the federal government's response to Sandy has been praised by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who thanked the president for his personal attention and FEMA for their outstanding work. However, FEMA's budget remains a target for Republicans seeking to reduce federal spending, with Romney suggesting that disaster relief could jeopardize the future of America's children if it adds to the national debt. Obama will continue to advocate for an active federal role in disaster response as he tours hard-hit areas in New Jersey.
