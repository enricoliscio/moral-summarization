SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney offered their help and prayers to those affected by Sandy, but their approaches to disaster relief differ significantly. Obama emphasizes the role of the federal government in providing assistance, while Romney leans towards local government and voluntary efforts. Romney previously argued that disaster relief should be decentralized and that private sector involvement is preferable to federal intervention. This stance may be inconvenient in light of the week's storm, as FEMA's budget is an attractive target for Republicans aiming to reduce federal spending. However, disaster relief is a complex issue, and state disaster officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government. Obama has promised to cut through red tape and provide direct assistance to those in need. Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey praised the federal response, thanking Obama and FEMA for their personal attention and outstanding support. The article highlights the differing approaches to disaster relief and the moral implications of government involvement. END OF SUMMARY.
