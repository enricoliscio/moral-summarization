Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the federal government's role in providing help and relief. He used words like "prayers," "help," "relief," and "delivering." On the other hand, Mitt Romney is highlighted for his belief in local efforts and voluntary actions, using terms like "cleaning" and "send." There's a contrast between the two parties' approaches to disaster management.

I should make sure to include the key morally charged words: prayers, help, cleaning, disaster, send, delivering, attention, relief, borrowing, jeopardizing, ignored. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective presented in the article.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama's federal response, Romney's focus on local efforts, the clash between federal and state roles, FEMA's effectiveness, and Romney's past comments on federal spending. I need to weave in the moral terms naturally.

Let me structure the summary to first mention Obama's approach, then Romney's, followed by the effectiveness of federal efforts and the fiscal concerns. I'll ensure each morally framed word is appropriately placed without forcing them in.

I should also check the word count to stay within the limit. Maybe start with Obama's response, then contrast with Romney, mention FEMA's role, and touch on Romney's past statements about borrowing and jeopardizing. Finally, conclude with the ongoing debate.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced. I'll need to balance the content to cover all aspects succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Obama emphasized the federal government's role in disaster relief during Hurricane Sandy, offering "prayers" and "help" to affected communities. He underscored the importance of federal resources, stating, "America's with you," and promising to "deliver" aid. In contrast, Mitt Romney highlighted local and voluntary efforts, using a parable about "cleaning" a football field to illustrate the virtue of individual action. Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief, advocating to "send" responsibilities back to states and the private sector. However, recent federal efforts, led by FEMA, have been praised by even Republican officials like Gov. Chris Christie. Romney avoided discussing FEMA funding during a recent event, while Obama continues to advocate for an active federal role. Romney's past comments about reducing federal spending, including disaster relief, have come under scrutiny, as he has warned against "borrowing" excessively and "jeopardizing" the future. The storm has reignited the debate over the appropriate scope of federal involvement in disaster response. END OF SUMMARY.
