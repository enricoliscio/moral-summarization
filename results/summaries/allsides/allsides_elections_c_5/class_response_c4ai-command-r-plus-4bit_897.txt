SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney have differing views on the role of the government in providing disaster relief, with Obama favoring a more centralized approach and Romney advocating for decentralization and individual action. While both offer thoughts and prayers for those affected by Sandy, they differ in their beliefs about how best to help. Obama pledges the full resources of the federal government, promising to cut through red tape and personally ensure that states receive the assistance they need. Romney, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of local government and voluntary efforts, such as sponsoring a canned food drive for storm victims. Romney's comments during a Republican primary debate last year suggest that he views disaster relief as an area where the federal government should reduce spending and send responsibilities back to the states or private sector. However, in light of the recent storm, his stance on FEMA funding remains unclear as he ignored questions on the topic. The article also highlights the praise given to the federal response by Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who expressed gratitude for the personal attention and outstanding support provided by the Obama administration and FEMA. The disaster underscores the ongoing debate over the appropriate level of government involvement in disaster relief, with Texas and Oklahoma, both disaster-prone states, leading the nation in federal disaster declarations.
