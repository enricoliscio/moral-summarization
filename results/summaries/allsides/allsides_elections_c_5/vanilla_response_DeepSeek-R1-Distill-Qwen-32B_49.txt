Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the debate over the government's role in disaster relief, specifically after Sandy. The article contrasts Obama's approach with Romney's.

First, I'll read through the article to identify key points. Obama emphasizes federal government involvement, offering help and resources. Romney, on the other hand, focuses on local efforts and the private sector, citing his high school example. There's also mention of Romney's past comments about decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending.

I should note the differing views: Obama supports federal intervention, while Romney prefers state and local initiatives. Also, the article mentions that state officials have sometimes clashed with the federal government, but under Obama, FEMA is more efficient. Governor Christie praises the federal response, even though New Jersey leans Democratic.

Romney's stance on FEMA's budget is importantâ€”Republicans want to cut federal spending, but this might be problematic during disasters. Romney avoided discussing FEMA funding recently, and Obama is touring affected areas to highlight federal aid.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the debate, then outline each candidate's position, mention the efficient federal response, Christie's praise, Romney's past comments, and the political implications of their stances.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the contrast between Obama and Romney, the effectiveness of the federal response, and the political context surrounding disaster relief funding.

SUMMARY: The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy has reignited the debate over the role of government in disaster relief. President Obama emphasized federal support, offering resources and stating, "America's with you," while Mitt Romney highlighted local and voluntary efforts, citing the importance of individual action. Romney has previously argued for decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal involvement, though he recently avoided discussing FEMA funding. Obama, in contrast, has promised streamlined federal aid, with FEMA director Craig Fugate coordinating effectively. Republican Governor Chris Christie praised the federal response, despite New Jersey's Democratic leanings. Romney's stance on cutting federal spending, including FEMA's budget, faces scrutiny as Sandy's impact highlights the need for federal assistance. Obama will continue advocating for federal involvement during his tour of New Jersey. END OF SUMMARY.
