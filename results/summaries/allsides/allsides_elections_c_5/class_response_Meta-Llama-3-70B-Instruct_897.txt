SUMMARY:

President Obama offered "thoughts and prayers" to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, promising the full resources of the federal government to "help" them recover. In contrast, Republicans like Mitt Romney put more faith in local government and voluntary efforts, highlighting the virtue of individual action. Romney sponsored a canned food drive, emphasizing the importance of "cleaning" one's own "lane" to contribute to the larger effort. However, Romney has previously suggested that disaster relief should be decentralized, and that the federal government's role should be reduced. This stance is at odds with Obama's commitment to an active federal role in providing "relief" and "attention" to those in need. While Romney ignored questions about FEMA funding, Obama has promised to "deliver" aid without bureaucratic "red tape" getting in the way. The president's approach has earned praise from Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who thanked Obama for his "personal attention" to the crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
