SUMMARY:

President Obama has offered the full resources of the federal government to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing the importance of government aid in times of crisis. In contrast, Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have historically advocated for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief, relying on local governments and voluntary efforts. Romney has previously suggested that disaster relief should be sent back to the states and even the private sector, and has questioned the necessity of federal funding for FEMA. However, in the wake of Sandy, Romney has not addressed questions about FEMA funding, and Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has praised the federal response to the disaster. The differing views on the role of government in disaster relief highlight a key debate in the presidential election.
