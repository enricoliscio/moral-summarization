SUMMARY: President Obama and Mitt Romney respond differently to the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, highlighting their contrasting views on the role of the government in disaster relief. Obama pledges the full support of the federal government, emphasizing its crucial role in aiding affected communities and individuals. Romney, on the other hand, emphasizes local government and individual efforts, recalling a high school story where students cleaned a football field. Romney's previous statements during a Republican primary debate advocated for decentralizing disaster relief and reducing federal spending, targeting the FEMA budget. However, in light of the storm, his comments may be seen as inconvenient. Obama promises to cut through red tape and ensure direct access to him for governors and mayors facing obstacles in the federal system. The article concludes by noting that disaster-prone states like Texas and Oklahoma are reliably Democratic, highlighting the moral dilemma between federal aid and state autonomy in the face of natural disasters.
