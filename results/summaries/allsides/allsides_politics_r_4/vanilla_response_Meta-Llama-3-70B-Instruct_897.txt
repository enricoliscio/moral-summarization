SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Donald Trump was not indicted alongside his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. The reason is that the US Justice Department has a policy of not indicting a sitting president. This means Trump will serve out his term under the specter of prison. The article argues that Trump's defenders are cult-like in their willingness to believe whatever it takes to remain faithful to him, despite his associations with criminals. Five of his associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes. The article suggests that Trump's history of lying and his fondness for employing people of felonious character make it unlikely that he was unaware of Cohen's actions. The author concludes that Tuesday was a bad day for the president and the country, and that the worst is yet to come.
