Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article begins with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees bearing good and evil fruit, respectively. That sets a moral tone right away. The main point is about why the U.S. president wasn't indicted, suggesting it's because of his position, not innocence. The author implies that Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator, governed by people with criminal ties, which is a moral failing.

The article mentions Trump's associates being convicted or pleading guilty, showing a pattern of corruption. It also contrasts Trump with Obama, highlighting the moral integrity of the latter. The author uses strong language to criticize Trump's defenders as cult-like, unwilling to question their loyalty despite evidence. The summary needs to capture these moral judgments without losing the essence.

I should focus on the key points: the president's exemption from indictment, the implication of his guilt, the corrupt associates, and the contrast with Obama. Also, the use of the tree metaphor to highlight the moral decay. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll condense each section, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I'll start with the quote, then explain the exemption, mention the associates, the defenders' loyalty, and end with the contrast to Obama. I'll make sure to include the moral implications throughout the summary.

The author condemns Trump's defenders as cult-like, ignoring evidence of wrongdoing.
