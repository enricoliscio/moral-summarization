SUMMARY:
The United States is facing an unprecedented situation with a president implicated in a crime but not indicted due to a technicality. The article argues that Donald Trump's association with criminals and his own questionable character raise serious moral concerns about his presidency. His defenders are described as cult-like in their willingness to ignore his potential involvement in campaign finance violations and association with felonious characters. The article highlights Trump's discomfort with people of firm probity and his animus towards Barack Obama, whose administration was free of corruption allegations. Despite Trump's denials, the actions of his associates and his own lies suggest a pattern of corruption and scandal. The conviction of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, with ties to Russian interests, further underscores the moral decay within Trump's circle. The nation is left wondering how much worse the situation will get under Trump's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
