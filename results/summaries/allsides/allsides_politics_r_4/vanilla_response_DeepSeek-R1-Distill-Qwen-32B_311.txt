Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article starts with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees, which probably relates to the main topic. 

The article talks about why the U.S. president wasn't indicted, mentioning that it's because of his position, not innocence. It explains that the Justice Department doesn't indict sitting presidents. The president in question is Donald Trump, and his lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty. 

The summary should include that Trump isn't being indicted now but could face charges later. His defenders downplay the crimes, like campaign finance violations, and ignore connections to Russia. They also mention Trump's history of hiring people with criminal backgrounds, like Cohen and Manafort. 

The article contrasts Trump with Obama, who didn't have such issues. It also points out that Trump's associates have been convicted, showing a pattern of corruption. The conclusion is that the worst might be yet to come.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures these key points clearly. I'll structure it by first stating the reason for no indictment, then mention Trump's associates' crimes, his defenders' reactions, the comparison to Obama, and the implication of a corrupt administration.

SUMMARY: The article discusses why the U.S. president, Donald Trump, was not indicted despite his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. The reason is not because Trump is considered innocent but due to the Justice Department's policy exempting sitting presidents from indictment. Trump's associates, including Cohen and Paul Manafort, have been implicated in crimes, raising concerns about his administration's integrity. Trump's defenders downplay these issues, often ignoring evidence of wrongdoing. The article contrasts Trump's fondness for hiring individuals with criminal backgrounds with former President Barack Obama's administration, which faced no credible corruption allegations. The piece concludes that the worst may still be ahead, as Trump's administration continues to be marked by associations with individuals of questionable character. END OF SUMMARY.
