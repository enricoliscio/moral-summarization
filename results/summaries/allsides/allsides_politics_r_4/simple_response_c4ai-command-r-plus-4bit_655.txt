SUMMARY: The United States is facing an unprecedented situation with a president who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal case. While Donald Trump has not been indicted due to his position as a sitting president, his close associate, Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, implicating Trump. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and dismiss any connection to Russia. However, the facts speak for themselves: Trump has surrounded himself with criminals and people of questionable character, while showing disdain for those with firm probity, such as James Comey, Robert Mueller, and Rod Rosenstein. The president has a history of lying and has been implicated in paying hush money to conceal alleged sexual encounters. His former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of multiple felonies and had extensive ties to Russian interests. The nation is left wondering how much worse things will get under Trump's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
