SUMMARY: Despite not being indicted due to his position as President of the United States, Donald Trump remains implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Cohen paid hush money to two women to keep them from making public their alleged affairs with Trump. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and distance him from any connections to Russia. However, five of Trump's associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty, indicating his comfort in associating with criminals. The article also highlights Trump's disdain for people of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, and his preference for individuals with felonious character. Manafort's conviction on eight felony counts, despite his extensive ties to Russian businesses and debts to them, further reflects poorly on Trump's judgment. The situation with Cohen and Manafort underscores the corruption surrounding Trump's presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
