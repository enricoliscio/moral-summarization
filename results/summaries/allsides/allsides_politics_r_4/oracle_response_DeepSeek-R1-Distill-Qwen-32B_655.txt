Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with a quote from Matthew 7:17 about good and corrupt trees producing good and evil fruits. It then discusses why the US president wasn't indicted, suggesting it's because of his office, not innocence. The Justice Department's policy is mentioned, allowing indictment only after leaving office. The author points out that Trump is governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, with his associates committing crimes. Trump's defenders downplay the crimes, and the article criticizes their loyalty. It also mentions Trump's preference for associates with criminal backgrounds and his discomfort with those of integrity. The article concludes that the worst is yet to come under Trump's leadership.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I should focus on the key moral points: Trump's exemption from indictment, his associates' crimes, his defenders' loyalty, his preference for dishonest associates, and the implication of his governance.

I'll structure the summary to touch on each of these points succinctly, using the specified words. I'll ensure the flow logically moves from the indictment exemption to the consequences of his governance.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and stays within the word limit.

The article uses the metaphor of a "corrupt tree" to critique President Trump's governance. Despite his associates being indicted for crimes, including campaign finance violations and ties to Russia, Trump remains exempt from indictment due to his presidency. His defenders, described as cult-like, dismiss these crimes, preferring loyalty over accountability. Trump's preference for associates with criminal backgrounds, such as Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, contrasts with his discomfort towards those of integrity, like Robert Mueller. The article warns that Trump's administration, governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, signals worse to come, as his leadership is marked by lies, financial misconduct, and ties to pro-Russian interests.
