SUMMARY: There is a stench of corruption emanating from the highest office in the land. Even if Donald Trump was not indicted for campaign finance violations, his longtime associate Michael Cohen's guilty plea implicates him as an unindicted co-conspirator. Trump's defenders attempt to downplay the significance of these crimes and ignore the foul fruit of his corrupt tree. Trump is comfortable with criminals and has employed people of felonious character, with five associates being convicted or pleading guilty. His disdain for people of firm probity is evident, and his lies have been exposed. The president is implicated in campaign finance crimes, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of eight felonies with ties to Russian interests. Trump's willingness to associate with the corrupt and his defenders' cult-like devotion paint a grim picture of the moral decay at the heart of the administration. The country now faces the prospect of being administered by an unindicted co-conspirator, with the worst yet to come. END OF SUMMARY.
