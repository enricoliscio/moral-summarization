SUMMARY:
The article argues that President Trump is a "corrupt tree" that brings forth "evil fruit." Despite his lawyer's guilty plea, Trump was not indicted due to his presidential immunity. However, this means he will serve the remainder of his term under the "specter of prison." The nation is being governed by an "unindicted co-conspirator." Trump's defenders are described as "cultlike" and "slavish" in their willingness to believe whatever it takes to remain faithful. The article highlights Trump's fondness for employing people of "felonious character," with five associates convicted or pleaded guilty. It concludes that the worst is yet to come, and Tuesday's events were a "bad day" for the president and the country. END OF SUMMARY.
