Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees bearing good and evil fruit, respectively. It then discusses why the U.S. president wasn't indicted, suggesting it's because of his position. The author points out that the Justice Department's policy exempts sitting presidents from indictment, so Trump won't face charges while in office. This creates a situation where the country is led by someone implicated in crimes by associates.

The article criticizes Trump's defenders for ignoring the significance of Cohen's plea and the lack of Russia ties. It compares their loyalty to a cult, highlighting their unwavering support despite evidence. The author mentions Trump's tendency to surround himself with people of questionable character, noting that five associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty. In contrast, Obama's administration had no major corruption allegations.

The article also discusses Trump's lies, such as denying knowledge of payments to Stormy Daniels and admitting to reimbursing Cohen. Manafort's convictions are mentioned, with Trump downplaying their relevance to Russia, though Manafort had ties to pro-Russian interests. The author implies Trump might have been aware of Manafort's financial issues, which could have given foreign interests leverage.

The summary needs to capture these points, emphasizing the moral issues and the corrupt environment Trump has fostered. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear, highlighting the implications of Trump's associates' actions and his own behavior.
