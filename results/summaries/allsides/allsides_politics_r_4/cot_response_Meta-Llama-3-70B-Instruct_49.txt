SUMMARY:
The US Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president has allowed Donald Trump to escape prosecution, despite being implicated in a crime by his close associate Michael Cohen. Trump's defenders are described as "cultlike" in their fervent willingness to believe whatever they need to, ignoring the "noxious" products of a "corrupt tree". Five of Trump's associates have been convicted of crimes or pleaded guilty, and his fondness for employing people of "felonious" character is unmatched in presidential history. Trump's lies and attempts to discredit those with "probity", such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, further erode trust. The nation is being governed by an "unindicted co-conspirator", and the worst may be yet to come. END OF SUMMARY.
