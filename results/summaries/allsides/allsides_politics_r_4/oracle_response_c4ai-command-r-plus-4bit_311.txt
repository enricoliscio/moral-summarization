SUMMARY: Despite the evidence of wrongdoing, the US President remains unindicted due to a Justice Department policy exempting sitting presidents from indictment. This leaves Americans living under an administration implicated in crimes, with the President as an unindicted co-conspirator. While defenders downplay the significance of campaign finance violations admitted by his longtime lawyer, five associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty. Trump surrounds himself with criminals and is uncomfortable around the upright. He lies and denies, only admitting the truth when exposed. His former campaign manager, Manafort, was convicted of eight felonies with ties to Russian interests, yet Trump allowed him to run the campaign unpaid. The worst may be yet to come for a President surrounded by the noxious fruit of a corrupt tree.
END OF SUMMARY.
