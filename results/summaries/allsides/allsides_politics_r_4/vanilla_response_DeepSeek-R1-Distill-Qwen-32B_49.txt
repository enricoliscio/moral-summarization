Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article starts with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees, which probably sets the tone for discussing the current president's situation. 

The main point seems to be that the U.S. Justice Department doesn't indict sitting presidents, so Trump isn't being charged now. But he's implicated through his associates, like Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty. The article mentions that Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these crimes, especially not connecting them to Russia. They also talk about how Trump surrounds himself with people of questionable character, like Manafort and Flynn, who have been convicted or had issues.

The article criticizes Trump's lack of integrity, pointing out his lies, such as denying knowledge of payments to Stormy Daniels. It also contrasts him with Obama, who didn't have such issues. The conclusion is that the worst might be yet to come for Trump and the country.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's exemption from indictment, his associates' crimes, his defenders' stance, his association with felons, lies, and the contrast with Obama. Also, the implication that more issues may arise.
