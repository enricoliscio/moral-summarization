Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article starts with a Bible quote, which sets a tone about good and corrupt trees bearing good and evil fruit. That's a key moral element I should include.

The main points are about the U.S. President not being indicted because of his position, and how his associates have been implicated in crimes. The author uses strong language to criticize Trump's defenders as cult-like, which is an important moral judgment to highlight.

I should mention the policy that sitting presidents can't be indicted, Trump's associates' convictions, and the implication that Trump might be involved in felonies. Also, the contrast between Trump and Obama is a moral point about integrity.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well, capturing the essence of the original text's moral stance without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: The article draws a moral parallel between a corrupt tree bearing evil fruit and the presidency of Donald Trump, arguing that his administration is governed by individuals implicated in criminal activity. The U.S. Justice Department’s policy of exempting sitting presidents from indictment means Trump may avoid charges while in office, despite being linked to felonies through associates like Michael Cohen. Trump’s defenders are criticized for their cult-like loyalty, ignoring the implications of his associates’ crimes. The article highlights Trump’s preference for associates of questionable character, contrasting him with Obama, whose administration lacked such corruption. It questions whether Trump was unaware of Cohen’s illegal actions, noting his history of deceit. The author warns that the worst may yet come, underscoring the moral decay of the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
