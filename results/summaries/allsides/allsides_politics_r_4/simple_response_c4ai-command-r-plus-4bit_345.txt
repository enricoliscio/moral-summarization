SUMMARY: The Justice Department's policy of exempting sitting presidents from indictment means that Donald Trump, an unindicted co-conspirator, will likely serve the remainder of his term, despite being implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and ignore the president's association with multiple convicted criminals, choosing instead to remain faithful to him. Trump surrounds himself with people of questionable character, and his discomfort with those of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, is well-known. The conviction of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, on eight felony counts, highlights Trump's questionable judgment and possible connections to pro-Russian interests. Tuesday's developments are a blot on the country and Trump's presidency, and the worst may be yet to come.
END OF SUMMARY.
