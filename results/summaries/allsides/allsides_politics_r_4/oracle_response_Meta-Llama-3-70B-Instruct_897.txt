SUMMARY: The president of the United States has been implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Despite this, the president will not be indicted due to the U.S. Justice Department's policy of exempting sitting presidents from indictment. This means that the president will serve the remainder of his term under the specter of prison, effectively governing the nation as an unindicted co-conspirator. The author argues that the president's defenders are cultlike in their fervent willingness to believe whatever they have to believe to remain faithful, even when faced with evidence of the president's guilt. The president has shown a fondness for employing people of felonious character, with five of his associates having been convicted of crimes or pleaded guilty. The author concludes that the worst is yet to come, given the president's history of lies and corruption. END OF SUMMARY.
