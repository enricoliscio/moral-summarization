SUMMARY: Even a good tree can bring forth bad fruit, and the same is true of a corrupt tree bearing good fruit. This is the case with the recent indictment of the president's longtime personal lawyer, where the president was not indicted due to his position, not because he is innocent. The Justice Department's policy spares the president from indictment, but it does not change the fact that he is implicated in a crime and may be guilty of felonies. Trump's defenders downplay the campaign finance violations and Russia connections, choosing to believe whatever they need to remain faithful. Trump surrounds himself with criminals and felons, with five associates convicted or pleaded guilty so far. He is uncomfortable around people of firm probity, such as James Comey, Robert Mueller, and Rod Rosenstein. The president lies and tries to distance himself from payments to Stormy Daniels, only to later admit and reimburse the payments. Trump's former campaign manager, Manafort, was convicted of eight felonies, with ties to Russian interests and financial troubles that gave them leverage. Tuesday's events were a blow to the president and the country, and more troubles are expected.
END OF SUMMARY.
