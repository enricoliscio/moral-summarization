SUMMARY:

The article argues that President Trump's exemption from indictment due to his presidential status is a moral outrage. Despite his lawyer Michael Cohen's guilty plea, Trump remains unindicted, implying that he is above the law. The author likens Trump's defenders to a cult, willing to believe anything to remain faithful, and notes that Trump has a history of surrounding himself with criminals. Five of his associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty, while he has shown discomfort with people of strong moral character. The article suggests that Trump's lies and corruption are evident, and that his presidency is a corrupt tree bearing evil fruit. The author concludes that Tuesday's events were a bad day for the president and the country, but warns that the worst is yet to come.
