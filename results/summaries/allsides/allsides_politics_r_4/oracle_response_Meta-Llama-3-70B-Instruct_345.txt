SUMMARY: The US Justice Department's policy exempts a sitting president from indictment, allowing Donald Trump to serve out his term under the specter of prison. Despite his lawyer Michael Cohen's guilty plea, Trump's defenders refuse to acknowledge his implication in a crime, instead deprecating the importance of campaign finance violations. They would rather "eat the foul fruit‚Äù than recognize the corrupt nature of the tree. Trump has a fondness for employing people of felonious character, with five associates convicted or pleading guilty. He is uncomfortable with people of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, who have served with integrity. Trump's history of lies and corruption makes it unlikely that Cohen committed crimes without his knowledge or approval. The nation is being governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, and the worst is yet to come. END OF SUMMARY.
