SUMMARY: Tuesday was a bad day for the United States. The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was not indicted on campaign finance violations to which his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty, not because he is innocent, but because of a Justice Department policy that exempts sitting presidents from indictment. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and the fact that five of Trump's associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes, instead choosing to remain loyal to a president who surrounds himself with criminals and attacks those of firm probity. The worst may still be yet to come for Trump and the country. END OF SUMMARY.
