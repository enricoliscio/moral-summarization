SUMMARY:

The article argues that President Trump's exemption from indictment due to his position is a double standard, implying that he is guilty of a crime but will not face consequences until he leaves office. This creates a situation where the nation is being governed by an "unindicted co-conspirator." The author criticizes Trump's defenders for downplaying the significance of campaign finance violations and ignoring the pattern of criminal behavior among his associates. The article highlights Trump's fondness for surrounding himself with people of questionable character, including five associates who have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes. In contrast, people of strong moral character, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, make Trump uncomfortable. The author concludes that Trump's history of lying and surrounding himself with corrupt individuals suggests that the worst is yet to come.
