SUMMARY:
The US Justice Department's policy exempts a sitting president from indictment, implying that Donald Trump will serve the remainder of his term under the specter of prison. Trump's defenders downplay the importance of campaign finance violations, but the president has been implicated in a crime by his close associate Michael Cohen. Trump's fondness for employing people of felonious character is unprecedented, with five associates convicted of crimes or pleading guilty. His discomfort with people of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, is notable. Trump's history of lies and corruption suggests that the worst is yet to come. The nation is being governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, and the corrupt tree is bearing foul fruit. END OF SUMMARY.
