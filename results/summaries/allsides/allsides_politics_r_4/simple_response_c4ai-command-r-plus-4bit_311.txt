SUMMARY: The United States is facing an unprecedented situation with a president who has been implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, and may eventually be revealed as guilty of felonies. Despite this, Donald Trump's defenders remain fervent in their support, refusing to acknowledge the moral corruption at the heart of his administration. Trump has surrounded himself with people of questionable character, with five associates convicted or pleading guilty to crimes, while those of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, have been treated with animus and dismissed. The recent conviction of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, on eight felony counts, raises questions about Trump's judgment and possible connections to pro-Russian interests. The nation is witnessing the consequences of a corrupt tree bearing foul fruit, and the worst may still be ahead. 

END OF SUMMARY.
