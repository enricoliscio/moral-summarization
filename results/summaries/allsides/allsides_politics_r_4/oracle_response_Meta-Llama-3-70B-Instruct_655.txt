SUMMARY: The US Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president has allowed Donald Trump to avoid criminal charges, despite his implication in a crime by his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen. This means Trump will serve out his term under the specter of prison, making the nation vulnerable to being governed by an unindicted co-conspirator. Trump's defenders downplay the importance of campaign finance violations, but the president's history of surrounding himself with criminals and telling lies suggests otherwise. Five of his associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty, and Trump's animus towards those who uphold the law, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, is well-documented. The president's fondness for employing people of felonious character and his refusal to acknowledge the truth raises serious concerns about his fitness for office. As the worst is yet to come, it's essential to recognize the corrupt tree that is Trump's administration. END OF SUMMARY.
