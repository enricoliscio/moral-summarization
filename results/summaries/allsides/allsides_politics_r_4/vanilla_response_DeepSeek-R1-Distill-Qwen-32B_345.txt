Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article starts with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees, then talks about why the U.S. president wasn't indicted. It mentions that the Justice Department doesn't indict sitting presidents, so Trump isn't facing charges while in office. The author points out that Trump's associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty, which implies his involvement. The article also discusses Trump's defenders who downplay the significance of these crimes and compares his administration to Obama's, highlighting the lack of corruption there. It ends by suggesting that the worst is yet to come.

I need to capture the main points: Trump's exemption from indictment, the implication of his guilt through associates, his defenders' stance, comparison to Obama, and the overall negative outlook. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. I'll make sure to mention the key individuals like Cohen, Manafort, and the Justice Department's policy. Also, highlight the contrast between Trump's administration and Obama's to emphasize the corruption issue.

SUMMARY: The article discusses why U.S. President Donald Trump was not indicted in the same case that led to his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. The U.S. Justice Department's policy exempts sitting presidents from indictment, meaning Trump could remain in office despite being implicated in criminal activity. The article highlights Trump's association with individuals convicted or charged with crimes, suggesting his potential involvement. His defenders downplay the significance of these crimes, often displaying cult-like loyalty. The piece contrasts Trump's administration with former President Barack Obama's, noting the lack of corruption in Obama's tenure. The article concludes that the worst may still be coming for Trump and the country. END OF SUMMARY.
