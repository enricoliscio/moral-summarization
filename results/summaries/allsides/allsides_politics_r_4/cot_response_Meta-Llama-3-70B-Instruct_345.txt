SUMMARY:
The US Justice Department's policy exempts a sitting president from indictment, allowing Donald Trump to serve out his term under the specter of prison. Despite his implication in a crime by his close associate Michael Cohen, Trump's defenders remain fervent and cultlike in their support. However, the nation is being governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, with a history of employing people of felonious character. Trump's corrupt tree has borne noxious fruit, including five associates convicted of crimes or pleading guilty. His lies and animus towards people of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, further erode trust. The worst may be yet to come from this corrupt administration. END OF SUMMARY.
