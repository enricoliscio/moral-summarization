Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary must maintain the ethical tone and key terms used by the author. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump not being indicted despite his lawyer's guilty plea, the implications of this, and the moral issues surrounding his associates and his presidency. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to include those words in the summary.

I should identify the key moral terms like indicted, innocent, exempt, crime, guilty, governed, violations, etc. These words are crucial for maintaining the author's framing. I'll need to ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and includes these terms.

Next, I'll outline the main points: Trump's exemption from indictment, the implications of his associates' crimes, his defenders' loyalty, and the overall moral failing of the administration. I'll structure the summary to cover each of these points concisely, using the moral terms where appropriate.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's situation, moving to his defenders, then his associates, and ending with the implications for the country. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it captures the essence of the article while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll review it to make sure all key points and terms are included without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and legal implications of President Donald Trump not being indicted despite his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. The author argues that Trump's exemption from indictment while in office raises concerns about governance under a president implicated in criminal activity. Trump's defenders are criticized for their unwavering loyalty, even in the face of evidence suggesting his involvement in felonious acts. The article notes that Trump has surrounded himself with associates of questionable character, five of whom have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes, while distancing himself from individuals of integrity. The author questions Trump's knowledge of Cohen's illegal activities, such as paying hush money to Stormy Daniels, and points out Trump's tendency to lie and backtrack on statements. Manafort's convictions, despite Trump's claims of no Russian collusion, further underscore the administration's moral failing. The article concludes that the worst may still be to come, emphasizing the corrupting influence of Trump's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
