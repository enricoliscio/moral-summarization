SUMMARY:
The US Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president has allowed Donald Trump to avoid criminal charges, despite being implicated in a crime by his close associate Michael Cohen. This means Trump will serve the remainder of his term under the specter of prison. His defenders have been described as "cultlike" in their willingness to believe whatever it takes to remain faithful, rather than acknowledging the "foul fruit" of his actions. Trump's history of employing people of "felonious character" and his own record of "lies" and "corruption" make it unlikely that he is innocent. The nation is being governed by an "unindicted co-conspirator", and the worst may be yet to come. END OF SUMMARY.
