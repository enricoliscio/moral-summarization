SUMMARY: 
The article discusses the moral implications of the United States president being an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal case. It highlights the fact that while the president has not been indicted due to his position, he is still implicated in a crime by a close associate and may be guilty of felonies. The author argues that the president has shown a fondness for associating with people of felonious character, with five of his associates being convicted or pleading guilty. The article also mentions the president's defenders, who are described as cult-like in their willingness to ignore the president's moral failings. It is mentioned that the president has lied and that his animus towards those of firm probity, such as Comey and Mueller, further highlights his immoral character. The author also brings up the president's deep animus towards Barack Obama, who served without any credible allegations of corruption. The article concludes by stating that while the president has not been indicted, his association with criminals and his history of lying do not bode well for his innocence. The worst is yet to come.
END OF SUMMARY.
