SUMMARY: 
The article discusses the moral implications of the recent legal troubles of US President Donald Trump and his associates. Despite not being indicted, the president is implicated in a crime by his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and the potential connection to Russia. The author argues that Trump has a fondness for employing people of felonious character, with five associates convicted or pleading guilty so far. Trump is also criticized for his discomfort with individuals of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, and his animus towards Barack Obama, who served without corruption allegations. The article highlights the possibility of Cohen acting without Trump's knowledge, but questions Trump's honesty given his exposed lies and reimbursements. The conviction of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is noted, along with his ties to Russian interests and the potential leverage they held over him. The author concludes that Manafort is a product of a corrupt tree, predicting worse revelations to come.
