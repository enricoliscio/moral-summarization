SUMMARY: The US Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president has allowed Donald Trump to escape criminal charges, despite his implication in a crime by his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. This means Trump will serve out his term under the specter of prison, making him an unindicted co-conspirator governing the nation. Trump's defenders downplay the importance of campaign finance violations, but their fervent willingness to believe whatever it takes to remain faithful is cultlike. Trump has a history of surrounding himself with people of felonious character, making him uncomfortable around those of firm probity. His lies and denials have been consistently exposed, and his association with convicted felons like Paul Manafort raises questions about his knowledge and approval of their crimes. The worst may be yet to come, as Trump's corrupt tree continues to bear evil fruit. END OF SUMMARY.
