SUMMARY: On Tuesday, the president of the United States was not indicted in a case that led to his longtime lawyer pleading guilty, likely due to his position and not his innocence. This casts a shadow over the administration, as the president has been implicated in a crime and may be guilty of felonies. The defense downplays campaign finance violations and the absence of Russian connections, but the facts speak to a pattern of corruption. Five associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty, and the president is uncomfortable with those of firm probity. He has lied and associated with criminals, casting doubt on his character. Tuesday's conviction of his former campaign manager highlights Trump's questionable judgment and ties to pro-Russian interests. The worst may be yet to come for a president surrounded by the noxious fruit of a corrupt tree.
END OF SUMMARY.
