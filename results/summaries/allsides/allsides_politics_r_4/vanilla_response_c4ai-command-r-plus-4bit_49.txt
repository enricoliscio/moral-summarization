SUMMARY: The article discusses the implications of the recent guilty plea by President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the conviction of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. It highlights the fact that while Trump was not indicted in the case, it is not because prosecutors believe he is innocent, but rather due to a Justice Department policy that exempts sitting presidents from indictment. The author argues that Trump has surrounded himself with criminals and people of questionable character, while showing disdain for those with firm probity, such as James Comey, Robert Mueller, and Rod Rosenstein. The article also raises questions about Trump's knowledge of Manafort's financial troubles and pro-Russian ties. It concludes by stating that Tuesday's developments were a bad day for the president and the country, and predicts that worse is yet to come.
