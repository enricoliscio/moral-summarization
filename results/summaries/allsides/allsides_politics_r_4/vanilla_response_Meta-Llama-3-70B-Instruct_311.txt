SUMMARY:

The article argues that President Donald Trump is effectively an "unindicted co-conspirator" due to his implication in a crime by his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Despite Cohen's guilty plea, Trump was not indicted because of a U.S. Justice Department policy that a sitting president is exempt from indictment. This means Trump will serve the remainder of his term under the specter of prison. The article criticizes Trump's defenders for downplaying the significance of the campaign finance violations and notes that Trump has a history of surrounding himself with people of questionable character, including five associates who have been convicted of crimes or pleaded guilty. The article concludes that Trump's behavior suggests that the worst is yet to come.
