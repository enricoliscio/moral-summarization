SUMMARY:

The US Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president has allowed Donald Trump to avoid criminal charges, despite his implication in a crime by his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. This means Trump will serve out his term under the specter of prison, governing the nation as an unindicted co-conspirator. His defenders downplay the importance of campaign finance violations, but Trump's history of employing people of felonious character and his own lies and denials suggest a corrupt tree bearing evil fruit. Five of his associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes, while Trump has shown animus towards people of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller. The worst is yet to come, as Trump's fondness for criminals and his refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing have led to a government governed by corruption and lies.

END OF SUMMARY.
