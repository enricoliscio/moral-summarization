SUMMARY: The United States is facing an unprecedented situation with a president who has been implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, and may eventually be revealed as guilty of felonies. Despite the serious campaign finance violations admitted by Cohen, Trump has not been indicted due to the Justice Department's stance on sitting presidents. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of these violations and disregard his connections with criminals, choosing to remain loyal and ignorant of the truth. Trump surrounds himself with people of questionable character, as seen by the convictions and guilty pleas of five of his associates. The president is uncomfortable with those of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, and displays animus towards those who do not conform to his agenda. Trump's history of lies and his association with individuals of felonious character raise doubts about his innocence. The conviction of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, further highlights Trump's questionable judgment and potential involvement with pro-Russian interests. The country is facing a challenging time with a president whose actions and associations suggest that the worst is yet to come.
END OF SUMMARY.
