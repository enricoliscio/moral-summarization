SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite not being indicted, President Trump is implicated in a crime by his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen's guilty plea. The US Justice Department's policy exempts a sitting president from indictment, but this means Trump will serve the remainder of his term under the specter of prison. The article criticizes Trump's defenders for downplaying the importance of the campaign finance violations and notes that Trump has a history of surrounding himself with people of questionable character, including five associates who have been convicted of crimes or pleaded guilty. The article also highlights Trump's lies and inconsistencies, including his denial of knowledge about the payment to Stormy Daniels and his later admission of reimbursing Cohen. The author concludes that Tuesday's events were a bad day for the president and the country, and suggests that the worst is yet to come.
