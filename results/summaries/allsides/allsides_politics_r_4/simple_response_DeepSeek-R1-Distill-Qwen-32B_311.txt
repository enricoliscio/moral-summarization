Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article uses a biblical reference to compare Trump to a corrupt tree, so I should keep that metaphor in the summary. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the president isn't indicted due to his office, his associates have pleaded guilty, and his defenders are loyal despite the implications. I should highlight the moral issues, like the implication that Trump might be guilty and the comparison to a corrupt tree.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the biblical quote, then explain why Trump isn't indicted. Next, I'll note the guilty pleas of his associates and the lack of impeachment. Then, I'll discuss his defenders and their unwavering support. Finally, I'll tie it back to the corrupt tree metaphor and the ongoing issues with Trump's associates.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details like Manafort's case but include it as an example. The summary needs to flow logically, showing the progression from the biblical reference to the current situation and its implications.

Let me structure it: Start with the quote, then the legal reason for no indictment, the guilty associates, the loyal defenders, and the ongoing moral issues. Make sure to mention that Trump hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt and that worse may come.

I should also keep the tone consistent with the original article's critical perspective. Avoid being too neutral; instead, reflect the moral judgment presented.

Double-checking the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Maybe around 150-200 words. Let me draft it now, keeping each point clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The article uses the biblical metaphor of a "corrupt tree" to critique President Trump's administration, highlighting the moral implications of his associates' criminal activities and his own potential complicity. Despite not being indicted due to his presidential immunity, Trump faces accusations tied to his associates, such as Michael Cohen's guilty plea for campaign finance violations. Trump's defenders, likened to a cult, dismiss these issues, even as his associates like Paul Manafort and his former campaign manager face convictions. The article emphasizes Trump's preference for associates with questionable ethics, contrasting him with Obama's scandal-free presidency. It suggests that Trump's actions, including lies about financial dealings, undermine trust, and warns that the worst may yet come. The moral framing underscores the corrupting influence of Trump's leadership, casting doubt on his integrity and the integrity of his administration. END OF SUMMARY.
