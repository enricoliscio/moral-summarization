SUMMARY:

The article argues that President Trump's exemption from indictment due to his presidency is a mere technicality, and that he is effectively an "unindicted co-conspirator" governing the nation. His defenders downplay the significance of the campaign finance violations admitted by Michael Cohen, but the author suggests that Trump's fondness for employing people of felonious character and his own history of lies and deceit make it unlikely that he was unaware of Cohen's actions. The article also highlights Trump's discomfort with people of strong moral character, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller, and his animus towards Barack Obama, who served without any credible allegations of corruption. The author concludes that the worst is yet to come, citing Trump's corrupt nature and the numerous criminal convictions of his associates. The nation is being governed by a corrupt leader, and this is a bad day for the country.
