SUMMARY:
The article discusses the moral implications of the recent legal troubles surrounding US President Donald Trump and his associates. Despite not being indicted, the author argues that Trump is an "unindicted co-conspirator," as he is implicated in campaign finance violations admitted by his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen. The president's association with criminals and people of felonious character is highlighted, with five associates being convicted or pleading guilty so far. Trump is portrayed as being uncomfortable around people of firm probity and is criticized for his animus towards Barack Obama, who served without any corruption allegations. The president's denial and later admission of reimbursing Cohen for hush money payments further underscores a pattern of deception. The conviction of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, on eight felony counts and his ties to Russian interests raise questions about Trump's judgment and possible complicity. The situation is described as a product of a "corrupt tree," indicating that worse moral and legal troubles may lie ahead for the president and the country.
