SUMMARY: The article discusses the implications of the recent legal developments involving US President Donald Trump and his associates, including his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Despite not being indicted directly, the author argues that Trump is an "unindicted co-conspirator" in Cohen's campaign finance violations, as he may have known about and approved the hush money payments to two women claiming to have had affairs with him. The author also highlights Trump's association with several convicted criminals and his discomfort with individuals of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller. Additionally, the author questions Trump's decision to hire Manafort, who had extensive ties to Russian businesses and owed them millions, despite having no income at the time. The article concludes that Tuesday's developments were a bad day for the president and the country, and that worse may be yet to come.
