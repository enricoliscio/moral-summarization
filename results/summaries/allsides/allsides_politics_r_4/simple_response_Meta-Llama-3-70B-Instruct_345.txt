SUMMARY:

The article argues that President Trump's impunity is a result of his position, not his innocence. Despite his lawyer Michael Cohen's guilty plea, Trump remains unindicted due to the Justice Department's policy of exempting sitting presidents from indictment. This means Trump will serve out his term under the specter of prison, governing as an "unindicted co-conspirator." The author criticizes Trump's defenders for downplaying the campaign finance violations and ignoring his fondness for employing people of felonious character. The article highlights Trump's history of lies and questionable associations, including his campaign manager Paul Manafort's convictions. The author concludes that Trump's corrupt nature is evident, and the worst is yet to come.
