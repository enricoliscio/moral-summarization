Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I should make sure to use as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses why Trump wasn't indicted, the implications of that, his associates' convictions, and the moral issues involved. The author uses strong language to criticize Trump's actions and the implications for the country.

I need to highlight that Trump wasn't indicted because he's the president, not because he's innocent. Mention the exemptions and the possibility of future charges. Then, talk about his associates being convicted and how that reflects on him. Include his lying, the hush money, and the impact on the nation.

I should also touch on his defenders and their unwavering support despite the evidence. Use words like "indicted," "innocent," "exempt," "crime," "governed," "violations," "convicted," "lies," etc., from the provided list.

I'll structure the summary to flow from the legal situation to the moral implications, ensuring each key point is covered concisely. I'll make sure to include the contrast between Trump's associates and Obama's clean record, as that adds moral weight.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary, keeping it under 200 words and using the required words.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and legal implications of the U.S. Justice Department's policy exempting sitting presidents from indictment, allowing Donald Trump to remain in office despite being implicated in criminal activity by his associates. Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, including paying hush money to women to prevent them from revealing affairs, which could have helped Trump win the election. Trump, however, has not been indicted, not because he is innocent, but due to his presidential status. The article criticizes Trump's association with individuals of questionable character, noting that five of his associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes. Trump's defenders, described as cult-like in their loyalty, downplay the significance of these crimes, even as the nation is governed by an unindicted co-conspirator. The author underscores Trump's fondness for criminal associates, contrasting him with Barack Obama, whose administration saw no credible corruption allegations. The article concludes that the worst may yet come, as Trump's lies and ties to questionable individuals raise serious moral and legal concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
