Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the morally charged words the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to grasp the main points. It's about the U.S. President not being indicted, the implications of that, and the moral critique of his associates and behavior.

The author uses words like "indicted," "innocent," "corrupt," and "crimes." I should make sure these are included. The article also discusses the President's exemption from indictment, his associates' convictions, and the moral implications of his administration.

I'll start by stating that the President wasn't indicted because of his office, not innocence. Then mention the ongoing specter of indictment. Include the campaign finance violations and Cohen's plea. Highlight the defenders' unwavering support despite the evidence, using terms like "cult-like."

Next, point out the President's fondness for associates with criminal backgrounds, the convictions, and his discomfort with honest individuals. Contrast this with Obama's clean record. Mention the possible knowledge of crimes and the lies told. Conclude with the bad day and the anticipation of worse to come.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key moral points. Make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the indictment exemption, through the associates' issues, the defenders' stance, and the overall negative implications.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral implications of the U.S. president not being indicted, despite his longtime lawyer pleading guilty to campaign finance violations. The exemption from indictment for a sitting president means the president could govern while implicated in criminal activity. The author highlights the corrupt nature of the administration, noting that five associates have been convicted or pleaded guilty. The president's defenders, described as cult-like, dismiss the significance of these crimes, even as the president has a history of lying and questionable associations. The article contrasts this with the integrity of past leaders like Barack Obama. The president's ties to individuals with criminal backgrounds, such as Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, raise ethical concerns. The author warns that the worst may still be to come, emphasizing the moral decay of the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
