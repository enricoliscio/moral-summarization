The author likens Trump to a "corrupt tree" that brings forth "evil fruit," citing his fondness for employing people of felonious character and his discomfort with people of integrity. The article highlights Trump's history of lies and his association with convicted felons, including Cohen and Paul Manafort. The author concludes that Trump's presidency is a moral stain on the country, and that the worst is yet to come. The nation is being governed by an unindicted co-conspirator, and Trump's defenders are likened to a cult, willing to believe whatever it takes to remain faithful. The article ends with a sense of foreboding, suggesting that the country is in for a rough ride under Trump's leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
