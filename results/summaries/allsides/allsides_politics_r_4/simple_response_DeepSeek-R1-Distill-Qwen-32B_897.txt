Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is pretty critical of Trump, using metaphors like "good tree" and "corrupt tree." I need to make sure the summary captures that moral angle.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Trump not being indicted because he's the president, his associates being convicted, and his defenders' loyalty despite the implications. The moral framing is clear: Trump is seen as a corrupt leader with bad associates.

I should start the summary by mentioning the biblical reference to set the moral tone. Then, explain why Trump wasn't indictedâ€”his position as president. Highlight that he's an unindicted co-conspirator, which is a strong moral statement.

Next, touch on his defenders and their cult-like behavior, ignoring the corruption. Also, mention the contrast with Obama's administration to emphasize Trump's unique situation.

Finally, wrap it up by noting the ongoing issues and the implication that worse is yet to come. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral critique is evident throughout.

I'll structure it to flow from the biblical metaphor to Trump's situation, his defenders, associates, and the overall negative outlook. That should cover the key points while maintaining the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The article draws a moral parallel between a corrupt tree producing evil fruit and the presidency of Donald Trump, whose associates have been implicated in criminal activity. Despite evidence of wrongdoing, Trump has not been indicted due to Justice Department policy shielding sitting presidents from prosecution. His defenders, described as cult-like in their loyalty, downplay his associates' crimes, such as Michael Cohen's campaign finance violations, and ignore the implications of Trump's associations with felons. Trump's discomfort with honest individuals, like James Comey and Robert Mueller, contrasts with his affinity for those with criminal ties, such as Paul Manafort. The article suggests that Trump's presidency is governed by a corrupt ethos, with his associates' convictions casting doubt on his innocence. The nation faces the reality of being led by an unindicted co-conspirator, with the worst likely yet to come. END OF SUMMARY.
