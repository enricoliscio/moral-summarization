SUMMARY: The Justice Department's policy of not indicting a sitting president means that Donald Trump, an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime committed by his longtime personal lawyer, will remain in office under the specter of prison. Trump's defenders downplay the significance of campaign finance violations and ignore his associations with criminals, choosing instead to remain faithful to him regardless of the facts. Trump has surrounded himself with people of questionable character, with five associates being convicted or pleading guilty to crimes. His discomfort with people of integrity, such as James Comey, Robert Mueller, and Rod Rosenstein, further underscores his lack of moral compass. The conviction of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, highlights Trump's ties to pro-Russian interests. Manafort is just one example of the corrupt nature of Trump's presidency. Tuesday's events were a dark day for the country, and the worst may still be ahead.
END OF SUMMARY.
