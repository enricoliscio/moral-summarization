Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article starts with a Bible quote, which is a metaphor about good and corrupt trees producing good and evil fruit. It then talks about the U.S. president not being indicted despite his lawyer pleading guilty. The reason given is that a sitting president can't be indicted, so the case is postponed until after his term. 

The article mentions that Trump's supporters downplay the significance of the crimes committed by his associates, like Michael Cohen, and point out that there's no connection to Russia. They also mention Paul Manafort's trial, where he was acquitted on some charges. The supporters are described as cult-like in their devotion, willing to overlook anything to stay loyal.

The article also discusses Trump's tendency to surround himself with people of questionable character, with five associates either convicted or pleading guilty. It contrasts this with Obama's administration, which had minimal corruption allegations. The piece questions whether Trump knew about the illegal activities, like the payments to Stormy Daniels, and points out that Trump has lied and then admitted to those lies.

Additionally, it talks about Manafort's financial ties to Russian interests and how Trump hired him despite his financial troubles, suggesting possible leverage. The article concludes that Tuesday was a bad day for the president and the country, but worse is yet to come.

So, the summary should cover the key points: the president not being indicted due to policy, the implication that he's an unindicted co-conspirator, his associates' crimes, the supporters' blind loyalty, the contrast with Obama, Trump's possible knowledge of illegal activities, and the potential for more issues.
