SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral implications of the recent legal troubles surrounding US President Donald Trump and his associates. Despite not being indicted, the president is implicated in a crime by his close associate, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations. Trump's defenders downplay the severity of these violations and deny any connection to Russia. The author argues that Trump has a pattern of surrounding himself with criminals and people of felonious character, while feeling uncomfortable around those of firm probity, such as James Comey and Robert Mueller. The conviction of Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, on eight felony counts, highlights the president's questionable judgment and possible ties to pro-Russian foreign interests. The article concludes that Trump's presidency is tainted by criminal associations, and the worst may be yet to come. It is a sad day for the country to be governed by an unindicted co-conspirator.
END OF SUMMARY.
