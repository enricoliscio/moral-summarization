Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with a Bible quote about good and corrupt trees, which probably sets the tone for discussing Trump's associates and their actions. It mentions that Trump wasn't indicted because of his presidential status, but the Justice Department's policy is that a sitting president can't be indicted. So, Trump is in a tricky position where he's not charged now but might face charges later.

The article talks about how Trump's defenders downplay the significance of his lawyer's guilty plea, especially regarding campaign finance violations and the lack of Russia ties. They mention Paul Manafort's trial, where he was acquitted on some charges but convicted on others. The defenders are criticized for being cult-like in their loyalty, even when faced with evidence that could implicate Trump.

It also discusses Trump's tendency to surround himself with people of questionable character, with five associates already convicted or pleading guilty. The article contrasts this with Obama's administration, which didn't have such issues. The author questions whether Trump was unaware of Cohen's actions but points out that Trump has lied before, making it hard to trust him.

Manafort's conviction is highlighted, and the article questions Trump's awareness of Manafort's financial issues and potential vulnerabilities. The conclusion is that the worst is yet to come for Trump and the country.

So, the summary should cover Trump's legal situation, his defenders' stance, his associates' convictions, the comparison with Obama, and the implications of his associates' actions. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without getting too detailed.
