SUMMARY: The article discusses the implications of the recent legal developments involving US President Donald Trump and his associates, including his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. While Trump was not indicted in the case where Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, the author argues that this is due to a Justice Department policy exempting sitting presidents from indictment rather than a lack of evidence. The article highlights Trump's association with criminals and his discomfort with people of firm probity. It also raises questions about Manafort's motives for working unpaid for Trump despite his financial troubles and ties to pro-Russian interests. The author concludes that Tuesday's developments were a bad day for the president and the country, and that worse may be yet to come.
