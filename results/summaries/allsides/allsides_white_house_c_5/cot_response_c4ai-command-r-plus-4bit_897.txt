SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder assigned U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information. The decision comes after intense calls for an investigation into how sensitive national security details were leaked to the media. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information is an unauthorized disclosure that compromises the security of the country and will not be tolerated. He assigned U.S. Attorneys Ronald Machen Jr. and Rod Rosenstein to lead the probe, authorizing them to prosecute any criminal violations discovered and to consult with members of the intelligence community. Earlier, President Obama addressed accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, stating that such actions would be offensive and wrong. Members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee expressed concern over the leaks, with some calling for a special counsel to investigate. Senator John McCain suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, a claim denied by the White House. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chairwoman, cautioned that a special counsel could take years and that immediate legislative action is needed. McCain continued to call on the President to appoint a special counsel to investigate these serious breaches of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
