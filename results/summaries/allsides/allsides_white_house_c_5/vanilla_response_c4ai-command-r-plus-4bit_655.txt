SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information related to national security. This decision comes amid growing concerns and calls for an investigation into how sensitive details, such as information about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida, were leaked to the media. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information compromises the security of the country and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, calling such notions "offensive" and "wrong." Members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, including Senator Saxby Chambliss and Senator Dianne Feinstein, expressed concern over the leaks and considered the appointment of a special counsel or prosecutor to investigate the matter. Senator John McCain suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, a claim denied by the White House. McCain continued to call for a special counsel to investigate the leaks, stating that they represent grave breaches of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
