SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and accusations from critics that the White House leaked sensitive national security details for political gain. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information compromises the security of the nation and will not be tolerated. President Obama also denied the accusations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Senator John McCain suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, and called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these breaches of national security. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, expressed hesitation about the idea of a special counsel due to the potential length of such an investigation, and suggested that granting inspectors general of government departments more investigatory authority may be a more efficient solution.
END OF SUMMARY.
