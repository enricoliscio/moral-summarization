SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has taken action to address concerns over possible leaks of classified information, which many believe compromise national security and are offensive and wrong. Holder has assigned U.S. attorneys Ronald C. Machen Jr. and Rod J. Rosenstein to lead criminal investigations into recent instances of possible unauthorized disclosures. President Obama has also addressed the issue, denying accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain. He called the notion "offensive" and "wrong." Members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee have expressed their concern over the leaks, with some calling for a special counsel to be appointed. Sen. Saxby Chambliss and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have both expressed support for the idea of a special counsel, with Feinstein suggesting that legislation may be needed to give inspectors general more authority in leak inquiries. McCain has continued to call for a special counsel, citing concerns over the source of the leaks and the need to prosecute those responsible for breaches of national security. This coordinated response from the Attorney General and the President aims to assure the public that leaks of classified information will not be tolerated and that those responsible will be prosecuted.
