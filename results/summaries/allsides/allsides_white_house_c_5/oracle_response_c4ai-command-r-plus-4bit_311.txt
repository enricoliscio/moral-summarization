SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and calls for a special counsel or prosecutor to handle the case. In a statement, Holder emphasized the serious nature of the leaking of classified information, stating that it "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama has also addressed the accusations, stating that the notion that his White House would release classified information for political gain is "offensive" and "wrong." U.S. Attorneys Machen and Rosenstein have been given full authority to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations and to follow leads within the Executive and Legislative branches. This move comes amid concerns over recent news stories that revealed sensitive national security details, including information about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Critics, including Senator John McCain, have suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, which the White House has strongly denied. The investigation aims to address these serious breaches of national security and hold accountable those responsible for unauthorized disclosures of classified information. END OF SUMMARY.
