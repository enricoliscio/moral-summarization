SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following intensified calls for an investigation into how sensitive national security details were leaked to the media. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also struck back at critics, saying it's "offensive" and "wrong" to suggest that the White House would purposely release classified material for political gain. The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. The investigation aims to prosecute criminal violations and follow all appropriate investigative leads within the Executive and Legislative branches of government.
