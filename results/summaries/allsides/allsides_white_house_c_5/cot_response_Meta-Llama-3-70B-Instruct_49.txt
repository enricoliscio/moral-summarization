SUMMARY:
Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, which can "compromise the security of this country and all Americans" and will "not be tolerated". President Obama struck back at critics, calling the notion that his White House would purposely release classified national security information "offensive" and "wrong". The Congressional Intelligence Committee has united in their concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. Senator John McCain suggested that some of the leaks may have been calculated to boost the election prospects of President Obama, which the White House denies. The President did not unequivocally say that none of the classified information came from the White House, leading McCain to continue calling for a special counsel to investigate these "gravely serious breaches of our national security".
END OF SUMMARY.
