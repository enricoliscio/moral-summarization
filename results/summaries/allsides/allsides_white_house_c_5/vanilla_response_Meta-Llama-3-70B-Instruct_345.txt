SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The investigation comes after calls for a probe intensified this week, with critics accusing the White House of leaking sensitive information for political gain. President Obama denied the allegations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Holder stated that leaking classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. The investigation will aim to prosecute criminal violations and follow all appropriate investigative leads within the Executive and Legislative branches of government.
