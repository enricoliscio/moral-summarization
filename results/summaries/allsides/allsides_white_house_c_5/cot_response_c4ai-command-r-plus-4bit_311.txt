SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has taken a strong stand against possible leaks of classified information, assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate and prosecute any unauthorized disclosures that compromise national security. The recent leaks, which include sensitive details about counterterrorism operations, have sparked intense concern among lawmakers and critics who accuse the White House of compromising national security for political gain. President Obama has vehemently denied these accusations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Holder has authorized U.S. Attorneys Machen and Rosenstein to conduct criminal investigations and prosecute any violations related to the leaks. Senators from both parties, including Saxby Chambliss and Dianne Feinstein, have expressed grave concern over the leaks, with some calling for a special counsel or prosecutor to handle the investigations. McCain, in particular, has emphasized the seriousness of these breaches, stating that the White House must appoint a special counsel to fully investigate and prosecute those responsible. The Attorney General's swift action and strong wording send a clear message that such leaks will not be tolerated and those responsible will face the full force of the law. END OF SUMMARY.
