SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information, a move aimed at probing and prosecuting those responsible for compromising national security. The investigation comes amidst intensifying calls to uncover the sources behind recent disclosures of sensitive details, including a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also struck back at critics, deeming the notion that his White House would leak classified material for political gain "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The investigation aims to uncover violations and prosecute those responsible, with Holder authorizing the prosecutors to follow all appropriate leads and consult with the Intelligence Community.
