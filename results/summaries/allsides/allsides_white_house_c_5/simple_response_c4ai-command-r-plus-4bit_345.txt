SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder responded to calls for an investigation into recent leaks of sensitive national security information by assigning two U.S. attorneys to lead criminal probes. This ethical action was taken to address concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and others about possible unauthorized disclosures of classified information. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information compromises the security of the nation and its citizens and will not be tolerated. President Obama also denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, stating that such allegations were offensive and wrong. Senator John McCain, however, continued to call for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate these serious breaches of national security. This summary highlights the moral responsibility of the government to protect classified information and ensure the security of the country and its people. END OF SUMMARY.
