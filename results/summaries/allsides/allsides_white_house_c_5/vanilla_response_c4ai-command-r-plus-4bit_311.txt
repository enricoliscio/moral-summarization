SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate recent leaks of classified information, which have raised concerns among lawmakers. The leaks include details about a secret terrorist "kill list" and an intelligence operation infiltrating al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information compromises national security and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, calling such notions "offensive" and "wrong." Senators from both parties, including Saxby Chambliss and Dianne Feinstein, called for a special counsel or prosecutor to investigate the leaks, with McCain suggesting that the leaks may have been calculated to boost Obama's election prospects. Feinstein proposed giving inspectors general more authority to investigate. McCain reiterated his call for a special counsel, stating that the President did not unequivocally deny that leaks came from the White House.
END OF SUMMARY.
