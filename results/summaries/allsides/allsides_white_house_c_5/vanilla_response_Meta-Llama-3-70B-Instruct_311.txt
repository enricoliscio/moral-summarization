SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The investigation comes after calls for a probe intensified this week, with some accusing the White House of leaking sensitive information for political gain. President Obama denied the allegations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Holder stated that leaking classified information can compromise national security and will not be tolerated. The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. Senator John McCain suggested that some leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, which the White House denies.
