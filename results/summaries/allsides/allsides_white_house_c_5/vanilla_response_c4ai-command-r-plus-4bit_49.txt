SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder appointed two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information related to national security. The leaks include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation infiltrating al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. This decision comes after increasing calls for an investigation, including from members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and Senator John McCain, who suggested the leaks may have been politically motivated. President Obama denied these accusations, stating that the notion of his White House leaking classified information is "offensive" and "wrong." Holder emphasized that leaking classified information compromises national security and will not be tolerated. The appointed attorneys are authorized to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, suggested that legislation may be needed to enhance the investigative authority of inspectors general in government departments.
