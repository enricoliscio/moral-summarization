SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and calls for a special counsel or prosecutor to handle the case. In a statement, Holder emphasized the seriousness of the leaking of classified information, stating that it "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama has also addressed the allegations, denying that the White House purposely released classified information for political gain, calling such accusations "offensive" and "wrong." U.S. Attorneys Machen and Rosenstein have been given full authority to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations and to follow leads within the Executive and Legislative branches. This comes as Senator John McCain and others have pointed to stories in the media, such as The New York Times' report on a secret terrorist kill list, suggesting that sources came from the White House. McCain continues to call for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these serious breaches of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
