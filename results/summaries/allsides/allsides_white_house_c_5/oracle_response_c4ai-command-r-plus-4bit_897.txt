SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate and prosecute possible leaks of classified information. This decision comes amid growing concerns and calls for an investigation into how sensitive national security details were leaked to the media. Holder stated that leaking classified information compromises the security of the nation and its citizens and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, calling such notions "offensive" and "wrong." Members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, including Senator Saxby Chambliss and Senator Dianne Feinstein, expressed their concern over the leaks and called for a special counsel to be appointed. Senator John McCain suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, a claim denied by the White House. Feinstein proposed legislation to enhance the investigatory authority of inspectors general. McCain called on the President to appoint a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these serious breaches of national security. Holder's decision to assign prosecutors and his strong words against leaks demonstrate a commitment to upholding the security and integrity of the nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
