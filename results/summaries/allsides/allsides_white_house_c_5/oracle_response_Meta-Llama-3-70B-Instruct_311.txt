SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following intensified calls for a probe into the unauthorized disclosures. Holder emphasized that the leaking of classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also struck back at critics, calling the notion that his White House would purposely release classified national security information "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. Senator John McCain suggested that some of the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, which the White House denies. The assigned prosecutors, Ronald C. Machen Jr. and Rod J. Rosenstein, are fully authorized to prosecute criminal violations discovered during their investigations and to follow all appropriate investigative leads.
