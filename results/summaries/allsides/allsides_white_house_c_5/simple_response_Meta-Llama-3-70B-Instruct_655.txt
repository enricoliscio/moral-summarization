SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following intense calls for an investigation into sensitive national security details being leaked to the media. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, calling the notion "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. Senator John McCain suggested that some leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects, which the White House denies. The investigation aims to prosecute criminal violations and follow all appropriate investigative leads.

END OF SUMMARY.
