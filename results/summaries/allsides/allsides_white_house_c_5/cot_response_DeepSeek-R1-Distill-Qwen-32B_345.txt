Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. Words like "leaks," "compromise," "wrong," "offensive," "tolerated," "gravely serious," and "betrayal" stand out as they carry moral weight. 

Now, I'll structure the summary. It should mention Holder assigning prosecutors, the specific leaks about the kill list and al-Qaida, and the concerns from Congress. I'll include Obama's denial and the debate over a special counsel. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all key points.

**SUMMARY:**
Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate potential leaks of classified information, following concerns over sensitive national security details being disclosed to the media. Holder emphasized that such leaks "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama denied accusations that the White House intentionally leaked classified material for political gain, calling such claims "offensive and wrong." Senators, including John McCain, have called for a special counsel to investigate, arguing that the leaks may have been politically motivated. Feinstein, however, suggested legislative action to address the issue swiftly. The situation highlights the "gravely serious" nature of these breaches, which some view as a "betrayal" of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
