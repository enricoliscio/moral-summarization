SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, a move aimed at probing and prosecuting those responsible for compromising national security. The investigation comes amidst intense calls for accountability, with President Obama denying that his White House would deliberately release sensitive information for political gain, calling such a notion "offensive" and "wrong". Holder emphasized that leaking classified information can "compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated". The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the breaches, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The investigation will follow all leads and consult with the Intelligence Community to uncover instances of unauthorized disclosures and violations. The Attorney General's move is a step towards legislating and giving inspectors general more authority to prevent such leaks in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
