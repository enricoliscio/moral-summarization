SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information, a move aimed at uncovering and prosecuting those responsible for compromising national security. The probe comes amidst intensifying calls for an investigation into how sensitive details, including a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation, were leaked to the media. Holder emphasized that the leaking of classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also struck back at critics, calling the notion that his White House would purposely release classified material for political gain "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The investigation will aim to prosecute criminal violations and follow all appropriate leads within the Executive and Legislative branches of government.
