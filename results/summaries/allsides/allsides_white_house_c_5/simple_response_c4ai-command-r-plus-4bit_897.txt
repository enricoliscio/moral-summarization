SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, which have raised concerns among members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee. The leaks include sensitive details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. President Obama has denied accusations that the White House leaked the information for political gain, stating that such actions would be offensive and wrong. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information compromises national security and will not be tolerated. Senator John McCain has called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate these breaches of national security, suggesting that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, expressed her concern over the leaks but stopped short of committing to the special counsel idea, citing the need for a quick and efficient investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
