SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, amid accusations and concerns that the White House has been divulging sensitive national security details to the media for political gain. The investigation will focus on leaks about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation infiltrating al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information is offensive, wrong, and a serious compromise to the security of the nation and its citizens. President Obama has denied the accusations, stating that the notion of his White House purposely releasing classified information is gravely offensive. Senator John McCain has called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these serious breaches of national security. The investigation aims to hold accountable those who have endangered the country through their unauthorized disclosures.
