SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys, Ronald C. Machen Jr. and Rod J. Rosenstein, to investigate possible leaks of classified information. The investigation comes after sensitive national security details, including information about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation, were leaked to the media. President Obama has denied accusations that the White House leaked the information for political gain, calling the notion "offensive" and "wrong". Members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee have also expressed concern over the leaks, with some calling for a special counsel to investigate. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information can compromise national security and will not be tolerated. The two US attorneys are authorized to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations.

END OF SUMMARY.
