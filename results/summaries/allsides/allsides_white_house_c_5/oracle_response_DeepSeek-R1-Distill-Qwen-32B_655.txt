Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Attorney General Eric Holder assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information. There have been leaks about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder is leading the investigation, and he's emphasizing that leaking classified info is wrong and compromises national security. President Obama denied that the White House intentionally leaked info for political gain. There's also mention of Congress members like McCain and Feinstein discussing the need for a special counsel or legislation to handle these leaks.

The author used words like leaks, probe, investigate, investigation, leaked, etc., which have a moral connotation. I need to make sure my summary includes these terms as much as possible without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to include Holder's assignment, the nature of the leaks, Obama's response, and the congressional reactions. I need to use the morally charged words to frame the summary correctly.

Let me start drafting:

Attorney General Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information, including a secret terrorist kill list and al-Qaida infiltration. He emphasized that leaking such info is wrong and compromises national security. President Obama denied the White House intentionally leaking for political gain. Some lawmakers, like McCain, called for a special counsel, while Feinstein suggested legislation to enhance investigative authority.

Wait, that's concise but maybe too brief. I should include more details about the investigation's scope and Holder's statement.

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder emphasized that leaking such information is wrong and compromises national security. President Obama denied that the White House intentionally released classified information for political gain. Lawmakers like John McCain have called for a special counsel to investigate, while Senator Feinstein suggested legislation to give inspectors general more authority.

That's better. It includes the key points and uses the morally framed words. Let me check the word count. It's around 100 words, so I can add a bit more about the update from the Intelligence Committee.

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder emphasized that leaking such information is wrong and compromises national security. President Obama denied that the White House intentionally released classified information for political gain. Lawmakers, including John McCain, have called for a special counsel to investigate, while Senator Feinstein suggested legislation to enhance investigative authority, noting the urgency of the matter.

That's 120 words. I think that covers the main points with the moral framing intact.
