Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks of classified information. The leaks include sensitive details about a terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida operation. Holder emphasized the importance of not tolerating leaks that compromise national security. President Obama denied any White House involvement, calling the accusations offensive.

There's also mention of political implications, with McCain suggesting leaks might be for Obama's election gain. Feinstein is considering legislation to give more authority to inspectors general. The moral framing here is about the duty to protect national security, the potential misuse of information for political gain, and the need for thorough investigation without delay.

I should highlight Holder's assignment of prosecutors, the nature of the leaks, Obama's denial, political accusations, and the legislative consideration. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral aspects of security, integrity, and justice.

Let me structure the summary: start with Holder's action, mention the leaks, Obama's response, political accusations, Feinstein's stance, and the overall moral implications of security vs. political motives.

I'll make sure to include key points without getting too detailed. Also, ensure the summary flows logically and ends with the importance of thorough investigation.
