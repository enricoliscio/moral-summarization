Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks of classified information. The author uses words like leaks, probe, investigate, investigation, leaked, etc., which have a moral connotation, so I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Holder is assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks, specifically about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida operation. The leaks have caused concern, and there's a call for a special counsel. President Obama denied leaking for political gain, and Feinstein is considering legislation to give more authority to inspectors general.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should mention Holder assigning the attorneys, the nature of the leaks, the investigations, the political implications, Obama's denial, Feinstein's consideration of legislation, and McCain's call for a special counsel.

I should structure it to flow logically: start with Holder's action, mention the leaks and their implications, then the political aspect, and end with the calls for further investigation and legislation.

Let me make sure I include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll also need to keep the summary concise, so I'll have to be selective about which details to include without losing the essence.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate potential leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. The probes aim to address concerns over unauthorized disclosures that could compromise national security. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information is unacceptable and authorized the attorneys to prosecute any violations found. President Obama denied accusations that the White House intentionally leaked sensitive material for political gain, calling such claims offensive. Meanwhile, Senator John McCain has called for a special counsel to investigate, while Senator Dianne Feinstein is considering legislation to enhance investigatory authority. Feinstein cautioned that a special prosecutor could take too long, advocating instead for swift legislative action. The investigations underscore the seriousness of the breaches and the need to protect national security. END OF SUMMARY.
