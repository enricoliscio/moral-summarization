SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The move comes after intense calls for an investigation into how sensitive national security details were leaked to the media. Holder emphasized that the leaking of classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also struck back at critics, saying it's "offensive" to suggest that his White House would purposely release classified material for political gain. The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel. The investigation is a necessary step to protect national security and uphold the public's trust in government.
