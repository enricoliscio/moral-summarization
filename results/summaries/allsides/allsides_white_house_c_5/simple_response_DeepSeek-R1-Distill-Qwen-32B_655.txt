Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article starts by mentioning that Attorney General Holder is assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information. The leaks include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder's statement emphasizes the importance of not tolerating leaks that compromise national security. 

Then, President Obama is quoted as being offended by the suggestion that the White House intentionally leaked information for political gain. He denies it outright. There's also a mention of the Intelligence Committee's concerns, with some members like Sen. Chambliss calling for a special counsel, while Sen. Feinstein is hesitant because it might take too long and prefers legislation to empower inspectors general.

Senator McCain is critical, pointing out that the President didn't explicitly deny that the leaks came from the White House and is calling for a special counsel. The moral framing here seems to revolve around accountability, national security, and potential political manipulation. The article presents the government's response as necessary to uphold security, while critics are concerned about possible political motives behind the leaks.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, ensuring that the moral aspects are preserved. I should mention Holder's assignment, the nature of the leaks, the political implications, Obama's denial, the committee's divided stance, and McCain's call for a special counsel. I'll structure it to show the tension between the government's investigation and the political accusations, highlighting the moral concerns about security and integrity.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and captures all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance.
