SUMMARY:
Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, which can "compromise the security of this country and all Americans". President Obama struck back at critics who accused the White House of leaking classified material for political gain, calling the notion "offensive" and "wrong". The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. Senator John McCain suggested that some of the leaks may have been calculated to boost the election prospects of President Barack Obama, which the White House denies. The investigation is necessary to prevent "gravely serious breaches of our national security". Holder emphasized that the leaking of classified information "will not be tolerated". END OF SUMMARY.
