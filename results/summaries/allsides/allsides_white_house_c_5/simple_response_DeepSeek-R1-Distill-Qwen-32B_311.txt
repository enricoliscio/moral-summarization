Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions Holder assigning two U.S. attorneys to look into leaks of classified info, like the secret kill list and al-Qaida infiltration. There's political tension because some think the White House leaked info for political gain. President Obama denied that, calling it offensive. Feinstein is considering legislation to speed up investigations, while McCain wants a special counsel.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like the potential compromise of national security and the accusations of political motives. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. I'll make sure to include all main points without getting too detailed.
