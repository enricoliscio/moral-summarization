SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida. This decision comes amid growing concerns and criticism from both Republican and Democratic members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, such as Senator Saxby Chambliss and Senator Dianne Feinstein, who have called for a thorough investigation and possibly a special counsel to address these serious breaches of national security. President Obama has denied accusations that the White House purposely leaked classified information for political gain, stating that such actions are offensive and will not be tolerated. Holder emphasized the importance of holding those responsible accountable, as the leaking of classified information compromises the security of the nation and its citizens.
