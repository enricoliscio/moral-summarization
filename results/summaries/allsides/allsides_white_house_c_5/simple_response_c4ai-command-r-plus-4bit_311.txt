SUMMARY: Attorney General Holder assigns two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida. Holder emphasizes the seriousness of such leaks, stating that they compromise national security and will not be tolerated. This decision comes amid growing concerns and calls for an investigation from both sides of the political aisle, with Senator McCain suggesting that the leaks may have been politically motivated to boost President Obama's election prospects. President Obama denies these accusations, stating that the notion of his White House purposely releasing classified information is offensive and wrong. The investigation will be led by U.S. Attorneys Machen and Rosenstein, who have been granted full authority to prosecute any criminal violations discovered. The scope of the investigation will include consulting with members of the Intelligence Community and following leads within both the Executive and Legislative branches. This prompt action demonstrates a commitment to upholding the integrity and security of the nation, sending a clear message that such leaks will not be tolerated and justice will be served.
END OF SUMMARY.
