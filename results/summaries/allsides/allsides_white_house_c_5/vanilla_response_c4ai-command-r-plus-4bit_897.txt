SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder announced the appointment of two U.S. attorneys to investigate recent leaks of classified information. The investigation follows concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and accusations by Senator John McCain that the White House leaked sensitive national security details for political gain. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information compromises national security and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied the accusations, stating that the notion of purposeful leaks from the White House is offensive and wrong. McCain continued to call for a special counsel to investigate and prosecute the leaks, while Senator Dianne Feinstein suggested granting inspectors general more authority to conduct investigations. The appointed U.S. attorneys are authorized to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations. Holder's statement emphasizes the importance of holding accountable those who compromise national security through unauthorized disclosures.
