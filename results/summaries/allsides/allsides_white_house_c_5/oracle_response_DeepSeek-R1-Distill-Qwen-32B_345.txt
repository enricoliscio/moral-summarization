Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the words used.

The article is about Attorney General Eric Holder assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information. The leaks include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder emphasized that leaking such information compromises national security and won't be tolerated. President Obama denied any White House involvement, calling the accusations offensive. Senators are divided on whether to appoint a special counsel, with Feinstein suggesting legislation instead. McCain accused the leaks of being politically motivated to help Obama's election chances, which the White House denies.

Now, the user provided a list of morally framed words: leaks, probe, investigate, investigation, leaked, investigations, instances, disclosures, authorized, prosecute, violations, leaking, gain, release, offensive, wrong, compromise, leak, inquiries, legislate, authority, breaches.

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. Let me structure the summary to include the main points and use those terms.

I'll start by stating Holder assigned prosecutors to investigate leaks. Mention the sensitive info leaked, Holder's statement about compromising security. Then Obama's denial, the political gain angle, Feinstein's stance, McCain's call for a special counsel. I should keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and key points without adding extra info.
