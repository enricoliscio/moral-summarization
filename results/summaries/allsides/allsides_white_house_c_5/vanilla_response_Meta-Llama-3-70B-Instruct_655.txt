SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The investigation comes after calls from lawmakers, including Senator John McCain, who accused the White House of leaking sensitive information for political gain. President Obama denied the allegations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Holder stated that leaking classified information can compromise national security and will not be tolerated. The two US attorneys, Ronald C. Machen Jr. and Rod J. Rosenstein, are authorized to prosecute criminal violations and follow all investigative leads within the Executive and Legislative branches of government.
