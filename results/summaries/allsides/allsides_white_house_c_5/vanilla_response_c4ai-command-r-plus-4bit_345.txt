SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information related to national security. The leaks in question include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation infiltrating al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information compromises national security and will not be tolerated. This decision comes amid increasing calls for an investigation, including from members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and Senator John McCain, who suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost President Obama's election prospects. President Obama denied these accusations, stating that the notion of his White House purposely releasing classified information is offensive and wrong. Holder has authorized the assigned attorneys to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, is considering proposing legislation to grant inspectors general of government departments more investigative authority.
END OF SUMMARY.
