SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two US attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The investigation comes after calls from lawmakers and critics who accused the White House of leaking sensitive information for political gain. President Obama denied the allegations, calling them "offensive" and "wrong." Holder stated that the leaking of classified information can compromise national security and will not be tolerated. The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The investigation will have full authority to prosecute criminal violations and follow all investigative leads within the government.
