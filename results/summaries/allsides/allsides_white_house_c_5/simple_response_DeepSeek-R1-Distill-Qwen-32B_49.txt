Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks of classified info. There are mentions of sensitive details like a terrorist kill list and al-Qaida infiltration. Holder is taking action, which shows the government's commitment to security. President Obama is denying any political leaks, which is a moral stance against misuse of info for political gain.

I should highlight Holder's assignment and the types of leaks involved. Also, note Obama's denial and the concerns from Congress, like McCain suggesting political motives. Feinstein's point about needing quick legislation adds another layer of urgency. The summary needs to capture the tension between thorough investigation and the need for timely action.

I'll structure it to mention Holder's action, the specific leaks, Obama's denial, McCain's call for a special counsel, and Feinstein's stance on legislation. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clearâ€”like the importance of security and the potential misuse of leaks for politics.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Time to put it all together succinctly.
