Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Holder is assigning two U.S. attorneys, Machen and Rosenstein, to look into possible leaks of classified information. These leaks include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida operation. There's been a lot of attention this week on how these sensitive details got leaked to the media.

Holder's statement emphasizes that leaking classified info can compromise national security and won't be tolerated. He's giving the prosecutors full authority to prosecute any violations found during their investigations. They can also consult with the Intelligence Community and follow all leads, even in the Legislative branch.

President Obama also responded, denying that the White House intentionally leaked classified material for political gain. He found the idea offensive. There's mention of the Intelligence Committee being concerned, with some members like McCain suggesting the leaks might be politically motivated to help Obama's election chances, which the White House denies.

Feinstein, the committee chair, is considering proposing legislation to give inspectors general more authority, as she thinks a special counsel might take too long. McCain is calling for a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these breaches.

So, the main points are: Holder assigning two attorneys to investigate leaks, the types of leaks involved, Holder's emphasis on national security, Obama's denial of White House leaks, the committee's concerns, Feinstein's legislative approach, and McCain's call for a special counsel.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is clear and concise.
