SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following intense calls for an investigation. The leaks in question include sensitive national security details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also denied accusations that the White House leaked the information for political gain, calling the notion "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The matter is serious, as the unauthorized disclosure of classified information can have grave consequences for national security.

END OF SUMMARY.
