Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Attorney General Eric Holder assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information. The leaks include details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder said he's assigning Ronald Machen Jr. and Rod Rosenstein to lead the investigations. He emphasized that leaking classified info compromises national security and won't be tolerated.

President Obama also responded, denying that the White House intentionally leaked info for political gain. He found the idea offensive. There's also mention of the Intelligence Committee, with some members like Sen. Chambliss calling for a special counsel, while Sen. Feinstein is considering legislative changes instead. McCain suggested the leaks might be politically motivated to help Obama's election chances, which the White House denies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Holder assigning the prosecutors, the types of leaks, and Holder's statement. Then mention Obama's denial. Next, include the Intelligence Committee's concerns, Chambliss and Feinstein's positions, and McCain's suggestion. Keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without extra details.

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me check that to see the structure. The example starts with Holder assigning prosecutors, mentions the leaks, Holder's statement, Obama's denial, the Intelligence Committee's concerns, Chambliss and Feinstein's positions, and McCain's suggestion. It ends with the focus on investigating and prosecuting leaks.

I should follow a similar structure but ensure it's within 200 words. Let me draft it:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida operation. Holder emphasized that such leaks compromise national security and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied any intentional leaks from the White House for political gain. Members of the Intelligence Committee are concerned, with Sen. Chambliss calling for a special counsel, while Sen. Feinstein is considering legislative changes. Sen. McCain suggested the leaks might be politically motivated to aid Obama's election, which the White House denies. The investigation aims to identify and prosecute those responsible for the leaks.

Wait, that's 103 words. Maybe I can add more details without exceeding 200. Let me include Holder's authorization to prosecute and consult with the Intelligence Community. Also, mention Feinstein's caution about the time a special counsel might take and her consideration of legislation. And McCain's point about the President not denying leaks from the White House.

Revised summary:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys, Ronald Machen Jr. and Rod Rosenstein, to investigate potential leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida operation. Holder emphasized that such leaks compromise national security and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied any intentional leaks from the White House for political gain. Members of the Intelligence Committee expressed concern, with Sen. Chambliss calling for a special counsel, while Sen. Feinstein considered legislative changes to address the issue quickly. Sen. McCain suggested the leaks might be politically motivated to aid Obama's election, which the White House denies. The investigation aims to identify and prosecute those responsible for the leaks, with Holder authorizing the attorneys to consult with the Intelligence Community and pursue all leads.

That's 123 words. I think that covers all the key points without being too lengthy. Let me make sure it's under 200 words and includes all necessary information.
