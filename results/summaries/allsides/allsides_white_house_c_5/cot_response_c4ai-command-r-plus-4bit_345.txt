SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has taken serious action against possible leaks of classified information by assigning two U.S. attorneys to investigate and prosecute criminal violations. This comes in response to concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, who united in their concern over sensitive national security details being leaked, including information about a secret terrorist kill list and an infiltration operation targeting al-Qaida. Holder emphasized that leaking classified information compromises the security of the country and its citizens, and it will not be tolerated. President Obama also struck back at critics, stating that the notion of his White House purposely releasing classified information is offensive and wrong. Senator John McCain has called for a special counsel, citing concerns about possible political calculations behind the leaks and gravely serious breaches of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
