SUMMARY:

Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information, including details about a secret terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation that infiltrated al-Qaida. The move comes amid intensifying calls for an investigation into how sensitive national security details were leaked to the media. Holder emphasized that the leaking of classified information "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also denied accusations that the White House leaked classified material for political gain, calling the notion "offensive" and "wrong." The Congressional Intelligence Committee has also expressed concern over the leaks, with some members calling for a special counsel to investigate. The moral imperative is clear: protecting national security and upholding the integrity of classified information is paramount, and those responsible for leaks must be held accountable.
