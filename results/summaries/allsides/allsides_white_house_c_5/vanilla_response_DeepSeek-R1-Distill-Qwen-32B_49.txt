Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General Holder assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks. Let me read through the article first.

Okay, Holder is assigning two U.S. attorneys, Machen and Rosenstein, to look into possible leaks of classified info. The leaks include a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration. He gave them full authority to prosecute and consult with intelligence community. 

President Obama denied any White House leaks for political gain. Holder emphasized the importance of preventing leaks to protect national security.

Then, the article mentions the Congressional Intelligence Committee's concerns. Sen. Chambliss wanted a special counsel, but Sen. Feinstein was hesitant because it takes too long and suggested legislation instead.

John McCain pointed out that some leaks might be from the White House and called for a special counsel.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Holder assigning the attorneys, mention the leaks, Holder's statement, Obama's denial, the committee's reactions, and McCain's comments. Keep it concise and cover all key points without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: Holder assigns prosecutors, leaks details, Obama's response, committee's concerns, Feinstein's stance, and McCain's call for a special counsel. Make sure each point is clear and flows well.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Maybe around 150-180 words. Okay, that should cover all the necessary information succinctly.
