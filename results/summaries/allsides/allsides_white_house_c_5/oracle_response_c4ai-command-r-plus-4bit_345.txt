SUMMARY: Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, following concerns raised by members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee and calls for a special counsel or prosecutor to handle the case. Holder stated that the leaking of classified information is a serious issue that "can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated." President Obama also addressed the accusations, stating that the notion that his White House would purposely release classified information is "offensive" and "wrong." U.S. Attorneys Machen and Rosenstein have been given full authority to prosecute any criminal violations discovered during their investigations and to follow leads within the Executive and Legislative branches. This decision comes amid concerns that the leaks, which included sensitive details about national security matters, may have been calculated to boost the election prospects of President Obama, an allegation that has been strongly denied by the White House. Senator McCain has continued to call for a special counsel to investigate and prosecute these serious breaches of national security. END OF SUMMARY.
