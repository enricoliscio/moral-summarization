Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Attorney General assigning prosecutors to investigate leaks. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the main points are that Eric Holder is assigning two U.S. attorneys, Machen and Rosenstein, to look into leaks of classified info. The leaks include a secret terrorist kill list and an al-Qaida infiltration operation. Holder's statement emphasizes that these leaks can compromise national security and won't be tolerated. He gave the prosecutors full authority to prosecute and consult with intelligence agencies.

Then, President Obama denied that the White House intentionally leaked info for political gain. Critics, like McCain, think the leaks might be politically motivated to help Obama's election chances. Feinstein is considering legislation to give inspectors general more power, instead of a special counsel which could take too long.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Holder assigning the prosecutors, the types of leaks, and the impact on security. Then, include Obama's denial and the political angle from McCain. Finally, note Feinstein's stance on legislation versus a special counsel.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too detailed. Let me check the word count as I go.

Holder emphasized that such leaks compromise national security and will not be tolerated. President Obama denied accusations that the White House intentionally leaked classified material for political gain. Critics, including Sen.
