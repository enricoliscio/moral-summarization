SUMMARY: 
Attorney General Eric Holder has assigned two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible leaks of classified information, which have been criticized as potentially compromising national security and accused of being politically motivated. The investigation was prompted by calls from members of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, who expressed concern over recent leaks of sensitive details about a terrorist kill list and an intelligence operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. President Obama has denied any wrongdoing by the White House, stating that the notion of purposely releasing classified information is offensive and wrong. Senator John McCain has suggested that the leaks may have been calculated to boost the election prospects of President Obama, a claim that the White House vehemently denies. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chairwoman, is considering proposing legislation to enhance the investigative authority of inspectors general in response to these gravely serious breaches of national security.
