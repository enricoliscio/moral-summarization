SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate is uncertain in the Republican-led Senate, where many members have shifted away from supporting the DREAM Act due to concerns over "amnesty" and border security. In the past, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, but the party's conservative wing has increasingly viewed it as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion". Even Republicans who personally support the bill are hesitant to back it due to political risks and polarization within the party. The White House and most Republicans are instead pushing for a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House but faces significant hurdles in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
