SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the fate of Dreamers now rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. The DREAM Act used to be accepted by a wide range of Republicans who saw it as an act of "compassion," but the party has since backed away, with an increasing number viewing it as "amnesty." The bill stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate, as polarization has intensified and senators see little payoff in supporting it. The shift in the Republican position has been dramatic, with even supporters of the DREAM Act, like Sen. Marco Rubio, now taking a hard-line stance on immigration. The stand-alone House bill to protect Dreamers is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, as it will be amended and used as a vehicle for multiple amendments outside of the DREAM Act. This highlights the challenges of finding a comprehensive solution to the complex issue of immigration.
END OF SUMMARY.
