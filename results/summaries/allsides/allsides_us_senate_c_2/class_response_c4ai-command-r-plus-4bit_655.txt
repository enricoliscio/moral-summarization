SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the fate of these Dreamers now rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. The DREAM Act used to be accepted by a wide range of Republicans who believed it was wrong to punish children for their parents' actions. However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea as the party's conservative wing began viewing it as an act of "amnesty." The shift in the Republican stance has left Dreamers in legal limbo, with little chance of a stand-alone bill passing in the current Senate GOP caucus. Former Senator Richard Lugar, a long-time supporter of the DREAM Act, said that Republicans agonized between their personal beliefs and their political concerns over "amnesty." The dilemma has only become more acute as polarization within the party has intensified. Some Republicans, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, still advocate for a comprehensive solution, but others believe a stand-alone bill has no chance without concessions on border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, co-sponsored by over 190 Democrats, would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, whose home countries have been ravaged by war or natural disasters. Despite support from Democrats, the bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate, with few expecting a clean vote on any immigration issue.
