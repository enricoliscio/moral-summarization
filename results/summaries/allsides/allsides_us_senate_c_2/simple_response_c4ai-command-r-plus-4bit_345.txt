SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are dire. The DREAM Act, which once had support from a wide range of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has gradually lost support within the party as the more conservative wing has come to view it as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The number of Republican co-sponsors has steadily declined, and most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end the DACA program in 2017, which was blocked by federal courts. The shift in the Republican Party's stance on the DREAM Act is attributed to increasing polarization within the party and the influence of the conservative base, leaving senators hesitant to support the bill despite their personal beliefs. Senators like Richard Lugar, R-Ind., have acknowledged the internal struggle within the party, and some have suggested that a comprehensive solution that includes border security or changes to the legal immigration system may be more feasible. The House bill, co-sponsored by over 190 Democrats, faces an uphill battle in the Senate, with even former supporters like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressing doubts about its chances. The moral dilemma faced by Republicans, between their personal beliefs and political concerns, highlights the complexity of the immigration debate in the United States.
