SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these individuals rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. In the past, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, viewing it as an act of "compassion" rather than "amnesty." But over time, the GOP has backed away from the idea, and now most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support a stand-alone bill to protect Dreamers. They argue that it's a situation where members decide it's not an issue they're prepared to "bleed and die" on, and instead, they want to tie a Dreamer fix to billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo, and their home countries "ravaged" by war or natural disasters.

END OF SUMMARY.
