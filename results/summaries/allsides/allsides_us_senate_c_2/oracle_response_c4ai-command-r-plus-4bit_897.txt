SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-led Senate. The DREAM Act, once supported by a wide range of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, has seen dwindling support from the GOP over the years as the party's conservative wing has come to view it as "amnesty." The bill would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status, allowing them to legally live and work in the USA after their home countries were ravaged by war or natural disasters. Despite federal courts blocking attempts to end DACA and TPS, the prospects for the bill in the Senate appear dire. Senators, such as Richard Lugar, have agonized between their personal beliefs and political concerns, ultimately deciding that supporting the bill is not worth the political risk. Senators like Marco Rubio believe that a stand-alone bill has no chance in the Senate and that any immigration bill will be amended and used as a vehicle for multiple amendments. This moral dilemma over protecting Dreamers has intensified polarization within the Republican Party, leaving the fate of Dreamers uncertain. 

END OF SUMMARY.
