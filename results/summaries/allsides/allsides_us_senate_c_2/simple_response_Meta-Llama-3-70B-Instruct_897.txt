SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. Despite initial bipartisan support for the DREAM Act, the GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The party's more conservative wing has intensified polarization, leaving senators seeing little payoff to support the bill and many risks. Many Republicans now endorse a Dreamer fix only in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, which would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, is likely to sail through the Democratic-controlled House but stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
