Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible from the list provided. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about House Democrats introducing a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers. The bill's fate is in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to support such measures due to internal conflicts and a shift towards a more conservative stance. The DREAM Act, which was once supported by many Republicans, has seen declining support over the years as the party moved away from what was seen as "compassion" towards "amnesty." 

The article mentions the 2003 version of the DREAM Act with 12 GOP co-sponsors, which decreased over time until 2011 when there were none. In 2017, most Senate Republicans supported Trump ending DACA, which was then blocked by courts, leading to the current push by House Democrats. The bill, the Dream and Promise Act, would offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with TPS. However, it's unlikely to pass in the Senate, as Republicans now require border security funding or immigration system changes in exchange for supporting the bill. Senators like Rubio and Graham express doubts about the bill's chances, highlighting the difficulty in passing immigration legislation due to amendments and political risks.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided: unfair, end, protected, intensified, exchange, allowed, ravaged, war, disasters, blocked, killed, beating, embrace, protect, becomes, use, fall.

I should incorporate these words into the summary while keeping it concise and under 200 words. The summary needs to highlight the moral aspects, such as the unfairness of punishing children for their parents' actions, the protection of Dreamers, the intensification of party polarization, the exchange for border security, the allowed status under TPS, the ravaged home countries, the blocked attempts, the killed bills, the beating Rubio took, the embrace of amnesty, the protection efforts, the use of amendments, and the falling apart of bills.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing the bill, then the Senate's struggle, the shift in Republican support, the consequences of not passing the bill, and the challenges in the Senate. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I don't exceed 200 words and include as many of the specified words as possible without forcing them unnaturally.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to support such measures due to internal conflicts and a shift towards a more conservative stance. Once seen as an act of "compassion," the DREAM Act has faced declining GOP support, with co-sponsors dropping from 12 in 2003 to none by 2011. In 2017, most Senate Republicans supported President Trump ending DACA, which was blocked by courts, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. The new bill, which would offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), faces dire prospects in the Senate. Republicans now demand an exchange for border security funding or immigration system changes. Senators like Marco Rubio, once part of a bipartisan effort to reform immigration, now oppose standalone bills, fearing amendments and political risks. The moral framing highlights the unfairness of punishing children for their parents' actions, the intensification of polarization, and the difficulty of passing immigration legislation due to amendments and risks. END OF SUMMARY.
