SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. In the past, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, viewing it as an act of "compassion" rather than "amnesty". But as the party's conservative wing intensified, they began to back away from the idea, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. The bill's prospects in the current Senate GOP caucus appear dire, with many Republicans unwilling to support a stand-alone Dreamer bill, fearing it will be amended and become a vehicle for multiple amendments. This has led to a situation where senators see little payoff in supporting the DREAM Act and all kinds of risks. The morally charged debate has left Dreamers unprotected and ravaged by the uncertainty of their fate.
