SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but its fate now rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. The DREAM Act, once accepted by a wide range of Republicans as a compassionate act to protect Dreamers from punishment for their parents' actions, has seen dwindling support within the party over the years. The shift in stance can be attributed to the party's conservative wing viewing the act as "amnesty" rather than an act of compassion. This has resulted in a decreasing number of Republican co-sponsors for the bill. The situation has been further complicated by polarization within the Republican Party, leaving senators reluctant to support the DREAM Act due to the associated risks and little payoff. The White House and most Republicans are now endorsing a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security enhancements or changes to the legal immigration system. The stand-alone House bill to protect Dreamers is unlikely to pass in the Senate, according to Sen. Marco Rubio, due to the potential for amendments that could derail the bill. This article highlights the moral dilemma faced by Republicans, weighing compassion for Dreamers against the political concerns of supporting amnesty.
END OF SUMMARY.
