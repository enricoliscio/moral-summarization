Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I have to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The DREAM Act used to have bipartisan support but has lost support as the GOP became more conservative, viewing it as amnesty. The article mentions the shift in Republican stance, the role of border security, and the challenges in passing the bill in the Senate.

Now, I need to identify the key moral words: punish, protected, entitled, die, protect, ravaged, killed, bring, amended, amendments, use, amend. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too long, around 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning the bill introduced by House Democrats, using "protected" and "entitled." Then, I'll note the Senate's resistance, using "punish" and "amnesty." I'll mention the shift in the GOP's stance, using "ravaged" metaphorically for the change in their support. I'll include how the bill is seen as risky for senators, using "die" metaphorically for political careers. I'll explain the Senate's preference for a comprehensive solution over a standalone bill, using "amend" and "amendments." Finally, I'll note the challenges in passing the bill, using "protect" again.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral language. I'll structure it to show the introduction of the bill, the Senate's stance, the reasons for their resistance, and the implications for the Dreamers.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to Dreamers, but its fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly viewed the DREAM Act as "amnesty" rather than compassion. Once supported by many Republicans, the bill has seen declining GOP backing over the years. Senate Republicans now prioritize border security or immigration system overhauls in exchange for Dreamer protections. The bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status, but its prospects in the Senate are dire. Sen. Roy Blunt and others doubt its chances, while Sen. Lindsey Graham advocates for a broader immigration solution. Sen. Marco Rubio, once part of the bipartisan "Gang of 8," now opposes a standalone bill, fearing amendments and political fallout. The shift reflects growing polarization, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo and facing potential punishment for their parents' actions. END OF SUMMARY.
