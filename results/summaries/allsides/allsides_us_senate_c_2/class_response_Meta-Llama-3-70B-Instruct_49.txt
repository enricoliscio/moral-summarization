SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate lies in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. Once, the DREAM Act was accepted by many Senate Republicans who believed it was unfair to punish children for their parents' actions. However, as the party's conservative wing viewed the act as "amnesty" rather than "compassion," they backed away from the idea. Today, most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support the bill, fearing political risks and seeing little payoff. Even those who personally believe Dreamers are entitled to citizenship are hesitant to take a stand, fearing they will be ravaged by their own party. Instead, they propose a Dreamer fix only in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The bill is likely to sail through the Democratic-controlled House but stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
