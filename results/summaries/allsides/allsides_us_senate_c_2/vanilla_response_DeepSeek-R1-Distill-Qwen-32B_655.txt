Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the DREAM Act and the current situation in Congress. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are the ones who will decide its fate. It mentions the history of the DREAM Act, how Senate Republicans used to support it but now are backing away due to the conservative wing viewing it as amnesty. The bill's prospects in the Senate look dire because of internal conflicts and the GOP's shift towards more hard-line positions.

I should note the key points: the introduction of the bill by House Democrats, the historical support from Republicans that has waned, the role of border security and immigration system changes as conditions for support, and the challenges in the Senate.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence without getting too detailed. I'll focus on the current status, the Senate's stance, historical context, and the challenges faced by the bill.

SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, but its fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly distanced themselves from the DREAM Act due to conservative opposition. Once supported by many Republicans, the bill has seen declining GOP backing as the party shifted toward viewing it as "amnesty." Senate Republicans now prioritize border security and immigration system changes over standalone Dreamer protections. The bill, which also addresses Temporary Protected Status recipients, is unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate, as many senators view it as politically risky. END OF SUMMARY.
