SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but the bill's fate in the Republican-led Senate is uncertain. Support for the DREAM Act among Senate Republicans has diminished over time due to the party's conservative wing viewing it as "amnesty." The bill currently stands little chance in the Senate, with many Republicans endorsing a Dreamer fix only in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in Republican support for the DREAM Act has been attributed to polarization within the party and concerns over supporting "amnesty." Sen. Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now believes a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance in the Senate due to the likelihood of amendments. The House bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status. While it is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Senate are uncertain.
END OF SUMMARY.
