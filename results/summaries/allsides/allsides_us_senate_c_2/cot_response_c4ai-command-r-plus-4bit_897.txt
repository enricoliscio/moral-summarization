STEP 1:
*compassion

SUMMARY:
Senate Republicans are struggling to decide whether to support a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. Once a widely accepted idea, the DREAM Act has become increasingly polarizing within the Republican Party, with some viewing it as an act of "compassion" while others see it as "amnesty." The internal battle has left senators reluctant to support the bill, fearing the political consequences of appearing to support "amnesty." Despite many Republicans personally believing that Dreamers are entitled to citizenship, they are unwilling to "bleed and die" on this issue. Instead, they endorse a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, co-sponsored by over 190 Democrats, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). While it is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are dire due to the party's shift on immigration. The Cuban-American Senator Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now takes a hard-line stance and believes the stand-alone House bill has no chance in the Senate. The fate of Dreamers remains uncertain as Republicans struggle to balance their moral and political concerns.
