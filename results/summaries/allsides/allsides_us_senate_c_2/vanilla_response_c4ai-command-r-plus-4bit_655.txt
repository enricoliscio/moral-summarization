SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act, a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are uncertain due to the shifting political landscape and the party's more conservative wing viewing the bill as "amnesty." The DREAM Act used to have bipartisan support, but the number of Republican co-sponsors has decreased over the years. Senate Republicans are now more focused on border security and changing the legal immigration system, and some believe that a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance of passing. The immigration landscape has changed, and some Republicans believe that a comprehensive solution is needed rather than a stand-alone bill. The House bill faces challenges in the Senate due to the potential for multiple amendments, and the internal battle within the Republican Party between personal beliefs and political concerns over "amnesty." The shifting political landscape and polarization within the Republican Party have made it challenging to find a solution that satisfies all sides.
END OF SUMMARY.
