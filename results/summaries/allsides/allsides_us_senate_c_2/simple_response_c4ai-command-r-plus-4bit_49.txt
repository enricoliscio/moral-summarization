SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate rests with Senate Republicans who have struggled to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. The DREAM Act once had broad GOP support as an act of "compassion," but that has shifted as the party's conservative wing now views it as "amnesty." The number of Republican co-sponsors has steadily declined, and most Senate Republicans supported Trump's decision to end DACA, an Obama-era program protecting Dreamers. The bill's prospects in the current Senate GOP caucus appear dire as senators weigh political risks and see little payoff in supporting it. Some Republicans endorse a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to legal immigration, while others acknowledge the shift in their party's stance on immigration. The House bill, co-sponsored by over 190 Democrats, faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate, highlighting the challenges of finding a bipartisan solution to immigration reform. Despite some Republican support for Dreamers, the stand-alone House bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate due to concerns about amendments and the complex dynamics of immigration politics.
END OF SUMMARY.
