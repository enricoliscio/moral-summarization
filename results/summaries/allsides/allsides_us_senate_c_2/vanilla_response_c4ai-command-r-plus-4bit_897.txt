SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is uncertain due to the party's shift in stance on the issue. Previously, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, but the number of GOP co-sponsors has decreased over time as the party's conservative wing views it as "amnesty." Most Senate Republicans now support a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The article highlights the challenges of finding a solution due to polarization within the Republican Party and the risk of amendments to any immigration-related bill. Sen. Marco Rubio, a former supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, predicts that the stand-alone House bill will not pass in the Senate due to the likelihood of amendments. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, reflecting the challenges of addressing immigration reform in a polarized political environment.
END OF SUMMARY.
