SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the bill's fate now rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. The DREAM Act once had broad support from Republicans who believed it was wrong to punish children for their parents' actions, but that support has waned as the party's conservative wing has come to view the act as "amnesty." The number of Republican co-sponsors has steadily decreased since 2003, and most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, which protected Dreamers from deportation. Federal courts blocked that decision, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo and prompting the House Democrats' bill. However, the bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate, where few senators are willing to "bleed and die" for the issue, and many prefer to link Dreamer protections to border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in the Republican stance on immigration has made it difficult to find a clean vote on any immigration issue, as senators use bills as vehicles for their own amendments, causing them to fall apart. The Cuban-American Senator Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now believes that a stand-alone bill to protect Dreamers has no chance in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
