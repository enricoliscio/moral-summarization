Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The author highlights the shift in the GOP's stance from supporting the DREAM Act to opposing it, influenced by the conservative wing. I should focus on the moral aspects, like compassion vs. amnesty, and the political struggles. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the key points without losing the moral perspective. Let me structure it by mentioning the bill, the Senate's role, the historical context of GOP support, the current opposition, and the political risks senators face. I'll also include Rubio's comments on the bill's chances. Making sure the summary flows logically and highlights the moral dilemma.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, but Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. Once widely supported by Republicans as an act of compassion, the DREAM Act has seen declining GOP backing as the party's conservative wing increasingly views it as amnesty. Over the years, Republican co-sponsors of the bill have dwindled, and by 2017, most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end DACA. The bill's prospects in the Senate are dire, as many Republicans now demand border security funding or immigration system changes in exchange for Dreamer protections. Sen. Lindsey Graham supports a comprehensive solution, while Sen. Roy Blunt remains non-committal. The House bill, co-sponsored by 190 Democrats, would offer citizenship pathways to Dreamers and TPS recipients, but it faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate. Sen. Marco Rubio, once part of a bipartisan immigration reform effort, now opposes the standalone bill, citing political gridlock. The moral framing highlights the struggle between compassion for Dreamers and political concerns over amnesty, reflecting the GOP's internal polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
