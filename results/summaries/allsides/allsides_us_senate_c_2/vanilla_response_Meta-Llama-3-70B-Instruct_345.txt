SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate is uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. In the past, the DREAM Act had bipartisan support, but over time, Republicans have backed away from the idea, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." Today, most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support a stand-alone bill, instead wanting to tie a Dreamer fix to border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. Even Republicans who have historically supported the DREAM Act, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, are now hesitant to back a stand-alone bill. The bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House but faces significant opposition in the Republican-led Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
