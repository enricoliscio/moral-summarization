Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, and the challenges it faces in the Senate. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, often indicating approval or disapproval. For example, words like "unfair," "compassion," "amnesty," "bleed and die," etc., are likely candidates.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that have a moral charge. Words like "unfair," "compassion," "amnesty," "protection," "justice," "fairness," "opportunity," "entitled," "risk," "compromise," "betrayal," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring," "fairness," "compassion," "rights," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring," "fairness," "compassion," "rights," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring," "fairness," "compassion," "rights," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring," "fairness," "compassion," "rights," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring," "fairness," "compassion," "rights," "fairness," "opportunity," "hope," "caring,"
