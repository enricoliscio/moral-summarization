SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of this bill rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. Despite initial support from some Republicans, the party's more conservative wing has viewed the DREAM Act as "amnesty" rather than an act of compassion, leading to a drastic decline in support. Today, most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support the bill, citing concerns over border security and wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. Even vocal supporters of the DREAM Act, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, are hesitant to back a stand-alone bill. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the GOP's shift towards a more hard-line stance on immigration has led to a lack of compassion and a willingness to punish children for their parents' actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
