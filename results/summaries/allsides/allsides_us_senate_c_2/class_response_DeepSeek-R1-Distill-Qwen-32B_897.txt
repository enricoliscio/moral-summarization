Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the DREAM Act and its journey through the Senate, highlighting the shift in Republican support over time. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. House Democrats introduced a bill to protect Dreamers, but Senate Republicans are hesitant. The DREAM Act used to have bipartisan support, but as the GOP became more conservative, support dwindled. Now, the Senate is unlikely to pass the bill, with many Republicans wanting border security in exchange for any Dreamer protections.

Next, the user specified that I must preserve the morally framed words they listed: punish, protected, entitled, die, protect, ravaged, killed, bring, amended, amendments, use, amend. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary without losing their moral connotations.

I should start by outlining the main events: introduction of the bill, historical support from Republicans, the shift in stance, and the current Senate situation. I'll need to weave in the moral terms naturally. For example, "punish children for their parents' actions" and "protected from deportation" are key points.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll mention the decline in Republican co-sponsors over the years, the end of DACA, and the current Senate's reluctance. Highlighting the internal conflict within the GOP and the risks senators perceive will show the moral dilemma.

I should ensure that each morally framed word is used contextually. For instance, "protected" when talking about DACA and "amended" when discussing the legislative process. I'll also mention how the bill is seen as "amnesty" by conservatives, which ties into the moral framing.

Finally, I'll conclude by noting the slim chances of the bill passing in the Senate, emphasizing the political and moral challenges faced. Making sure the summary flows logically while incorporating all the required moral terms is crucial.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, but Senate Republicans remain hesitant. Once widely supported by Republicans as an act of compassion, the DREAM Act has faced growing opposition as the party shifted toward viewing it as "amnesty." Over the years, Republican co-sponsors of the bill declined, from 12 in 2003 to none by 2011. In 2017, most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end DACA, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Senate Republicans now see little payoff in supporting the bill, fearing political risks. Sen. Roy Blunt expressed support for Dreamers but declined to commit to voting for the bill. Many Republicans now demand border security or immigration system changes in exchange for Dreamer protections. Sen. Lindsey Graham called for a "more comprehensive solution," while Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the standalone bill, citing risks of amendments. The House bill, the Dream and Promise Act, would create a citizenship pathway for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). However, its prospects in the Senate are dire, as Republicans remain divided and cautious. END OF SUMMARY.
