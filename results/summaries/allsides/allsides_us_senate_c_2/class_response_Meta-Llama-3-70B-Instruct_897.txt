SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. In the past, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, viewing it as an act of "compassion" rather than "amnesty." But as the party's conservative wing gained influence, they began to see it as an act of "amnesty," and support dwindled. Today, most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support the bill, fearing political backlash and seeing little payoff in supporting the DREAM Act. They would rather use the bill as a vehicle for multiple amendments, which would ultimately kill the legislation. The morally fraught language used in the article highlights the internal battle within the Republican Party, where members are torn between their personal belief that Dreamers are "entitled" to citizenship and their political concerns over supporting "amnesty."
