Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. It mentions the DREAM Act's history, how Senate Republicans used to support it but now oppose it because of the conservative wing seeing it as amnesty. The bill's prospects are dire in the Senate because of polarization and internal party conflicts.

I should highlight the shift in Republican stance from compassion to opposing amnesty. Also, the legal limbo Dreamers are in due to DACA being blocked. Mention the House bill's chances in the Senate and the required trade-offs for any immigration fix.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the moral aspects, like the struggle between compassion and political concerns. Make sure to note the opposition from Rubio and others, emphasizing the difficulty in passing the bill.

Let me structure this: start with the bill introduction, mention the Senate's role, historical context of Republican support, the shift, current opposition, and the challenges in the Senate. Keep it concise but cover all key points.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, but its fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed such measures due to internal polarization. Once widely supported by Senate Republicans as an act of compassion, the DREAM Act has seen declining GOP backing, with conservative factions viewing it as "amnesty." Over the years, Republican co-sponsorship has dwindled, and by 2017, most Senate Republicans supported ending DACA, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Senate Republicans now face a tough choice between their personal beliefs in protecting Dreamers and political concerns over appearing lenient on immigration. The House bill, the Dream and Promise Act, is unlikely to pass the Senate, as many Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, oppose standalone measures, fearing amendments that could derail the bill. The immigration debate remains deeply polarized, with little room for compromise. END OF SUMMARY.
