SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate is uncertain in the Republican-led Senate, where many members have shifted away from supporting the DREAM Act in recent years. In the past, the bill had bipartisan support, but now many Republicans view it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." Even Republican senators who previously supported the bill are now hesitant to back it, citing political risks and the need for a more comprehensive solution. The White House and most Republicans want a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
