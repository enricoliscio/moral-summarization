SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are dire. The DREAM Act, which once had bipartisan support, has become increasingly polarized along party lines, with Senate Republicans struggling to balance their personal beliefs with the more conservative views of their base.

Former Senator Richard Lugar, a long-time supporter of the DREAM Act, notes that Republicans have agonized over the issue for years, caught between their personal belief in citizenship for Dreamers and their political concerns over "amnesty." This internal battle has only intensified as polarization within the Republican Party has increased. As a result, senators see little political gain in supporting the DREAM Act and fear the risks of doing so.

Some Republicans, like Senator Lindsey Graham, have suggested seeking a more comprehensive solution rather than a stand-alone bill for Dreamers. However, the White House and most Republicans have tied Dreamer protections to border security funding or changes to the legal immigration system. The Cuban-American Senator Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now believes that a stand-alone bill for Dreamers has no chance in the Senate due to the complex and divisive nature of immigration politics.
