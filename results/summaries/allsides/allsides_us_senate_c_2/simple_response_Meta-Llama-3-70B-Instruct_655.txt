SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the DREAM Act, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." Even Republicans who once supported the bill now see little payoff in supporting it, and instead demand border security or changes to the legal immigration system in exchange for a Dreamer fix. The bill has little chance in the Republican-led Senate, with many senators saying it will be amended and fall apart. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the GOP's shift towards a more hard-line stance on immigration has led to a lack of compassion and a failure to protect vulnerable individuals who were brought to the US as children.

END OF SUMMARY.
