SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate is uncertain in the Republican-led Senate, where many members have shifted away from supporting the DREAM Act over the years. In the past, the bill had bipartisan support, but now many Republicans view it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." Senate Republicans are unlikely to support a stand-alone bill, instead wanting to tie it to border security or immigration system changes. Even some Republicans who have historically supported the DREAM Act, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, now say it has no chance in the Senate. The bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, but its prospects in the Senate appear dire.

END OF SUMMARY.
