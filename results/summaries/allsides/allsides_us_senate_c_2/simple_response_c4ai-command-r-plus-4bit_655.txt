SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate rests with Senate Republicans who have struggled to find a solution acceptable to their conservative base. The DREAM Act once had broad GOP support, but that has eroded as the party's conservative wing has come to view it as "amnesty." The bill now stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate, with few senators willing to support it despite their personal beliefs. This shift is due to polarization within the Republican Party and the belief that supporting the DREAM Act carries political risks with little payoff. Senators like Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio acknowledge the need to protect Dreamers but advocate for a more comprehensive solution, linking Dreamer protections to border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, co-sponsored by over 190 Democrats, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status. While it is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, the moral dilemma faced by senators leaves its prospects in the Senate dim.
END OF SUMMARY.
