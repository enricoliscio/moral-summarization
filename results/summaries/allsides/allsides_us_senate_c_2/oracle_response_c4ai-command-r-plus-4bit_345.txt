SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is less certain. The DREAM Act used to have support from a wide range of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, who sponsored the 2003 version of the bill. However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea, with an increasing number of Republicans viewing it as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The shift in the Republican Party's stance has left senators struggling between their personal beliefs and political concerns, with few willing to take a stand on the issue. The White House and most Republicans have endorsed a Dreamer fix only in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, a program that has allowed people from countries ravaged by war or natural disasters to legally live and work in the US. While the bill is expected to pass in the House, it faces an uphill battle in the Senate, with even previous supporters like Sen. Marco Rubio now taking a hard-line stance on immigration. The stand-alone bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, as it will likely be amended and used as a vehicle for multiple amendments outside of the DREAM Act.
END OF SUMMARY.
