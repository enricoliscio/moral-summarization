SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill that aims to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. The bill, called the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), who have been displaced due to war or natural disasters. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is uncertain. Historically, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, recognizing that it was unfair to punish children for their parents' actions. However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea as the party's conservative wing has come to view it as "amnesty." Today, most Senate Republicans oppose a stand-alone Dreamer bill and instead support linking protections for Dreamers to border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in the Republican Party's stance on immigration has made it challenging to find a comprehensive solution that satisfies all sides. The Cuban-American Senator Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now believes that a stand-alone bill to protect Dreamers has no chance in the Senate due to the likelihood of amendments that could derail the bill. The fate of Dreamers remains uncertain as the political landscape continues to polarize.
