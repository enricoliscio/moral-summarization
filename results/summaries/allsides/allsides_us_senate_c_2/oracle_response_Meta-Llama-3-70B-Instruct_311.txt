SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than an act of "compassion." The party's internal battle has intensified, leaving senators seeing little payoff to support the bill and many risks. Republicans like Sen. Roy Blunt and Sen. Lindsey Graham are hesitant to support a stand-alone bill, instead wanting to exchange it for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The bill, which would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, is likely to pass the House but stands little chance in the Senate. The Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was blocked by federal courts, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. END OF SUMMARY.
