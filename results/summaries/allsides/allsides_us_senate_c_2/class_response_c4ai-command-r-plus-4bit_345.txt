SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. The bill, called the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), who have been ravaged by war or natural disasters in their home countries. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is less certain. Historically, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, believing it was unfair to punish children for their parents' actions. However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea, with an increasing number of conservatives viewing it as amnesty. Today, most Senate Republicans oppose a stand-alone Dreamer bill, instead advocating for border security or changes to the legal immigration system in exchange for Dreamer protections. The shift in the Republican Party's stance on immigration has made it difficult to find a comprehensive solution, and the Senate's current makeup suggests that the bill will face significant challenges. The Cuban-American Senator Marco Rubio, once a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, now believes that a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance in the Senate, as it will be amended and used as a vehicle for various immigration amendments. The fate of Dreamers, who are entitled to protection and a chance at citizenship, hangs in the balance as the political battle over immigration rages on.
