SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the bill's fate rests with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed the DREAM Act over the years. Once widely accepted, the Act is now viewed by many Republicans as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The party's conservative wing has pressured lawmakers to abandon support for the bill, and even former supporters like Sen. Marco Rubio have taken a harder stance on immigration. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, with many Republicans demanding border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system in exchange for supporting the Dreamer fix. The moral imperative to protect Dreamers, who were brought to the US as children and have lived here for years, is being outweighed by political concerns and a desire to appease a conservative base.
