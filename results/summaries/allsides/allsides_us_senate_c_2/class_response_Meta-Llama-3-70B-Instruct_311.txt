SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to come up with a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. The DREAM Act, once accepted by many Senate Republicans, is now viewed as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The GOP has backed away from the idea, and the tide has changed drastically since 2017. Senate Republicans are unlikely to support the bill, fearing political risks and seeing little payoff. They would rather exchange a Dreamer fix for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the importance of protecting and not punishing innocent children, and the need for compassion and fairness in immigration policy.
