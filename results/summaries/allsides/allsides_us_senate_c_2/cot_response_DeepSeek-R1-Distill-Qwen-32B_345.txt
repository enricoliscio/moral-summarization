Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. The task is to first identify morally framed words and then summarize the article preserving those moral terms. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about the DREAM Act and how Senate Republicans have changed their stance over time. The author uses words that carry moral connotations, like "compassion," "amnesty," "fairness," etc. 

For the first step, I need to extract all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that imply values or judgments. Words like "unfair," "compassion," "amnesty," "bleed and die," "pro," "changed," "give," "progress," "justified," "citizenship," "fairness," "mercy," "opportunity," "just," "fairly," "right," "fair shot," "opportunity," "justice," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness," "opportunity," "fairness,"
