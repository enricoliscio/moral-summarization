SUMMARY:
The introduction of a bill by House Democrats to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children highlights the moral dilemma faced by Senate Republicans. Once supported by a wide range of Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, the DREAM Act has gradually lost favor within the party as the conservative wing has shifted its perspective. The moral struggle between "compassion" and "amnesty" has long divided Republicans, with some, like Richard Lugar, supporting Dreamers' entitlement to citizenship while recognizing the political risks of endorsing "amnesty." This internal conflict has intensified as polarization within the Republican Party has increased, making it challenging for senators to support the DREAM Act without facing backlash. Sen. Roy Blunt acknowledges his support for Dreamers but remains noncommittal on the House bill, while others assert that a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance. Instead, Republicans favor a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in the Republican stance is exemplified by Sen. Marco Rubio, who once supported comprehensive immigration reform but has since adopted a harder line. The House bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate, underscoring the moral and political complexities surrounding immigration reform. END OF SUMMARY.
