SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are dire. Historically, the DREAM Act had support from a range of Senate Republicans, but that support has dwindled as the party's conservative wing has come to view it as "amnesty." The shift in the Republican Party's stance on immigration has made it difficult to find a solution that satisfies both the party and its conservative base. Some senators, like Richard Lugar, recognize the dilemma of supporting Dreamers without appearing to endorse "amnesty." Others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, advocate for a more comprehensive solution beyond the House bill. The stand-alone bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, according to Sen. Marco Rubio, due to the complex nature of immigration politics and the potential for amendments. The article highlights the challenges faced by Republicans in addressing the issue of Dreamers and the broader immigration debate.
