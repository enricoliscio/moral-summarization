Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand its main points.

The article discusses the introduction of a bill by House Democrats to grant permanent protections to Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans' stance is crucial. It traces the shift in the GOP's support for the DREAM Act over the years, noting how the party moved from supporting it as compassionate to opposing it as amnesty. The bill's prospects in the Senate look bleak due to internal conflicts and the demand for border security funding in exchange.

I should focus on highlighting the moral dilemma the GOP faces: between compassion for Dreamers and political concerns over amnesty. Also, the article mentions the internal battles within the Republican party, which is a key point to include.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the introduction of the bill, then the Senate's role, the shift in Republican support, the current challenges, and the internal party dynamics. I'll make sure to include the moral framing by emphasizing the conflict between compassion and political strategy.

Let me structure this: introduce the bill, mention the Senate's role, outline the Republican shift, discuss the current stance, and conclude with the internal party struggles and the bill's slim chances.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all these elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, but its fate hinges on Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed such measures due to concerns over "amnesty." Once widely supported by Republicans as an act of compassion, the DREAM Act has seen declining GOP backing as the party's conservative wing framed it as amnesty. Over the years, Republican co-sponsors of the bill dwindled, and by 2017, most Senate Republicans supported ending DACA, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Senate Republicans now face a moral dilemma: supporting Dreamers risks alienating their conservative base, while opposing them risks accusations of cruelty. Many senators view the issue as politically risky, with few willing to "bleed and die" for the DREAM Act. The bill's prospects in the Senate are dire, as Republicans demand border security funding or immigration system overhauls in exchange for support. Internal party divisions and the influence of hardliners like Sen. Marco Rubio have further complicated the situation, making a standalone Dreamer bill unlikely to pass. END OF SUMMARY.
