SUMMARY: The DREAM Act, once supported by a wide range of Senate Republicans as an act of *compassion* towards undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, has faced dwindling support within the GOP over the years. The shift in the Republican stance can be attributed to the party's conservative wing viewing the act less as an act of *compassion* and more as *amnesty*. This has left senators *agonized* between their personal beliefs and political concerns, seeing little incentive to support the act and facing various risks. Despite some senators expressing support for Dreamers, a stand-alone bill to protect them is unlikely to pass in the Senate. The House Democrats' recent bill to grant permanent protections to Dreamers faces opposition from Republicans who endorse a Dreamer fix in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shifting stance of Republicans on the DREAM Act highlights the increasing polarization within the party and the challenges of reaching a *comprehensive* solution for *progress*. The hard-line stance of some Republicans, like Marco Rubio, who was once part of the bipartisan "Gang of 8," further illustrates the complexities of immigration reform.
