SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, but its fate rests with Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. The DREAM Act, once supported by many Senate Republicans, has seen its support dwindle as the party's conservative wing views it as "amnesty" rather than "compassion." Even Republicans who personally believe Dreamers deserve citizenship are hesitant to support the bill due to political concerns and polarization within the party. Many Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, are instead pushing for a more comprehensive solution that includes border security and changes to the legal immigration system. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, with few Republicans willing to take a stand on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
