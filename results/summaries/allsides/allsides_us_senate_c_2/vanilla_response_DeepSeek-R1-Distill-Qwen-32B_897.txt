Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. 

The article mentions the DREAM Act's history, how it had support from some Republicans in the past but now faces opposition. It talks about how the GOP has become more conservative, viewing the act as amnesty rather than compassion. There are details about the number of Republican co-sponsors decreasing over the years. 

It also discusses the DACA program, which was ended by Trump but blocked by courts, leaving Dreamers in limbo. The House bill, called the Dream and Promise Act, includes pathways to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS holders. However, the Senate is unlikely to pass it because of the party's internal divisions and the requirement for a comprehensive solution, possibly involving border security.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: the introduction of the bill by House Democrats, the Senate's unlikely passage due to Republican opposition, the history of the DREAM Act's support, the shift in the GOP's stance, the DACA situation, the contents of the new bill, and the challenges it faces in the Senate.

I should make sure to mention key figures like Sen. Orrin Hatch, Richard Lugar, Roy Blunt, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio, as they represent different perspectives within the Republican party. Also, the mention of the TPS program and the 300,000 people it affects is important.

I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the introduction of the bill, then the historical context, the current Senate situation, and the challenges faced. I should avoid getting too bogged down in details but ensure all critical points are covered succinctly.

Let me start drafting: House Democrats introduced a bill to protect Dreamers, but Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The DREAM Act had bipartisan support earlier but lost GOP backing as the party became more conservative. DACA was ended by Trump but blocked by courts. The new bill includes citizenship pathways for Dreamers and TPS holders. Senate Republicans prefer a comprehensive approach, making passage unlikely. Key senators express doubts or require additional measures, like border security, for support.

I think that covers the main points without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to include all the necessary elements and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate, where support for similar measures has waned over the years. Once backed by many Republicans, the DREAM Act has seen decreasing GOP support as the party shifted toward a more conservative stance, viewing it as amnesty rather than compassion. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected over 800,000 Dreamers, was ended by former President Trump but blocked by courts, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Senate Republicans, including Lindsey Graham and Roy Blunt, prefer a comprehensive immigration solution, making the standalone bill's passage unlikely. The bill, which would offer citizenship pathways for Dreamers and TPS holders, is unlikely to gain traction in the Senate due to internal divisions and the demand for border security or broader immigration reforms. END OF SUMMARY.
