SUMMARY:

House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these individuals rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than an act of "compassion." The party's shift is evident in the dwindling number of Republican co-sponsors for the DREAM Act over the years. Even senators who personally believe Dreamers are "entitled to citizenship" are hesitant to support the bill due to political concerns. The current Senate GOP caucus sees little payoff in supporting the DREAM Act and risks being "punish[ed]" by their base. Instead, they demand a comprehensive solution that includes border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, which would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, stands little chance in the Senate.

END OF SUMMARY.
