SUMMARY:
The moral dilemma faced by Republicans over the DREAM Act, which would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, was highlighted in a bill introduced by House Democrats. Originally, the DREAM Act garnered bipartisan support with Republicans like Sen. Orrin Hatch sponsoring it, framing it as a matter of "compassion." However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea as their conservative wing reframed it as "amnesty." This shift has left Republicans struggling between their personal beliefs and political concerns, with some senators like Richard Lugar agonizing over the decision. The polarization within the GOP has made it challenging to find a payoff for supporting the DREAM Act without bleeding and dying on the issue. Despite some senators' support for Dreamers, the stand-alone bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, with senators like Lindsey Graham advocating for a more comprehensive solution. Marco Rubio, who once supported comprehensive immigration reform, now believes a stand-alone bill has no chance due to the difficulty of getting a clean vote on immigration issues without amendments that could cause the bill to fall apart. The moral framing of the issue highlights the internal struggle within the GOP, reflecting a shift from "compassion" to "amnesty" and the challenges of finding a solution that balances moral and political concerns.
