SUMMARY:
House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. In the past, Senate Republicans like Sen. Orrin Hatch and Sen. Richard Lugar supported the DREAM Act as an act of "compassion," but as the party's conservative wing viewed it as "amnesty," they backed away. Today, most Senate Republicans see little payoff in supporting the DREAM Act and all kinds of "risks." They prefer a more comprehensive solution that includes billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, which would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
