SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these individuals will ultimately rest in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to come up with a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing it as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion". The tide has changed drastically, with most Senate Republicans supporting President Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected over 800,000 Dreamers from deportation. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, with many Republicans unwilling to support it due to political concerns. Even those who personally believe Dreamers are entitled to citizenship see little payoff in supporting the bill and risk being seen as soft on immigration. The White House and most Republicans have endorsed a Dreamer fix only in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system.

END OF SUMMARY.
