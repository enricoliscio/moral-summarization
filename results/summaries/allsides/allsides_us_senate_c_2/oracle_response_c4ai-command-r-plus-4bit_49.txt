SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-led Senate. The DREAM Act, once supported by many Senate Republicans as a compassionate act, has become increasingly polarized within the party, with conservative wings viewing it as "amnesty." The number of Republican co-sponsors has steadily declined since the bill's introduction in 2003, and most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, which protected Dreamers. Federal courts blocked this decision, but Dreamers remain in legal limbo. The internal struggle within the Republican Party between personal beliefs and political concerns has intensified, making it difficult for senators to support the DREAM Act. The House bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with TPS, a program that has allowed foreigners to live and work in the US after their home countries were ravaged by war or natural disasters. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, it faces an uphill battle in the Senate, with many Republicans endorsing a Dreamer fix only in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in the Republican stance on immigration has made it challenging to find a comprehensive solution, and the stand-alone House bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate.
END OF SUMMARY.
