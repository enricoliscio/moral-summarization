SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill that would grant permanent protection to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is uncertain due to the shifting attitudes within the GOP. Once supported by a range of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, the DREAM Act has become increasingly polarizing within the party, with some viewing it as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The number of Republican co-sponsors has dwindled over the years, and most Senate Republicans supported President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, which protected Dreamers. The internal battle within the GOP between personal beliefs and political concerns has left senators reluctant to support the DREAM Act. According to Sen. Richard Lugar, members are not prepared to "bleed and die" on this issue. The White House and most Republicans have tied Dreamer protection to border security or changes to the legal immigration system, while others believe a more comprehensive solution is needed. The stand-alone House bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, according to Sen. Marco Rubio, due to the complexity of immigration issues. The moral framing in the article centers around the idea of protecting Dreamers, with words like "protect," "protected," and "die" emphasizing the potential harm and vulnerability faced by these individuals. The terms "punish," "entitled," "amended," and "amendments" highlight the political and legal struggles surrounding the DREAM Act, indicating a complex moral dilemma within the GOP.
END OF SUMMARY.
