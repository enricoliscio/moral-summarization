Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. 

First, the key points: The bill is called the Dream and Promise Act, introduced by House Democrats. It aims to give permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought here as children. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, is where the bill's fate lies. 

The article mentions the history of the DREAM Act, how it had support from some Republicans in the past but now faces opposition. The number of GOP co-sponsors decreased over the years, showing a shift in the party's stance. The 2017 decision by Trump to end DACA is also a significant point, which was blocked by courts, leading to the current push.

I should note that the bill includes Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders as well. The House is likely to pass it, but the Senate's Republican leaders are against it unless it's tied to border security or immigration system changes. Senators like Lindsey Graham want a comprehensive solution, while others like Marco Rubio oppose a standalone bill, fearing amendments that could derail it.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill's introduction, its purpose, and the Senate's role. Then mention the historical shift in Republican support, the DACA background, and the Senate's stance. Finally, touch on the bill's prospects and the reasons for Republican hesitation.

Let me make sure I include all essential elements without getting too detailed. Keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act, a bill to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children (Dreamers) and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The bill's fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed such measures due to ideological shifts within the party. Once supported by many Republicans, the DREAM Act lost backing as the GOP viewed it as "amnesty." Senate Republicans now demand border security funding or immigration system changes in exchange for supporting Dreamers. The bill, which includes a citizenship pathway for Dreamers and TPS holders, will likely pass the Democratic-controlled House but faces slim chances in the Republican-led Senate. Senators like Lindsey Graham advocate for a comprehensive immigration solution, while others, like Marco Rubio, oppose a standalone bill, fearing amendments that could derail it. END OF SUMMARY.
