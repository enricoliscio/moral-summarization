SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these individuals rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing it as "amnesty" rather than an act of "compassion". The party's more conservative wing has intensified its opposition, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Even Republicans who once supported the DREAM Act now see little payoff in supporting it, fearing political risks. The White House and most Republicans want a Dreamer fix only in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The House bill, which would create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and foreigners with Temporary Protected Status, stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate, where few are willing to "bleed and die" for the issue.
