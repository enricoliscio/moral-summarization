SUMMARY: House Democrats have introduced a bill that would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its fate in the Republican-led Senate is less certain, highlighting the moral dilemma faced by Republicans over the issue of immigration.

Historically, the DREAM Act had support from a significant number of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, who sponsored the 2003 version of the bill. However, the GOP has gradually backed away from the idea, with the number of Republican co-sponsors decreasing over time as the party's conservative wing began viewing the act as "amnesty" rather than an act of "compassion."

The shift in the Republican Party's stance on the DREAM Act can be attributed to increasing polarization within the party and the influence of the tea party movement, the Freedom Caucus, and former President Donald Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric. As a result, senators are reluctant to support the DREAM Act, fearing the political consequences of being associated with any form of "amnesty."

Some Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Marco Rubio, have acknowledged the need to protect Dreamers but advocate for a more comprehensive solution that addresses border security and legal immigration reforms. The House bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, faces an uphill battle in the Senate, underscoring the moral and political complexities surrounding immigration reform in today's polarized political landscape.
