Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about House Democrats introducing a bill for Dreamers, and the challenges they face in the Senate. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The bill is about granting permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought here as children. Senate Republicans have struggled with this issue, moving from supporting the DREAM Act to opposing it due to internal party divisions.

The author uses words like "unfair," "protected," "intensified," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I should focus on the shift in Republican stance, the internal battles, and the current Senate's resistance to the bill.

I'll start by outlining the key points: introduction of the bill, Senate's past support, the shift in party stance, the impact of DACA, and the current Senate's reluctance. Then, I'll incorporate the moral words where appropriate.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll mention the bill's goals, the historical context, the changes in Republican support, the consequences of ending DACA, and the challenges in the Senate.

I'll also include the points about border security and the comprehensive solution, as well as the mention of the TPS program and the political dynamics. Finally, I'll note Rubio's comments about the bill's chances.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure that the moral words are naturally integrated without forcing them. The summary should reflect the author's framing, emphasizing the unfairness and the struggle for protection.

SUMMARY:  
House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, but its fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have grown increasingly resistant. Once, Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, viewing it as a compassionate solution to punish children for their parents' actions. However, as the party's conservative wing labeled it "amnesty," GOP support waned. By 2017, most Senate Republicans backed President Trump's decision to end DACA, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. The House bill, the Dream and Promise Act, aims to create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but its prospects in the Senate are dire. Senate Republicans now demand border security funding or immigration system changes in exchange for support. Sen. Lindsey Graham called for a "more comprehensive solution," while Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed the standalone bill, warning it would be amended and fail. The shift reflects intensified polarization and GOP fears of political backlash, leaving Dreamers' protections uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
