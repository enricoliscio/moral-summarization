SUMMARY:
House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. In the past, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, viewing it as an act of "compassion" rather than "amnesty." But as the party's more conservative wing gained influence, they began to see it as an act of "amnesty," and support dwindled. Today, most Senate Republicans are unlikely to support a stand-alone bill, citing concerns over "amnesty" and the need for a more "comprehensive" solution that includes border security and changes to the legal immigration system. The bill's prospects in the Senate appear dire, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. END OF SUMMARY.
