Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. It mentions the DREAM Act's history, how Senate Republicans used to support it but now don't because of the conservative wing seeing it as amnesty. The bill's fate is uncertain because of internal conflicts in the GOP and the current political climate.

I should highlight the moral dilemma: compassion vs. political risks. The article talks about how some Republicans believe Dreamers deserve citizenship but are hesitant due to fears of being labeled as supporting amnesty. The internal battles within the GOP and the polarization are key points.

Also, the House bill is comprehensive, covering both Dreamers and TPS holders, but it's stuck in the Senate. Senators like Rubio mention the difficulty in passing immigration bills without amendments, leading to failure.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing. I'll start by stating the introduction of the bill and the challenges in the Senate. Then, mention the shift in Republican support over time, the internal conflicts, and the political risks involved. Finally, note the comprehensive nature of the bill and its slim chances in the Senate.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduction of the bill by House Democrats.
2. Senate Republicans' struggle and past support.
3. Shift in GOP stance from compassion to amnesty concerns.
4. Current Senate dynamics and polarization.
5. The bill's comprehensive nature and slim chances.
6. Moral dilemma: personal beliefs vs. political risks.

I need to make sure each point is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, use the moral framing as presented, focusing on the internal conflicts and the balance between compassion and political strategy.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, but its passage faces steep odds in the Senate due to Republican opposition. Once widely supported by Senate Republicans under the DREAM Act, the bill has seen declining GOP backing as the party's conservative wing increasingly viewed it as "amnesty." Over the years, Republican co-sponsorship dropped from 12 in 2003 to none by 2011. Today, many Senate Republicans, influenced by polarization and concerns over being labeled as supporting amnesty, are hesitant to support the bill. Sen. Roy Blunt and others acknowledge the moral case for protecting Dreamers but express doubts about the bill's chances. Meanwhile, the House bill, which also extends protections to those with Temporary Protected Status, is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led Senate. The political calculus for Republicans involves balancing personal compassion for Dreamers with fears of backlash from their conservative base, highlighting a deep moral and political divide. END OF SUMMARY.
