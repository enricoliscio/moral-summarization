SUMMARY:
House Democrats have introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to come up with a solution that they and their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing the DREAM Act as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion". Even Republicans who personally believe Dreamers are entitled to citizenship are hesitant to support the bill due to political concerns. The internal battle has intensified, leaving senators seeing little payoff to support the DREAM Act and all kinds of risks. The bill stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate, where many members are more concerned with border security and wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. END OF SUMMARY.
