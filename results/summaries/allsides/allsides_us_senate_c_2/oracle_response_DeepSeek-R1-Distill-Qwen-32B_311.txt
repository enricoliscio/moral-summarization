Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The article talks about the history of the DREAM Act, how support from Republicans has dwindled over time, and the current political climate making it difficult for the bill to pass.

I need to identify the key moral terms: unfair, end, protected, intensified, exchange, allowed, ravaged, war, disasters, blocked, killed, beating, embrace, protect, becomes, use, fall. I should incorporate these into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by mentioning the bill's introduction and its fate in the Senate. Then, I'll touch on the history of the DREAM Act, highlighting how Republican support decreased. I'll include the terms 'unfair' and 'protected' here. Next, I'll discuss the shift in the Republican party's stance, using words like 'intensified' and 'exchange' for border security. 

I'll also mention the impact on Dreamers, using 'ravaged' and 'disasters' when talking about the TPS program. The opposition from Rubio and others, using 'killed' and 'blocked', will show the challenges. Finally, I'll note the difficulty in passing the bill due to political amendments, using 'fall apart' and 'use' as moral terms.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including as many of the specified words as possible. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to Dreamers, but its fate hinges on Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed the DREAM Act due to its framing as "amnesty." Once widely supported, the bill's Republican co-sponsors dwindled from 12 in 2003 to none by 2011, reflecting a shift in the party's stance. The 2017 end of DACA left Dreamers in legal limbo, prompting the current push. Senate Republicans now view the issue as politically risky, with some, like Sen. Roy Blunt, expressing support for Dreamers but avoiding commitment to the bill. Many Republicans demand an exchange for border security or immigration system changes. Sen. Lindsey Graham called for a "more comprehensive solution," while Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed the standalone bill, citing the risk of amendments that could "fall apart" the legislation. The bill, known as the Dream and Promise Act, would create a citizenship pathway for Dreamers and TPS recipients, but its prospects in the Senate remain dire. END OF SUMMARY.
