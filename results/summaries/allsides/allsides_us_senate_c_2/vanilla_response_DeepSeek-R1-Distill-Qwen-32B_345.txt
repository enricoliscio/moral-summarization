Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a bill introduced by House Democrats to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. The fate of this bill lies with Senate Republicans, who have been struggling to agree on a solution acceptable to their conservative base.

The article mentions the history of the DREAM Act, how it had bipartisan support in the past but has lost support among Republicans as the party became more conservative. It also talks about the DACA program, which was ended by Trump but blocked by courts, leaving Dreamers in limbo. The House bill, the Dream and Promise Act, would offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). However, its chances in the Senate are slim because Republicans want a more comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security measures.

Key points to include in the summary:
- House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act.
- Senate Republicans are unlikely to support it due to internal divisions and demands for broader immigration changes.
- The bill includes protections for both Dreamers and TPS recipients.
- The Senate's stance has shifted from supporting the DREAM Act to requiring more substantial changes, making passage difficult.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures these points clearly. I should avoid going into too much detail about each senator's stance unless it's crucial to the summary. Focus on the main legislative actions and the reasons for the Senate's reluctance.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children (Dreamers) and those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate, where support for such measures has waned due to internal party divisions and a shift toward stricter immigration policies. Senate Republicans have increasingly opposed standalone immigration bills, favoring comprehensive reforms that include border security measures. The bill's prospects are dire, as many senators view it as politically risky and prefer broader immigration overhauls. END OF SUMMARY.
