SUMMARY:
The DREAM Act, which would grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with Republicans struggling to find a solution that satisfies their conservative base. Once supported by a wide range of GOP senators as an act of *compassion*, it has increasingly been viewed as an act of *amnesty*, causing Republicans to back away. The internal *agonized* within the GOP over *compassion* versus *amnesty* has been exacerbated by increasing *polarization*, leaving senators with little *payoff* and facing *risks* if they support the bill. According to Sen. Lugar, members are not prepared to *bleed* and *die* on this issue. The stand-alone bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, with most Republicans endorsing it only in exchange for border security or changes to the legal immigration system. The shift in the Republican stance on the DREAM Act reflects the changing dynamics within the party, with senators like Rubio moving towards a more *hard-line* stance. The House bill, co-sponsored by Democrats, aims to create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS holders but faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led Senate. The challenge of finding a *comprehensive* solution to the immigration *quagmire* underscores the difficulty in making *progress* on this issue. The article highlights the moral and political dilemmas faced by senators and the challenge of securing a *clean* vote on immigration.
