Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The article talks about how the DREAM Act has been supported by some Republicans in the past but has faced opposition as the party became more conservative, viewing it as amnesty. The bill's prospects in the Senate are dire because of internal conflicts and the desire for a more comprehensive immigration solution, which includes border security. The summary needs to capture the moral dilemma and the political challenges.

I should start by mentioning the introduction of the bill by House Democrats. Then, explain the Senate Republicans' stance and the shift in their party's views over time. Highlight the moral arguments about compassion versus concerns over amnesty. Also, include the current challenges like the need for a comprehensive approach and the political risks for senators. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to provide permanent protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, but its fate lies with Senate Republicans, who have increasingly opposed such measures due to internal polarization. Once supported by many Republicans as a compassionate policy, the DREAM Act has been viewed more recently as "amnesty," leading to declining GOP support over the years. Senate Republicans now prioritize a comprehensive immigration solution, often tied to border security, over standalone Dreamer protections. Despite some senators expressing personal support for Dreamers, political risks and party divisions make the bill's passage unlikely. The moral dilemma between compassion for Dreamers and concerns over amnesty remains unresolved, reflecting broader Republican Party shifts and the complexities of immigration reform. END OF SUMMARY.
