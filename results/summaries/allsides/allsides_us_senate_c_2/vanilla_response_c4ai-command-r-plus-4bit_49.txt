SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. While the bill is likely to pass in the Democratic-controlled House, its prospects in the Republican-led Senate are uncertain due to the shift in the Republican Party's stance on immigration. Previously, many Senate Republicans supported the DREAM Act, but the party has gradually moved towards a more conservative position, with some viewing the act as "amnesty." This shift has made it difficult for Republicans to support a stand-alone bill to protect Dreamers, with many instead advocating for border security or changes to the legal immigration system in exchange for Dreamer protections. The article highlights the challenges of passing immigration legislation in a polarized political environment and the internal struggles within the Republican Party. Sen. Marco Rubio, who previously supported comprehensive immigration reform, now believes that a stand-alone Dreamer bill has no chance in the Senate due to the likelihood of amendments that could derail the bill.
