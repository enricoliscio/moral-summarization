SUMMARY:

House Democrats introduced a bill to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. However, the fate of these Dreamers rests in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have struggled to find a solution that their conservative base can endorse. The GOP has backed away from the idea, viewing the DREAM Act as an act of "amnesty" rather than "compassion." The party's more conservative wing has intensified its opposition, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. Even Republicans who personally believe Dreamers are entitled to citizenship are hesitant to support the bill due to political concerns. The White House and most Republicans are only willing to endorse a Dreamer fix in exchange for billions of dollars in border security or wholesale changes to the legal immigration system. The bill stands little chance in the Republican-led Senate, where few are willing to "bleed and die" for the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
