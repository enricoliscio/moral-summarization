Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to keep the moral framing the author used. The article is about House Democrats introducing a bill to protect Dreamers, but the Senate Republicans are unlikely to pass it. The author used words like "punish," "protected," "entitled," "die," "protect," "ravaged," "killed," "bring," "amended," "amendments," "use," and "amend." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, the article starts by explaining that House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act to grant permanent protections to undocumented immigrants brought here as children, known as Dreamers. The fate is in the hands of Senate Republicans, who have been struggling to support such measures. The DREAM Act used to have bipartisan support but has lost backing as the GOP became more conservative, viewing it as amnesty.

The bill's prospects in the Senate look dire because many Republicans fear political backlash. Some senators, like Roy Blunt, are pro-Dreamers but won't commit to voting for the bill. Others, like Lindsey Graham, want a more comprehensive solution, possibly tied to border security. Marco Rubio, once part of a bipartisan group, now opposes standalone bills, fearing amendments that could derail the legislation.

I need to structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, using the specified words. I should mention the protection, the entitled status of Dreamers, the amendments, and the political struggles. Also, note how the bill might be amended or used to push other issues, leading to its potential failure.

I'll start by introducing the bill and its moral framing, then discuss the Senate's stance, the shift in Republican support, and the challenges in passing the bill due to amendments and political risks. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words where appropriate.

SUMMARY: House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act to grant permanent protections to Dreamers, but Senate Republicans face a moral dilemma, struggling to support the bill due to concerns over "amnesty." Once viewed as an act of "compassion," the DREAM Act has lost GOP backing as the party shifted toward a harder line on immigration. Senators like Roy Blunt and Lindsey Graham acknowledge the need to "protect" Dreamers but hesitate to commit to the bill, fearing political risks. The bill's fate is uncertain in the Senate, where amendments could derail it, as seen with Marco Rubio's opposition to standalone measures. The moral framing of "entitlement" to citizenship clashes with political pragmatism, leaving Dreamers in legal limbo. END OF SUMMARY.
