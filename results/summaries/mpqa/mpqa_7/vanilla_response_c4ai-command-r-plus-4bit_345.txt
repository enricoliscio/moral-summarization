SUMMARY: The popularity of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has seen a significant decline, according to recent polls by Alfredo Keller and other leading polling firms. The studies reveal that over half of those polled believe Chavez needs to be removed from office, with a preference for institutional means over force. The approval rating for Chavez has dropped significantly since April 1999, and the myth of polarization between rich and poor that benefited him initially has collapsed. The majority of respondents support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite a shrinking voter preference for Chavez, a divided opposition still keeps him in first place. The strengths attributed to Chavez are more characteristic of a campaigning candidate than a president in office. The polls also indicate that Venezuelans are feeling pessimistic and perceive Chavez as responsible for the country's problems. Luis Christiansen, a polling firm director, identifies unresolved major issues, a drop in popularity, the perception of incapability, and the emergence of substitute leaders as factors contributing to the decline of any government, which Chavez's administration is currently facing.
