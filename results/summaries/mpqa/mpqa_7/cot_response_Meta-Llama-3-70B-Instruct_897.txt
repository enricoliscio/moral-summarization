SUMMARY:
A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study shows a significant drop in Chavez's popularity, with 58% disapproving of his performance and only 33% approving. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of those polled believing many poor oppose him. The majority, 75%, support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Chavez's lead in voter preference has shrunk, and his strengths, such as his personal qualities and desire to work, are no longer enough to keep hope. The number of extreme Chavez opponents has increased, which could lead to a confrontation for power. END OF SUMMARY.
