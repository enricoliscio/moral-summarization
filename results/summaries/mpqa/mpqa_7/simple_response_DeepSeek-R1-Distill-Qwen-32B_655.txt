Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article talks about a study by Alfredo Keller showing a decline in Chavez's approval ratings. It mentions that over half the people surveyed want him removed, with some preferring institutional means and a small percentage supporting force. This indicates a loss of support but also a preference for democratic processes.

Next, the article notes the collapse of the rich-poor polarization myth. Only 20% think the rich oppose Chavez, but 78% of the poor do. This shows that his base isn't as solid as before, which is a moral point about his leadership and policies.

There's also a strong support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% agreeing. This suggests a desire for change and a more balanced government, which is a positive moral stance towards governance.

The article mentions that despite the drop in support, Chavez still leads in voter preference but his edge is shrinking. This reflects the impact of unresolved issues like the economy, insecurity, and unemployment, which are major concerns for the people.

Polling firms like Datanalisis and Consultores 21 highlight Chavez's weaknesses: unresolved problems, declining popularity, and the perception of him as an ineffective leader. The fact that more people oppose him than support him could lead to political confrontation, which is a negative moral implication.

I need to make sure the summary captures the decline in approval, the reasons behind it, the shift in public opinion towards a referendum, and the underlying issues affecting Chavez's leadership. Also, I should include the moral framing, such as the loss of support, the perception of ineffective governance, and the potential for conflict.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main findings, then delve into the specifics like the polarization collapse, referendum support, and the underlying issues. I'll end with the implications, like the possibility of confrontation, to highlight the moral aspects.

Let me check the word count. The original response was 198 words, so I need to stay within 200. I'll make sure each point is concise and flows logically.

I think I've covered all the key points. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary that preserves the moral framing.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, reflecting growing public dissatisfaction. Over half of those surveyed believe Chavez should be removed from office, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting forceful methods. This contrasts with 43% who prefer allowing him to complete his term. Chavez's approval rating dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. The study also challenges the notion of polarization between rich and poor, as only 20% believe the wealthy oppose Chavez, while 78% of the poor do. A strong majority (75%) supports a constitutional referendum to restore power balance. Despite declining support, Chavez remains the top choice among voters, though his lead has shrunk due to unresolved issues like economic crisis, insecurity, and unemployment. Polling firms highlight Chavez's weakening popularity, perceptions of ineffectiveness, and the rise of extreme opposition, potentially leading to political confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
