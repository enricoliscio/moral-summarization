SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller confirms the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of the polled adults believing it's necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study reveals a significant drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating plummeting to 33%. The results also show a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing many poor people oppose Chavez.

The study highlights the country's unresolved major problems, including insecurity and unemployment, which are blamed on Chavez's incapacity. Venezuelans are feeling pessimistic, with 80% believing there is a solution to the unemployment problem. The President's ability to keep hope is shrinking, with 43% finding nothing positive in the government's actions.

A clear majority, 75%, favor a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite Chavez's lead in voter preference, the effects of a divided opposition keep him in first place. The study paints a dire picture of a country in crisis, with Chavez's popularity in decline.

END OF SUMMARY.
