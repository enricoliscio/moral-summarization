SUMMARY: Recent polls reveal a significant drop in Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's popularity and approval ratings. The study, conducted by Alfredo Keller, found that over half of those polled believed Chavez needed to be removed from office, with a slight preference for institutional means over forceful removal. The approval rating has dropped drastically since 1999, with a recent disapproval rating of 58%. The polls also indicate a shift away from the perception of polarization between rich and poor, with a majority believing that many poor people also oppose Chavez. A referendum to redraft the Constitution is favored by a large majority. Despite the decline in popularity, Chavez remains the frontrunner in voter preference due to a divided opposition. However, the gap is narrowing, with Henrique Salas Romer and other candidates gaining support. The analysis highlights key factors contributing to Chavez's decline, including unresolved issues, a drop in popularity, and a perception of incapability. The number of extreme Chavez opponents now outnumbers his extreme supporters, pointing towards a potential power struggle.

END OF SUMMARY.
