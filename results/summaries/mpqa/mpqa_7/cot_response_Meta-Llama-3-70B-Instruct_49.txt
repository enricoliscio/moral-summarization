SUMMARY:
A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study shows a significant drop in Chavez's popularity, with 58% disapproving of his governance and only 33% approving. The results also indicate a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing there are many poor who oppose him. The population's disapproval of the government's job reaches 93% and 88.4% on the insecurity and unemployment problems, respectively. Venezuelans are feeling pessimistic, and 80% believe there is a solution for the unemployment problem, blaming Chavez's incapacity for the issue. The study suggests that Chavez is facing a decline in popularity and a loss of strength in keeping hope. END OF SUMMARY.
