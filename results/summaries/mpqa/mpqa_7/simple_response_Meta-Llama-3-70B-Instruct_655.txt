SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with over half of those polled believing he should be removed from office to solve the crisis. The study also revealed a drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating falling to 33%. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of those polled believing many poor people oppose Chavez. The study also showed strong support for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75% in favor. Despite Chavez's declining popularity, he still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. The study suggests that Venezuelans are losing hope in Chavez's ability to solve the country's problems, with 80% believing unemployment can be solved and 42% considering themselves extreme opponents of Chavez.

END OF SUMMARY.
