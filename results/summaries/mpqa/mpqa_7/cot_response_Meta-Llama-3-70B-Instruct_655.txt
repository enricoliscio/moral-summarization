SUMMARY:
A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study reveals a significant shift in public opinion, with 58% disapproving of Chavez's government and only 33% approving. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of those polled believing many poor people oppose Chavez. The majority, 75%, support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Chavez's lead in voter preference continues to shrink, with 42% of extreme opponents and 18% of extreme supporters, potentially leading to a confrontation for power. END OF SUMMARY.
