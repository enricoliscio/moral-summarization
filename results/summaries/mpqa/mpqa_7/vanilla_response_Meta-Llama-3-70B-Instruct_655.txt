SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. The study, conducted among 1,000 adults from different socioeconomic groups, found that more than half of those polled believe it is necessary to remove Chavez from office to solve the crisis. Only 43% prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. The study also showed a drop in Chavez's approval rating, from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November. Additionally, 75% of those polled agree with calling a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite his declining popularity, Chavez still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. The effects of a divided opposition keep him in first place.

END OF SUMMARY.
