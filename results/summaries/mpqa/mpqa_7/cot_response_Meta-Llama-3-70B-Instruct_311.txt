SUMMARY:
A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study also shows a drop in the President's popularity, with 58% disapproving of his performance and only 33% approving. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of those polled believing many poor people oppose him. A clear majority of 75% support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite his lead in voter preference, Chavez is facing a decline in popularity, with 57.4% feeling bad or worse than in the past and 55.3% citing economic problems as their main concern. Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic, blaming the President for the country's problems, including unemployment and insecurity. END OF SUMMARY.
