SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller has revealed a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with over half of those polled believing that he should be removed from office to address the nation's crisis. The study also indicates a shift away from the rich-poor polarization narrative, as 78% believe there are many poor who oppose Chavez. There is strong support for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75% in favor. Despite a shrinking lead, Chavez remains the frontrunner among possible presidential candidates due to a divided opposition. However, the Consultores 21 polling firm highlights that Chavez faces significant problems, including unresolved issues, a drop in popularity, and a perception of incapability. The firm also notes that Venezuelans' optimism has waned since 1998, and they now blame Chavez for problems like unemployment. The study suggests a growing number of extreme Chavez opponents, which could lead to a power struggle. 

END OF SUMMARY.
