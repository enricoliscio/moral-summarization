SUMMARY:
The popularity of President Hugo Chavez has taken a significant hit, according to recent polls. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office to resolve the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. The approval rating for Chavez has dropped drastically since the start of his administration, with a current disapproval rating of 58 percent. This shift in public opinion also debunks the notion of polarization between the rich and poor, as an overwhelming majority of 78 percent believe that many poor citizens are opposed to Chavez. 

The study reveals a strong preference for a referendum to re-draft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75 percent in favor. Despite the shrinking support base, Chavez remains in first place due to a divided opposition, highlighting the unwavering commitment of his radical supporters. 

Furthermore, the analysis highlights four key ingredients for the decline of any government, three of which are evident in Chavez's administration: unresolved issues, a drop in popularity, and a perception of incapability. The study also points to a shift in Venezuelans' optimism, with a return to the pessimistic sentiments of 1998, indicating a loss of hope in Chavez's leadership. 

The poll results demonstrate a clear erosion of support for Chavez, with a growing number of extreme opponents and a decline in his approval rating. This suggests a potential power struggle on the horizon.
