SUMMARY: Recent polls indicate a sharp decline in the popularity of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The approval rating for Chavez has dropped significantly since the beginning of his administration, with more than half of those polled believing that he should be removed from office. The polls also reflect a shift away from the perception of polarization between rich and poor, as the majority of respondents believe that there are many poor who oppose Chavez. Additionally, a clear majority favors a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite the decline in support for Chavez, he still leads in voter preference due to a divided opposition. However, the number of extreme Chavez opponents is growing, which could lead to a power struggle. The study highlights a growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership and a desire for change among Venezuelans.

END OF SUMMARY.
