Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Hugo Chavez's declining approval ratings. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Alfredo Keller's study shows a drop in Chavez's approval rating, from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November. More than half of those surveyed want him removed, with some preferring a referendum. There's also a shift in public perception from polarization between rich and poor to more poor people opposing him. Additionally, other polls indicate Venezuelans are pessimistic about the economy, security, and unemployment, with Chavez's popularity declining.

I need to highlight the moral implications here. The decline in approval suggests a loss of trust in Chavez's leadership. The shift in opposition from the wealthy to the poor might indicate that Chavez's policies aren't meeting expectations, which is a moral failing in governance. The mention of possible removal through referendum or force shows a loss of faith in his ability to lead effectively.

I should structure the summary to reflect these points clearly, emphasizing the moral aspects like loss of trust, failure to address key issues, and the potential for political instability. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's after the "SUMMARY:" token and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it captures the main findings and the underlying moral critique of Chavez's administration.

SUMMARY: Recent studies, including Alfredo Keller's poll, reveal a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, dropping from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November. Over half of those surveyed believe Chavez should be removed from office, with 49% favoring a referendum and 5% supporting forceful means. The once-polarized divide between the rich and poor has shifted, with 78% of respondents acknowledging that many poor people oppose Chavez. His disapproval rating has risen to 58%, reflecting growing public dissatisfaction. Polls also indicate Venezuelans are pessimistic about the economy, unemployment, and insecurity, with 43% finding nothing positive in the government's actions. Chavez's strengths, such as personal qualities and work ethic, are seen as more suited to a campaigning candidate than a seasoned president. Despite his 28% lead in voter preference, the rise of extreme opponents (42%) over supporters (18%) suggests potential political instability. END OF SUMMARY.
