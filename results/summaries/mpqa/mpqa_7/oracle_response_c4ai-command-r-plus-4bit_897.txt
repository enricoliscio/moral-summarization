SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller has revealed a significant drop in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with over half of those polled believing he should be removed from office to resolve the nation's crisis. The study shows a shift from the initial perception of polarization between rich and poor, as now 78% believe there are many poor who oppose Chavez. Additionally, 75% support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite a shrinking lead, Chavez remains the frontrunner in voter preference due to a divided opposition. However, the study highlights growing dissatisfaction with his handling of unresolved problems like insecurity and unemployment. The analysis by Consultores 21's Luis Christiansen identifies four key ingredients for the decline of any government, including Chavez's leadership. Venezuelans are pessimistic about the future, and a majority blame Chavez for the country's issues, perceiving him as incapable of providing solutions. The study underscores a growing sentiment for change and a potential confrontation for power.
END OF SUMMARY.
