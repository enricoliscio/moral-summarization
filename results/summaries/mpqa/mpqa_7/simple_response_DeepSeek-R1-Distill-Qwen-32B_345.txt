Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Hugo Chavez's falling approval ratings in Venezuela. I need to make sure the summary captures the key points without losing the author's perspective on the situation.

First, I should read through the article carefully. It mentions that Alfredo Keller's study shows a significant drop in Chavez's approval rating. More than half of the people polled want him removed, with a majority preferring institutional means over force. The approval rating has dropped from 84% to 33%, while disapproval has risen to 58%. This indicates a shift in public sentiment.

The article also talks about the myth of polarization between rich and poor. Initially, it was thought that the rich were against Chavez, but now more poor people are opposing him. That's an important point because it challenges the initial assumption about his base of support.

There's a strong support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% in favor. This shows a desire for change in the political structure. However, despite the drop in popularity, Chavez still leads in voter preference, albeit with a shrinking margin. The opposition is divided, which keeps him in first place, highlighting the strength of his radical supporters.

Additionally, the article mentions that Venezuelans are feeling pessimistic, similar to 1998, but without the hope that Chavez initially inspired. Unemployment and insecurity are major issues, and a significant portion blames Chavez for these problems. The analysis by Luis Christiansen points out that Chavez's strengths are more campaign-oriented, which doesn't translate well into governance.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main findings: the drop in approval, the desire for removal, and the shift in polarization. Then, mention the referendum support and the reasons behind Chavez's still-leading position despite the drop. Finally, touch on the pessimism and the analysis about Chavez's strengths.

I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll highlight the public's frustration with Chavez's leadership, the blame on him for economic issues, and the potential for confrontation due to the rise in opponents. The summary should reflect the decline in his popularity and the underlying reasons without adding my own bias.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the study's findings, then the shift in polarization, the referendum support, Chavez's standing despite the drop, the economic issues, and the analysis pointing to his weaknesses as a leader. Make sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.

I think that covers all the essential points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article. Now, I'll put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, with disapproval rising to 58%. Over half of those polled believe Chavez should be removed from office, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting force. The myth of polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, as 78% of respondents believe many poor oppose Chavez. A strong 75% support a constitutional referendum to restore power balance. Despite his shrinking edge, Chavez remains first in voter preference, benefiting from a divided opposition and the strength of his radical supporters. Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic, blaming Chavez for economic problems like unemployment and insecurity. Analysts note Chavez's campaign strengths, such as personal qualities, are failing to address governance challenges, with 42% of extreme opponents outnumbering 18% of extreme supporters, signaling potential political confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
