SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant and sustained decline of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. The majority of those polled (54%) believe that removing Chavez from office is necessary to solve the crisis, with 49% supporting institutional channels and 5% advocating for forceful means. The President's approval rating has dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while his disapproval rating has risen to 58%. The study also reveals that the myth of polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of respondents believing that many poor people oppose Chavez. Furthermore, 75% of those polled support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. The poll suggests that Chavez's popularity is dwindling, but he still leads voter preference due to a divided opposition.
