Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Hugo Chavez's declining approval ratings, according to a study by Alfredo Keller. The poll shows that over half of the respondents want him removed from office, either through institutional means or force. His approval rating has dropped significantly from 84% to 33%, while disapproval rose to 58%. There's a shift in public perception regarding the rich and poor, with more poor people opposing him. Support for a constitutional referendum is high at 75%.

The article also mentions that despite his lead, Chavez's support is shrinking, and the opposition is divided. Other candidates like Henrique Salas Romer and Alfredo Pena are gaining support. Another poll by Datanalisis shows Venezuelans are pessimistic, with high disapproval on issues like insecurity and unemployment. Chavez's popularity is declining, and he's seen as incapable by many, leading to a potential confrontation.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like crisis, problems, insecurity, unemployment, decline, unresolved, incapable, solution, responsible, shrinking. I should structure the summary to reflect the negative trend in Chavez's approval and the underlying issues like economic problems and social divisions.

I'll start by mentioning the study's findings on approval ratings, then move to the reasons behind the decline, such as unresolved problems and Chavez's perceived incapacity. I'll also touch on the support for a referendum and the potential for confrontation. I'll keep each point concise to stay within 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral framing words. I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, dropping from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. Over half of those polled believe Chavez should be removed from office to address the crisis, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting forceful methods. The study also shows a collapse of the polarization myth, as 78% of respondents believe many poor oppose Chavez, compared to 20% who think the rich are against him. Support for a constitutional referendum to restore power balance is high at 75%. Despite his shrinking lead, Chavez remains in first place, but his popularity is waning due to unresolved problems like unemployment and insecurity. Venezuelans are pessimistic, with 93% disapproving of the government's handling of insecurity and 88.4% on unemployment. Chavez is seen as incapable by many, with 42% being extreme opponents compared to 18% extreme supporters. His ability to inspire hope is shrinking, and his leadership is increasingly questioned. END OF SUMMARY.
