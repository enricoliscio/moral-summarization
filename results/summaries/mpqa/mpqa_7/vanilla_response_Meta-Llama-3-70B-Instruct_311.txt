SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. The study, conducted among 1,000 adults from different socioeconomic groups in various cities, found that more than half of the respondents believe it is necessary to remove Chavez from office to solve the crisis. Only 43% prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. The President's approval rating has dropped from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November, while his disapproval rating has increased to 58%. The study also found that 75% of respondents support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite his declining popularity, Chavez still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. Other presidential candidates, such as Henrique Salas Romer and Julio Borges, are gaining ground.
