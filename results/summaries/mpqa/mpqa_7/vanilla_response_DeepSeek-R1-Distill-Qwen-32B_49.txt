Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions a study by Alfredo Keller showing a significant drop in Chavez's approval rating. Initially, his approval was 84% in April 1999, but by November, it dropped to 33%, with disapproval at 58%. That's a big change. More than half of those surveyed think Chavez should be removed from office, with 49% wanting it through institutional means and 5% through force. However, 43% prefer he stays until 2007.

The myth of polarization between rich and poor is collapsing. Only 20% think the rich oppose him, but 78% believe many poor do. There's strong support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% agreeing. Despite this, Chavez is still leading in voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. Other candidates like Henrique Salas Romer and Alfredo Pena are gaining support.

Another poll by Datanalisis shows 57.4% feel worse off, with economic issues as the main concern. Disapproval on insecurity and unemployment is high. If elections were held, Chavez would still win but with a reduced lead. Alfredo Pena's support has increased.

Luis Christiansen from Consultores 21 points out two key factors in government decline: unresolved problems and drop in popularity. Venezuelans are pessimistic, similar to 1998, but without the hope Chavez once brought. Many blame Chavez for unemployment, and his strengths are more campaigning than presidential. Extreme opponents outnumber supporters, risking confrontation, but he still leads with 28% preference.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: drop in approval, reasons for it, polarization myth, referendum support, election preferences, and the analysis on government decline factors. I should keep it under 200 words, concise, and include the key statistics and findings.
