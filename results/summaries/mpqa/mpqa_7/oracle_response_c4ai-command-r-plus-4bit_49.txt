SUMMARY: Venezuela is facing a crisis of confidence in President Hugo Chavez, with a recent poll showing a significant drop in his approval rating and an increase in the number of people who believe he is incapable of solving the country's problems. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office, with a majority favoring institutional means over forceful removal. The President's approval rating has dropped from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November, with a similar rise in his disapproval rating. This shift reflects a collapse in the belief that Chavez's support is primarily among the poor, as 78% now believe there are many poor who oppose him.

The study also revealed a strong desire for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore a balance of power, with 75% in favor. Despite a shrinking voter preference for Chavez, a divided opposition keeps him in first place. However, the number of extreme Chavez opponents is growing, which could lead to a confrontation for power. The poll highlighted Venezuelans' pessimism about the country's future, with 80% believing there is a solution to the unemployment problem but blaming Chavez for his incapacity to address it. The government's actions are seen as lacking any positive impact, with the President's personal qualities and work ethic being his only strengths. Overall, the poll indicates a decline in support for Chavez and a perception of unresolved problems, insecurity, and unemployment.
