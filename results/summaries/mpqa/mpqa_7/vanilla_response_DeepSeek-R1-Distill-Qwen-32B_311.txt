Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions a study by Alfredo Keller showing a decline in Chavez's popularity. The sample size is 1,000 adults across various cities. Over half think he should be removed, with some preferring institutional means and a small group considering force. His approval rating dropped from 84% to 33%, while disapproval rose to 58%. This shows a shift from the initial polarization between rich and poor; now, more poor people oppose him.

The article also talks about support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% in favor. Despite the shrinking lead, Chavez remains first in voter preference, partly due to a divided opposition. Other candidates like Henrique Salas Romero and Alfredo Pena are gaining support.

Additional polls from Datanalisis and Consultores 21 add more context. Venezuelans are pessimistic, with high disapproval on issues like insecurity and unemployment. Chavez's support has dropped from 40% to 24%, while Alfredo Pena's support has increased. Luis Christiansen points out key factors in the decline: unresolved problems, lower popularity, perception of incapacity, and the presence of alternative leaders.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the study's findings on approval ratings and the shift in public opinion. Then, touch on the referendum support and Chavez's standing despite opposition divisions. Finally, include the additional poll results and the factors contributing to his decline.

I should ensure the summary is concise, covering all key points without going into too much detail. Make sure to mention the main percentages and the implications for Chavez's leadership.
