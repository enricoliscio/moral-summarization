SUMMARY:
The approval rating of President Hugo Chavez has experienced a significant and sustained decline, according to the latest polls and a study by Alfredo Keller. The study, conducted among a diverse sample of 1,000 adults across several Venezuelan cities, reveals that over half of those polled believe Chavez's removal from office is necessary to resolve the country's crisis. Among this group, most favor institutional means, while a small minority support forceful methods. Chavez's approval rating has dropped sharply since April 1999, with disapproval now surpassing approval. The myth of polarization between rich and poor, once a cornerstone of Chavez's support, has also collapsed, as an overwhelming majority of respondents believe there are many poor who oppose him. 

The study highlights a strong preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75 percent in favor. Despite the erosion of support for Chavez, a divided opposition keeps him in the lead among potential presidential candidates. His strengths lie in his personal qualities and work ethic, indicative of a campaigning candidate rather than an incumbent. However, Chavez is facing significant challenges, including Venezuelans' pessimism and a perception of his incapability to address key issues like unemployment. 

The analysis also points to a shift in the balance of power, with extreme opponents of Chavez now outnumbering his extreme supporters, potentially leading to a power struggle. Nonetheless, Chavez remains the preferred choice among voters, highlighting the enduring support of his radical base.
