SUMMARY: The approval rating of President Hugo Chavez has plummeted, with more than half of those polled believing he needs to be removed from office. This indicates a shift away from the initial perception of polarization between rich and poor, as now, a significant majority of those polled believe there are many poor who oppose Chavez. Furthermore, the study shows a strong preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite Chavez still leading in voter preference, his lead has significantly diminished due to a divided opposition. The analysis highlights four key ingredients for the decline of a government, three of which are evident in Chavez's administration: unresolved major problems, a drop in popularity, and the perception of an incapable leader. The study also reveals that Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic and hold Chavez responsible for the country's issues. The analyst warns of a potential confrontation for power as the number of extreme Chavez opponents surpasses that of extreme supporters. This article underscores the Venezuelan people's growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership and their desire for change.
END OF SUMMARY.
