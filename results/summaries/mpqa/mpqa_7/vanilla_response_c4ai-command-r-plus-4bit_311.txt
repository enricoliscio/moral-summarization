SUMMARY: The latest polls show a significant drop in the approval rating of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, with more than half of those polled believing that he should be removed from office. The study, conducted by Alfredo Keller, found that 54% of respondents favored removing Chavez, while 43% preferred to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. Additionally, the poll indicated a collapse in the belief that Chavez's support was primarily from the poor, with 78% believing that many poor people also opposed him. The study also revealed a strong preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75% in agreement. Despite the decline in popularity, Chavez still leads in voter preference for a potential election, although his lead has shrunk. The poll also highlighted the increasing number of extreme Chavez opponents, which could lead to a power struggle.
