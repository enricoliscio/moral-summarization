SUMMARY:
The popularity of President Hugo Chavez is experiencing a resounding and sustained decline, as revealed by the latest polls and a study by Alfredo Keller. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office, with a majority favoring institutional channels over forceful means. The President's approval rating has dropped significantly since April 1999, and the myth of polarization between rich and poor that initially supported him has collapsed. The study also shows a strong preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite the shrinking of Chavez's voter preference due to a divided opposition, he still leads in polls. However, the number of extreme Chavez opponents is now larger than that of extreme supporters, indicating a potential confrontation for power. According to Luis Christiansen of Consultores 21, Chavez is facing key ingredients for governmental decline, including unresolved problems, a drop in popularity, and a perception of incapability. Venezuelans' optimism has faded, and they now blame Chavez for problems like unemployment. The study highlights a shift in power dynamics and a loss of hope in Chavez's leadership.
