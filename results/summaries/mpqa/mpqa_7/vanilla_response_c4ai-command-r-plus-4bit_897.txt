SUMMARY: Recent polls show a significant decline in the popularity of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, with more than half of those polled believing he should be removed from office. The study, conducted by Alfredo Keller, found that 54% of respondents favored removing Chavez, while 43% preferred to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. Additionally, the poll revealed a collapse in the belief that Chavez's support was primarily from the poor, with 78% believing there were many poor who opposed him. The study also showed strong support for a referendum to redraft the Constitution, with 75% in favor. Despite the decline in popularity, Chavez still leads in voter preference due to a divided opposition. However, his lead has shrunk, and the number of extreme opponents has grown, which could lead to a power struggle. The poll highlights a growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership and a potential shift in Venezuela's political landscape.
