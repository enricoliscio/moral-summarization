SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller confirms the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing he should be removed from office to solve the crisis. The study also shows a drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating at 33%. The results indicate a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing many poor people oppose Chavez. A clear majority (75%) support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite Chavez's declining popularity, he still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. The study's findings suggest that Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic about the country's future and blame Chavez for the nation's problems, including unemployment and insecurity.
