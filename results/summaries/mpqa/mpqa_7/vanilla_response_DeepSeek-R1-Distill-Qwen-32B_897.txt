Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article mentions a study by Alfredo Keller showing a drop in Chavez's approval. The sample size is 1,000 adults across various cities. Over 50% think he should be removed, with some preferring institutional means and a few supporting force. Approval rating has dropped from 84% to 33%, while disapproval rose to 58%. The myth of rich vs. poor polarization is fading, with more poor opposing him. 75% support a constitutional referendum. Despite opposition division, Chavez still leads in voter preference but his edge is shrinking. Other candidates are gaining support.

Another report from El Universal adds that four polls show a drop in popularity. Economic issues are a major concern, with 57.4% feeling worse off. Disapproval on insecurity and unemployment is high. Chavez's lead has dropped from 40% to 24%. Alfredo Pena's support has risen. Luis Christiansen points out Chavez is facing key factors leading to government decline: unresolved problems, lower popularity, seen as incapable, and potential substitute leaders. Venezuelans are pessimistic again, similar to 1998. Many blame Chavez for unemployment. His strengths are personal qualities and work ethic, but as a candidate, not an incumbent. He's losing hope, and more oppose him than support, risking confrontation.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: approval drop, reasons, public opinion on removal, referendum support, economic issues, and the factors leading to Chavez's decline. Also mention his lead but shrinking edge. Keep it concise and clear.

Let me structure it: Start with the main findings of the study, mention the drop in approval, public sentiment on removal, the myth collapse, referendum support. Then add the economic issues from the other reports, Chavez's strengths and weaknesses, and the factors leading to his decline. Conclude with his current standing despite opposition.

Make sure to stay within word limit. Avoid jargon, keep it straightforward. Check for any important details I might have missed, like the specific percentages and the names of other candidates. But since the summary needs to be concise, focus on the main trends and statistics.

Okay, time to put it all together in a coherent summary.
