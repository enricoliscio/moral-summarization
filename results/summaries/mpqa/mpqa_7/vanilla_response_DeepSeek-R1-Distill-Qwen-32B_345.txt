Okay, I need to summarize this article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. Let me read through the details. The article mentions a study by Alfredo Keller showing a drop in his popularity. The sample size was 1,000 adults across various cities. More than half want him removed, with 49% preferring institutional means and 5% force. 43% want him to finish his term.

His approval rating dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. The myth of rich vs. poor is fading; only 20% think the rich oppose him, but 78% say many poor do. 75% support a constitutional referendum.

Chavez still leads in voter preference at 25%, but his lead is shrinking. Other candidates like Salas Romer and Borges are gaining. Another poll by Datanalisis shows 57.4% feel worse, 55.3% cite economic issues, and disapproval on insecurity and unemployment is high. If elections were held, he'd still win but with a smaller margin.

Consultores 21's Luis Christiansen points out Chavez is facing two key issues: unresolved problems and declining popularity. Venezuelans are pessimistic, blaming Chavez for unemployment. His strengths are personal qualities and work ethic, but these are more campaigning traits. Extreme opponents outnumber supporters, risking confrontation. He leads voter preference at 28%.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, highlighting the main points: approval drop, reasons, referendum support, opposition, and election predictions.
