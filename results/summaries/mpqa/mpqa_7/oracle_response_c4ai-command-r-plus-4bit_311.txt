SUMMARY: Hugo Chavez is facing a moral crisis of governance, as reflected in the latest polls. His approval rating has dropped significantly since the beginning of his administration, and more than half of those polled believe that he needs to be removed from office to address the nation's pressing problems. The study reveals a perception of Chavez as an incapable leader who is unable to resolve issues such as insecurity and unemployment. The results also indicate a collapse of the rich-poor divide myth, with 78% believing that many poor people oppose him. A clear majority favors a referendum to re-draft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite a shrinking voter preference for Chavez, a divided opposition keeps him in first place. However, the number of extreme Chavez opponents is now larger than that of extreme supporters, pointing towards a potential confrontation for power. The analysis highlights Chavez's declining ability to keep hope and maintain stability in Venezuela.

END OF SUMMARY.
