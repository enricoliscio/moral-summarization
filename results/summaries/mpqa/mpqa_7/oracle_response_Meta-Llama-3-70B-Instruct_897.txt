SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study reveals a significant drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating dropping to 33%. The results also show a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing there are many poor who oppose him.

The study highlights the growing perception of Chavez as an incapable leader, with 43% finding nothing positive in the government's actions. Venezuelans are increasingly blaming Chavez for the country's problems, including unemployment and insecurity, with 80% believing there is a solution to these issues. The president's ability to keep hope is shrinking, and the number of extreme Chavez opponents (42%) now surpasses that of extreme Chavez supporters (18%).

END OF SUMMARY.
