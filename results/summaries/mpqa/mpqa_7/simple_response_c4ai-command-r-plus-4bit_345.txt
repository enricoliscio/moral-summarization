SUMMARY: The latest polls show a resounding and sustained drop in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office to solve the crisis, and a significant majority favor a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. The study reflects the collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with a large proportion of poor Venezuelans now opposing Chavez. While Chavez still leads in voter preference, his lead has shrunk significantly due to a divided opposition. The analysis suggests that Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic about the future and blame Chavez for the country's problems, particularly unemployment. The poll reveals a growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership and a shift towards more extreme opposition to his rule.

END OF SUMMARY.
