SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study reveals a significant drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating plummeting to 33%. The results also show a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing many poor oppose him. Furthermore, 75% of respondents favor a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. The study highlights the unresolved problems of insecurity and unemployment, with 93% and 88.4% of respondents disapproving of the government's handling of these issues, respectively.
