Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Hugo Chavez's declining approval ratings in Venezuela. The study by Alfredo Keller shows that over half the people want him removed, either through institutional means or force. There's a shift in public perception, with more poor people opposing him than before. The article also mentions the opposition's division keeping Chavez in first place, and other candidates gaining support.

I need to highlight the crisis, problems like insecurity and unemployment, the decline in approval, Chavez's perceived incapacity, and the responsibility he's being held accountable for. I should also mention the shrinking support and the potential for a confrontation.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main finding about the approval ratings, then touch on the reasonsâ€”unresolved problems, Chavez's perceived inability to solve them. Then, I'll mention the shift in public opinion regarding the rich and poor, the referendum support, and the opposition's division. Finally, I'll include the details about voter preference and the analyst's points about the government's decline factors.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure to use the morally charged words without making it too lengthy. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll need to be precise. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the main finding, then the reasons, followed by the shift in public opinion, the referendum, the opposition, voter preference, and the analyst's factors. I'll check each sentence to include the necessary moral terms and ensure the summary captures the essence of the article without adding personal opinions.

Okay, I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together in a coherent, concise summary.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, reflecting a growing crisis of confidence among Venezuelans. Over half of those polled believe Chavez should be removed from office to address unresolved problems such as insecurity and unemployment, with 49% favoring institutional channels and 5% supporting forceful means. Chavez's approval rating has dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33%, while his disapproval rating rose to 58%. The study also shows a collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of respondents believing many poor oppose Chavez. A referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore power balance is supported by 75% of those polled. Despite shrinking voter preference, Chavez remains in first place due to a divided opposition. Polls indicate Venezuelans are pessimistic about the government's ability to solve problems, with 43% finding nothing positive in its actions. Chavez's personal qualities and desire to work are seen as strengths, but his ability to inspire hope is shrinking. With 42% of Venezuelans opposing him and only 18% supporting him, the stage is set for potential confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
