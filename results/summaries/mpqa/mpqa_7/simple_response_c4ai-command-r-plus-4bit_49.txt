SUMMARY: Hugo Chavez, the President of Venezuela, has seen a drastic and sustained decline in his approval ratings according to recent polls, revealing a stark shift in public opinion. The study by Alfredo Keller highlights that over half of those polled believe Chavez needs to be removed from office, with a majority favoring institutional means. This signifies a rejection of the notion that Chavez's opposition stems solely from the rich and powerful, as 78% believe there are many poor who oppose him. 

The poll also indicates a desire for a referendum to re-draft the Constitution and restore a balance of power, reflecting a loss of faith in Chavez's leadership. Despite a shrinking voter preference for Chavez, a divided opposition still keeps him in first place, showcasing the resilience of his radical supporters. However, the emergence of a substitute leader cannot be ruled out, as Venezuelans seek solutions to pressing issues like unemployment. 

Chavez's strengths lie in his personal qualities and work ethic, but these are more typical of a campaigning candidate than an incumbent president. With two-thirds of Venezuelans holding Chavez responsible for the country's woes, his ability to inspire hope is diminishing. The analysis underscores the growing number of extreme Chavez opponents, foreshadowing a potential power struggle. 

END OF SUMMARY.
