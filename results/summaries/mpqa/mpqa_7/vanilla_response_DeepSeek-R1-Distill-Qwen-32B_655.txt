Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article mentions a study by Alfredo Keller showing a drop in Chavez's approval. The sample size is 1,000 adults from various cities. Over half think he should be removed, with some preferring institutional means and a few force. Approval went from 84% to 33%, disapproval up to 58%. The myth of rich vs poor is collapsing; more poor oppose him. 75% support a constitutional referendum. Despite this, Chavez is still first in polls but his lead is shrinking. Other candidates are gaining, like Alfredo Pena. Another poll by Datanalisis shows people are worse off, economic issues top concerns, disapproval on security and unemployment. Chavez's lead dropped from 40% to 24%. Another analyst says Chavez faces two key factors: unresolved problems and falling popularity. Venezuelans are pessimistic, more blame him for unemployment. His strengths are personal qualities, but he's losing hope. Opponents outnumber supporters, risking confrontation. Chavez still leads with 28%.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main findings: Keller's study showing approval drop, more than half want him removed, breakdown of methods. Mention the approval ratings trend, myth collapse. Then the referendum support, Chavez's shrinking lead, other candidates. Include the Datanalisis poll on worsening conditions and disapproval. Mention the analyst's points about Chavez's challenges, Venezuelans' pessimism, blame on unemployment, strengths, and the confrontation risk. Conclude with his current lead.

I should make sure it's concise, covers all key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it logically, starting with the study, then the implications, other polls, and the analyst's analysis. Keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with over half of respondents believing he should be removed from office to address the crisis. While 49% prefer institutional channels for his replacement, 5% support forceful means. Approval ratings have dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. The study also challenges the notion of polarization between rich and poor, as 78% of respondents believe many poor oppose Chavez. A majority (75%) support a constitutional referendum to restore power balance. Despite his shrinking lead, Chavez remains first in voter preference, though his edge has dropped from 40% to 24%. Other candidates, like Alfredo Pena, have gained support. Analysts note Venezuelans' pessimism, with 80% believing unemployment can be solved, and 40% blaming Chavez. His strengths, such as personal qualities, are seen as campaign traits rather than presidential achievements. Extreme opponents now outnumber supporters, risking confrontation. Chavez still leads with 28% voter preference. END OF SUMMARY.
