SUMMARY:
The popularity of President Hugo Chavez is experiencing a resounding and sustained decline, according to recent polls and studies. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez should be removed from office, with a majority favoring institutional means over forceful ones. The approval rating for Chavez has dropped significantly since April 1999, with disapproval now surpassing approval. The myth of polarization between rich and poor that characterized the beginning of his administration has also collapsed, as an overwhelming majority believes there are many poor who oppose him. 

The study reveals a strong preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power, with 75 percent in favor. Despite the shrinking support base, Chavez remains in first place due to a divided opposition, showcasing the resilience of his radical supporters. However, the analysis highlights the emergence of a larger group of extreme Chavez opponents, which could lead to a power confrontation. 

The decline in Chavez's popularity is attributed to unresolved major problems, a drop in personal approval, and a perception of incapability as a leader. Venezuelans are pessimistic about the future, and a significant proportion blames Chavez for the country's issues, particularly unemployment. The strengths of Chavez lie in his personal qualities and work ethic, reminiscent of a campaigning candidate rather than an incumbent president.
