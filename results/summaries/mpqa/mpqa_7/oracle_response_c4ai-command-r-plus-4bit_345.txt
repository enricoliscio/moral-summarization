SUMMARY: Venezuela is facing a crisis of confidence in President Hugo Chavez, with his approval ratings plummeting to new lows. The study reveals a growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership, highlighting a range of moral issues such as insecurity, unemployment, and the perception of his incapability to govern effectively. More than half of Venezuelans believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office to address these pressing problems. While a portion of this group advocates for forceful removal, the majority favors institutional channels. The polls also indicate a shift away from the rich-poor divide that characterized Chavez's initial support base, with an overwhelming majority believing that many poor citizens now oppose him. Additionally, there is strong support for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite Chavez's shrinking voter preference, a divided opposition still places him in first place, showcasing the resilience of his radical supporters. However, the study suggests a potential power struggle, with the number of extreme Chavez opponents surpassing that of his extreme supporters. The Venezuelan people are expressing their dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs and are seeking solutions through institutional means or leadership changes.
END OF SUMMARY.
