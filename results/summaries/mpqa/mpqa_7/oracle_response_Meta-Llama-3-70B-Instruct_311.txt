SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant and sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, mirroring the latest polls. The study found that over half of the respondents believe it is necessary to remove Chavez from office to solve the crisis, with 49% advocating for institutional channels and 5% supporting forceful means. The President's approval rating has plummeted from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while his disapproval rating has surged to 58%. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of respondents believing that many poor people oppose Chavez. The study also shows a clear majority (75%) in favor of a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Chavez's popularity continues to decline, with 57.4% of respondents feeling worse off than in the past and 93% disapproving of the government's handling of insecurity and unemployment problems. The President is facing a crisis of unresolved problems, a drop in popularity, and a perception of being an incapable leader, leading to a decline in his ability to keep hope. END OF SUMMARY.
