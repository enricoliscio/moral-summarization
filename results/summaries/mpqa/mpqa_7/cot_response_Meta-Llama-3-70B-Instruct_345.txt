SUMMARY:
A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the sustained fall of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing it is necessary to remove him from office to solve the crisis. The study reveals a collapse of the myth of a polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing there are many poor who oppose him. The results also show a clear pronouncement in favor of calling a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Chavez's edge in voter's preference continues to shrink, with 57.4% of those polled feeling bad or worse than in the past and 55.3% believing their main problems are in the economic area. Venezuelans are feeling pessimistic again, and 80% believe there is a solution for the unemployment problem, blaming Chavez's incapacity. END OF SUMMARY.
