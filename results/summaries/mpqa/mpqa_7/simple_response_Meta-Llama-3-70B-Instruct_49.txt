SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled believing he should be removed from office to solve the crisis. The study also shows a drop in the President's approval rating, from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November. Furthermore, 75% of those polled agree with calling a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. The study highlights the collapse of the myth of polarization between rich and poor, with 78% of those polled believing there are many poor who oppose Chavez. The effects of a divided opposition still keep him in first place, but his edge in voter's preference continues to shrink. The moral takeaway from this study is that Chavez's leadership is facing a crisis of legitimacy, with a growing number of Venezuelans losing faith in his ability to solve the country's problems.

END OF SUMMARY.
