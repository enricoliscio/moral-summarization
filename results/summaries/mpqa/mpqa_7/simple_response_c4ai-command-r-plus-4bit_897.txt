SUMMARY: Recent polls reveal a sharp decline in the popularity of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, with over half of those surveyed believing he should be removed from office. This shift in public opinion reflects a rejection of the wealthy-poor divide that characterized Chavez's early support and highlights the growing perception of his administration as incapable of addressing key issues like unemployment and insecurity. The study also indicates a strong preference for a referendum to re-establish a balance of power and a shrinking lead for Chavez in voter preference due to a divided opposition. These findings underscore the public's desire for change and their waning confidence in Chavez's leadership. The results demonstrate a complex political landscape in Venezuela, where Chavez's personal qualities remain a factor, yet the call for his removal, whether through institutional or forceful means, is a significant development. The poll underscores the urgency of addressing the nation's problems and the public's willingness to consider alternative leadership.
