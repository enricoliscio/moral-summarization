SUMMARY: Recent polls have revealed a sharp decline in the popularity of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. More than half of those polled believe that Chavez needs to be removed from office, and there is a clear preference for a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. The study also reflects a collapse of the rich-poor divide myth, with 78% believing that there are many poor who oppose Chavez. Chavez still leads in voter preference, but his lead has shrunk significantly. The findings suggest that Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic about the government's ability to resolve key issues such as unemployment and insecurity, and this is reflected in the drop in Chavez's approval ratings. The polls indicate a growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's leadership and a potential power struggle between extreme opponents and supporters of the president. This shift in public opinion highlights the importance of effective governance and the need for leaders to address the concerns of their citizens to maintain their legitimacy and support.
