Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me look at the article again to understand the key points and the moral words.

First, the article talks about a study by Alfredo Keller showing a drop in Chavez's approval ratings. The main moral terms used are crisis, problems, insecurity, unemployment, decline, unresolved, incapable, happening, solution, problem, solved, incapacity, responsible, ability, shrinking. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The study found that over half of those polled think Chavez should be removed. Some support it through institutional means, while a small percentage support force. The approval rating has dropped from 84% to 33%, and disapproval has risen to 58%. This shows a decline in his support.

The article also mentions the myth of polarization between rich and poor. Only 20% think the rich oppose him, but 78% think the poor do. This suggests a shift in public perception, moving away from the initial polarization.

There's a strong support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% agreeing. Despite this, Chavez still leads in voter preference, though his lead is shrinking. His main issues are unemployment and insecurity, with high disapproval on these fronts.

Other pollsters like Datanalisis and Consultores 21 back up the decline. Venezuelans feel pessimistic, seeing Chavez as incapable, and more oppose him than support him. His ability to inspire hope is shrinking, which is a key factor in his declining support.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points and the moral words. It should be concise, around 200 words. Let me structure it to cover the main findings, the shift in polarization, the referendum support, and the reasons behind the decline, using the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: A recent study by Alfredo Keller reveals a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, reflecting a growing crisis of confidence among Venezuelans. Over half of those polled believe Chavez should be removed from office to address the nation's problems, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting forceful methods. Approval ratings have dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33%, while disapproval has risen to 58%. This trend challenges the initial polarization between rich and poor, as only 20% see the wealthy opposing Chavez, while 78% of respondents believe many poor Venezuelans now oppose him. A strong majority (75%) supports a referendum to redraft the Constitution, though Chavez remains first in voter preference, albeit with shrinking margins. His leadership is increasingly criticized for unresolved issues like unemployment and insecurity, with 43% of Venezuelans finding no positive aspects in his government's actions. Chavez's personal strengths, such as his desire to work, are seen as campaigning traits rather than those of an effective leader. His ability to inspire hope is waning, and the number of extreme opponents (42%) now surpasses that of supporters (18%), signaling a potential confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
