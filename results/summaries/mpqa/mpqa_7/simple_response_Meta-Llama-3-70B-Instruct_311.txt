SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with over half of the respondents believing that removing him from office is necessary to solve the crisis. The study also shows a drop in Chavez's popularity, with his disapproval rating reaching 58% and approval rating at 33%. The myth of a polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, with 78% of respondents believing that many poor people oppose Chavez. The study suggests that a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power is widely supported, with 75% in favor. Despite Chavez's declining popularity, he still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. The opposition remains divided, which keeps him in first place. The study highlights the growing discontent among Venezuelans, with 57.4% feeling that their situation has worsened and 93% disapproving of the government's job.
