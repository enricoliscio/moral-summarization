SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the decline of President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. The study, conducted among 1,000 adults from different socioeconomic groups in Venezuela, found that more than half of those polled believe that Chavez should be removed from office to solve the crisis. Only 43% prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. The study also showed a drop in Chavez's approval rating, from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November. Additionally, 75% of those polled agree with calling a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite Chavez's declining popularity, he still leads voter's preference with 25% of the vote, followed by Henrique Salas Romer with 21%.
