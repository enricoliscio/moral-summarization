Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article about Hugo Chavez's falling approval ratings. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article mentions that Alfredo Keller's study shows a significant drop in Chavez's approval ratings. It started at 84% and is now down to 33%, with disapproval at 58%. That's a big shift. Also, more than half of those polled think Chavez should be removed, with some preferring institutional means and a few supporting force. Interesting, that shows some frustration but mostly within the system.

Another point is the collapse of the rich-poor polarization myth. Initially, people thought the rich were against Chavez, but now most believe many poor oppose him. That's a shift in perception, indicating maybe Chavez isn't connecting as well with his base anymore.

The study also shows strong support for a constitutional referendum, with 75% agreeing. This suggests people want change but through legal channels. The opposition is divided, which keeps Chavez in first place, but his lead is shrinking. Other candidates are gaining traction, like Alfredo Pena.

The article also mentions other polls showing Venezuelans are pessimistic, with high disapproval on security and unemployment. Chavez's popularity is dropping, and people are attributing problems to him. His strengths are his personal qualities, but that's more for a candidate than a leader.

So, the moral framing here is about the people's dissatisfaction and the potential for change. The author is highlighting the loss of support, the reasons behind it, and the possible consequences for Chavez's leadership. I need to capture that in the summary without losing the critical perspective.

I should structure the summary to include the key statistics, the shift in public opinion, the support for a referendum, and the implications for Chavez's leadership. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it flows well. Let me start drafting that.

SUMMARY: Recent polls indicate a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating in Venezuela, reflecting growing public dissatisfaction. Alfredo Keller's study shows his approval rating dropped from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. Over half of respondents believe Chavez should be removed from office, with 49% favoring institutional channels and 5% supporting forceful means. The study also reveals a shift in public perception: only 20% believe the wealthy oppose Chavez, while 78% think many poor Venezuelans do. Support for a constitutional referendum to restore power balance is strong, with 75% agreeing. Despite a divided opposition, Chavez remains first in voter preference, though his lead has shrunk. Other candidates, like Alfredo Pena, are gaining traction. The polls highlight Venezuelans' pessimism about the economy, insecurity, and unemployment, with 43% finding nothing positive in the government's actions. Chavez's personal qualities and work ethic are his main strengths, but his ability to inspire hope is waning. END OF SUMMARY.
