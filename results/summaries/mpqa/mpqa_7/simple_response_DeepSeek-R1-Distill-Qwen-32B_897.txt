Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about Hugo Chavez's approval ratings. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what "moral framing" means here. Maybe it refers to the tone or perspective the article takes, like whether it's critical or supportive of Chavez.

Looking at the article, it's talking about a decline in Chavez's popularity. The study shows his approval rating dropping from 84% to 33%, which is a significant drop. The article also mentions that more people disapprove of him than approve now. That's a clear negative trend.

I should also note the reasons behind the disapproval. The article says people are blaming Chavez for economic issues, unemployment, and insecurity. That's important because it shows the public's perception of his leadership. Plus, there's a mention of people wanting a referendum to change the constitution, which indicates a desire for change in governance.

Another point is the split in the opposition, which keeps Chavez in first place despite his declining support. That's an interesting dynamic because it shows that while he's losing support, the opposition isn't united enough to challenge him effectively.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key points. I should start by stating the main finding about the approval rating drop, then mention the reasons, the referendum support, and the opposition split. I'll structure it to flow logically from the overall trend to the specific factors contributing to it.

Also, I should avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the information given. The user wants the summary to reflect the author's moral framing, so I'll ensure the tone stays neutral but factual, highlighting the negative trends without adding any bias.

Alright, putting it all together, I'll draft a summary that includes the approval rating numbers, the reasons for disapproval, the referendum support, and the opposition dynamics. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key. I'll double-check to make sure all the main points are covered and that the summary flows well.

SUMMARY: Recent polls indicate a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, dropping from 84% in 1999 to 33% in November, while disapproval rose to 58%. A majority (54%) believe Chavez should be removed from office to address the crisis, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting forceful methods. Meanwhile, 43% prefer letting him complete his term. The study also shows a collapse of the "rich vs. poor" polarization narrative, with 78% of respondents believing many poor oppose Chavez. Support for a constitutional referendum to restore power balance is strong, with 75% in favor. Despite declining support, Chavez remains first in voter preference, though his lead has shrunk due to a divided opposition. His personal strengths, such as determination, are seen as campaign traits rather than presidential qualities. Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic, with 80% believing unemployment can be solved, and 40% blaming Chavez for the issue. Extreme opposition to Chavez (42%) now exceeds extreme support (18%), raising the specter of potential confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
