Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task. The user wants me to identify all the morally framed words in the article and then write a concise summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral implications. Words like "fall," "crisis," "replace," "forceful means," "approval," "disapproval," "polarization," "myth," "oppose," "referendum," "redraft," "balance of power," "strength," "radical," "divided," "problems," "unemployment," "insecurity," "expectations," "pessimistic," "incapable," "solution," "blame," "extreme," "confrontation," "strength," and "preference" come to mind. These words carry moral or evaluative connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. The key points are the drop in Chavez's approval rating, the majority wanting a referendum, the shift in public opinion, and the challenges Chavez faces. I'll structure the summary to highlight these points, using the identified moral words to convey the sentiment accurately.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the main findings, then the reasons behind the drop in popularity, and finally the implications for Chavez's leadership. I'll make sure to include percentages and specific details to maintain accuracy while keeping it concise.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me put it all together, making sure each sentence contributes to the overall summary without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The latest polls reveal a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with 58% disapproving and 33% approving as of November. Over half of respondents believe Chavez should be removed from office to address the crisis, with 49% favoring institutional means and 5% supporting force. Only 43% prefer letting him complete his term. The myth of polarization between rich and poor has collapsed, as 78% of those polled believe many poor oppose Chavez. A strong majority (75%) supports a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore power balance. Despite shrinking voter preference, Chavez remains in first place, though his lead has dropped from 40% to 24%. His strengths, such as personal qualities and work ethic, are seen as campaigning traits rather than presidential strengths. Venezuelans are increasingly pessimistic, blaming Chavez for unresolved issues like unemployment and insecurity. The number of extreme Chavez opponents (42%) now exceeds supporters (18%), raising the risk of political confrontation. END OF SUMMARY.
