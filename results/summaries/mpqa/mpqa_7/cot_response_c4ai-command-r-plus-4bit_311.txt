SUMMARY:
The latest polls reveal a significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating, with more than half of those polled advocating for his removal from office. The study highlights a shift in public opinion, indicating a collapse of the rich-poor polarization myth that characterized the beginning of his administration. The results show that 78 percent believe there are many poor who oppose Chavez, and a clear preference for a referendum to restore the balance of power. Despite a shrinking voter base, Chavez remains in first place due to a divided opposition. However, his strengths lie in personal qualities and campaigning abilities rather than his performance as president. The analysis identifies four key ingredients for the decline of a government, including unresolved problems, a drop in popularity, perception of incapability, and the emergence of substitute leaders. With Venezuelans blaming Chavez for the country's problems, the president is losing his ability to inspire hope. The study also reveals a growing number of extreme opponents, which could lead to a confrontation for power. Overall, the polls indicate a decline in Chavez's popularity and a critical view of his governance.
