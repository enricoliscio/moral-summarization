SUMMARY:

A recent study by Alfredo Keller confirms the significant decline in President Hugo Chavez's approval rating. The study, conducted among 1,000 adults from various socioeconomic groups, shows that more than half of the respondents believe Chavez should be removed from office to solve the crisis. Only 43% prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. The study also reveals a drop in Chavez's approval rating, from 84% in April 1999 to 33% in November. Additionally, 75% of respondents support a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power. Despite his declining popularity, Chavez still leads voter preference, but his edge is shrinking. Other presidential candidates, such as Henrique Salas Romer and Julio Borges, are gaining ground.

END OF SUMMARY.
