SUMMARY: A US human rights report accuses Namibian security forces and the government of various human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute dismisses the report, arguing that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. He also points out factual inaccuracies in the report, such as confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers with the ruling party. Shivute argues that the US has committed similar or worse actions, such as the detention of prisoners of war and 'enemies' of the state after the September 11 attacks, and questions the moral double standard applied by the US. He suggests that human rights violations are only deemed unacceptable when committed by other nations, but not when committed by the US itself. Namibia gives "little value" to the US report due to its inaccuracies and the selective moral framing employed by the US.

END OF SUMMARY.
