SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report details extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and beatings of citizens suspected of complicity with Unita. It also cites cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and denial of fair public hearings. The government has responded by pointing out the US's own human rights abuses, including the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claims the report is inaccurate and carries a "total confusion" of historical data. However, the report highlights the government's failure to account for the whereabouts of detained persons and its denial of fair public hearings. The government's response has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of the violations and attempting to deflect attention by pointing to the US's own human rights abuses.
