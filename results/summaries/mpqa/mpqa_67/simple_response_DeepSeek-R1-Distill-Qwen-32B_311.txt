Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances. The violations are linked to operations against UNITA and the Caprivi Liberation Army. The report mentions that the Namibian Constitution wasn't upheld in these cases.

The Namibian government, through their Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, responds by criticizing the US for being hypocritical. He points out the US's own human rights issues, like Guantanamo Bay detentions without trial. Shivute argues that the US report is inaccurate and filled with errors, such as incorrect information about media ownership and political affiliations.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points: the US report's accusations, the government's dismissal, Shivute's counterarguments about US hypocrisy, and the inaccuracies in the report. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral framing, which emphasizes the US's hypocrisy and Namibia's defense against the report's inaccuracies.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the dismissal of the report, mention the violations, then Shivute's response about US hypocrisy, and finally the inaccuracies in the report. Keep each point concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of committing human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi regions. The report highlighted disappearances, deaths in custody, and failures to adhere to constitutional rights, with many abuses linked to the Special Field Force (SFF). Namibia's Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the report was inaccurate and filled with errors, such as incorrect claims about media ownership and political affiliations. He questioned whether similar actions by the US would be labeled human rights abuses. Namibia, he said, attaches little value to the report due to its factual inaccuracies. END OF SUMMARY.
