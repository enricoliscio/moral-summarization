Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a concise summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia of various human rights violations, and the government responds by criticizing the US's own record, particularly Guantanamo Bay.

For Step 1, I need to identify single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that imply judgment or evaluation. Words like "trashed," "violations," "worst," "detention," "extra-judicial," "killings," "deaths," "account," "detained," "tortured," "beat," "abuses," "Constitution," "informed," "magistrate," "48 hours," "suspicious," "disappeared," "value," "inaccuracies," "reproduction," "unverified," "substantiated," "confusion," "historical," "affiliated." These words are all charged with moral implications, so they fit the criteria.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, keeping the morally framed words intact. I'll start by stating the government's dismissal of the report. Then mention the specific criticisms from the US report, like extra-judicial killings and torture. I'll include Shivute's response, highlighting the US's own issues with Guantanamo. I'll also note the inaccuracies and confusion in the report, as well as the government's dismissal of the report's credibility.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the dismissal, detailing the report's claims, the government's counterarguments, and concluding with the implications of the US's own actions. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone and framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered without losing the moral context. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

### SUMMARY:  
The Namibian government dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of committing human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report highlighted abuses in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions, particularly by the Special Field Force (SFF), and criticized the government for failing to uphold constitutional rights, such as informing detainees of their arrest and bringing them before a magistrate within 48 hours. The report also accused the government of targeting individuals suspected of links with UNITA and the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), with many disappearing without trace.  

In response, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for being a "worst human rights violator," citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and claimed it contained "unverified" and "unsubstantiated" information, including errors about media ownership and historical affiliations. He questioned whether the US's actions in Afghanistan and after 9/11 would be labeled as human rights abuses or excused due to the country's status. The government attached "little value" to the report, deeming it unreliable.  
END OF SUMMARY.
