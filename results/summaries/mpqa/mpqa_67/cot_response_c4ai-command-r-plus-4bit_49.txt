SUMMARY: 
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that documented several violations by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and other cruel and degrading treatment by security forces during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions in 2001. It also mentions arbitrary arrests, detentions, and disappearances, with many people detained on the basis of suspected links to rebel groups. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, strongly criticized the US, calling them the worst human rights violator and highlighting their detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute also pointed out inaccuracies and a lack of verification in the US report, stating that Namibia attaches "little value" to it. He questioned the moral ground of the US, bringing up their post-9/11 actions and the war in Afghanistan, where similar human rights abuses were committed. The US report charged Namibia with failing to uphold constitutional rights, such as informing arrestees of the reason for their arrest and bringing them before a magistrate within 48 hours.
