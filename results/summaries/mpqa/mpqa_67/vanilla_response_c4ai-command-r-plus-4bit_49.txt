SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that documented various human rights violations committed by Namibian security forces and the government in 2001. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report listed extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair public hearings as human rights abuses in Namibia. It also noted that the Namibian Constitution was not always upheld, with many arrests based on suspected links to rebel groups. Shivute criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified claims, such as mistaking the ruling party paper, Namibia Today, as a government-owned magazine. He also pointed out the report's confusion regarding the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW). The Namibian government considered the report to carry little value due to these inaccuracies.

END OF SUMMARY.
