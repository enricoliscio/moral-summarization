Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The government of Namibia dismissed a US human rights report, which accused them of various violations. The report mentions extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The Namibian government, through Shivute, counters by pointing out US hypocrisy, referencing Guantanamo Bay and their own human rights issues.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "trashed," "violations," "killings," "tortured," etc., should be included. I'll structure the summary to first mention the dismissal of the report, then the accusations from the US report, followed by the Namibian government's response highlighting US hypocrisy. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral tone is maintained.

I should also note that the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to paraphrase the key points without adding any new information, just condensing the article while keeping the moral language intact.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government dismissed a US human rights report that accused security forces and the government of numerous human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report highlighted abuses by the Special Field Force (SFF) in the Kavango and Caprivi regions, where suspects were detained without proper legal process and some disappeared. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for its own human rights violations, such as detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the US report contained factual inaccuracies and was based on unverified claims, dismissing it as a "mere reproduction" of unsubstantiated information. He questioned whether similar actions by the US, such as detaining prisoners during the Afghanistan war, would be labeled as human rights abuses. The government accused the report of errors, including mischaracterizing media affiliations and historical data. END OF SUMMARY.
