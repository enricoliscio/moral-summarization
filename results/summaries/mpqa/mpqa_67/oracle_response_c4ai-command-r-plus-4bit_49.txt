SUMMARY: The Namibian government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documents numerous human rights violations by security forces and the government. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered by accusing the US government of being the world's worst human rights violator, specifically citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, and other cruel and inhumane treatment by Namibian security forces during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also claims that the government failed to provide accountability for these actions and that arrests were made without informing individuals of the reasons or bringing them before a magistrate within the mandated 48 hours. The report further charges Namibia with arbitrary arrests and denial of fair public hearings, with many arrests based on suspected links to rebel groups. Shivute dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and unverified, accusing the US of hypocrisy given its own human rights record post-9/11. He also corrected the report's claim that the ruling party publication, Namibia Today, is government-owned.

END OF SUMMARY.
