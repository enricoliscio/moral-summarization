SUMMARY: The Namibian government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documents several human rights violations by Namibian security forces and the Government in 2001, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, countered by accusing the US government of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. He also criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified claims, such as confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers with the ruling party. Shivute questioned the hypocrisy of the US, highlighting post-9/11 actions and the war in Afghanistan, where similar or worse human rights abuses were committed. Namibia dismissed the report as carrying little value due to its inaccuracies and failure to acknowledge the context of the security operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions.
END OF SUMMARY.
