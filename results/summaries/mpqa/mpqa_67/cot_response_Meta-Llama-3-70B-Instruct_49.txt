SUMMARY:
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, torture, and beatings of citizens suspected of complicity with Unita, as well as arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and denial of fair public hearings. The government responded by calling the US the "worst human rights violator" in the world, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claimed the report contained factual inaccuracies and was a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". The report's findings were dismissed as "total confusion" of historical data. The government attached "little value" to the report, which it deemed to be hypocritical in light of the US's own human rights abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
