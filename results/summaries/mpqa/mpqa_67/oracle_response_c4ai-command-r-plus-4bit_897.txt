SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that documents several human rights violations by security forces and the Government. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, strongly criticized the US government as the worst human rights violator, highlighting the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report accuses Namibian security forces of extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and other inhumane treatments during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also mentions arbitrary arrests, disappearances, and denial of fair trials, with many arrests based on suspected links to rebel groups. Shivute countered by pointing out similar and worse human rights abuses committed by the US post 9/11 and during the war in Afghanistan. He questioned the double standards and factual inaccuracies in the US report, stating that Namibia places little value on it.
