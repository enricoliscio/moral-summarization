SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report alleges extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi regions. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government's Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, claimed that the US report contains factual inaccuracies and is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". Shivute also pointed out that the report mistakenly claimed that a ruling party paper was government-owned and contained historical data errors. The government has attached "little value" to the report.
