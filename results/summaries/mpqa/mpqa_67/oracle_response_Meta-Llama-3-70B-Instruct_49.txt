SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists numerous human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report details extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, beatings, and arbitrary arrests, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also cites cases of disappearance, arbitrary deprivation of life, and denial of fair public hearings. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator in the world, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claims the report contains factual inaccuracies and is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". However, the report's findings of human rights abuses, including torture, beatings, and disappearances, are a cause for concern and warrant attention.
