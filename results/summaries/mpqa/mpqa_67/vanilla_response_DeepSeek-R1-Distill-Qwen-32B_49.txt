Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various human rights violations like extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The government, through Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute, responds by criticizing the US, pointing out their own human rights issues like Guantanamo Bay detentions.

I should start by mentioning that Namibia's government dismissed the US report. Then list the main points from the report: extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, especially by the SFF. Also, note that the Constitution wasn't followed regarding arrests and detentions.

Next, include Shivute's response. He criticizes the US, citing Guantanamo and their handling of 9/11 and Afghanistan. He argues that if the US does it, it's not seen as abuse, so why should Namibia be judged differently. He also says the report has inaccuracies, like misclassifying Namibia Today and NUNW's affiliation.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include all key points: the report's accusations, the government's dismissal, Shivute's counterpoints, and the inaccuracies he mentions.

Let me structure it: start with the dismissal, then the report's findings, Shivute's response, and the inaccuracies. Keep each sentence clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accuses the country's security forces of numerous human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report, released this week, highlights abuses committed by the Special Field Force (SFF) in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions during 2001, noting that many detainees disappeared without trial. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for its own human rights record, citing the detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the report contained factual inaccuracies, such as misclassifying Namibia Today as a government-owned publication and incorrectly stating the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) with the ruling Swapo Party. He dismissed the report, stating that Namibia attaches "little value" to it. END OF SUMMARY.
