SUMMARY: The Namibian government vehemently refuted a US human rights report accusing its security forces and government of various human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute strongly criticized the US for its own human rights record, specifically citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the US report lacked factual accuracy and contained unverified information, dismissing it as carrying little value. He also pointed out the hypocrisy of the US in committing similar or worse human rights abuses, particularly in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The US report alleged that Namibian security forces committed extra-judicial killings and that the government failed to account for the whereabouts of some detainees. It also claimed that the Namibian Constitution's provisions for arrest procedures were not being followed. The Namibian government countered by highlighting factual inaccuracies and arguing that the report failed to acknowledge the context of security operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. END OF SUMMARY.
