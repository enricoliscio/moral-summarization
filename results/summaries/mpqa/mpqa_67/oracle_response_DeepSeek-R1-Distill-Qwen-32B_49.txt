Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The government dismissed a US human rights report, and the permanent secretary criticized the US for its own human rights issues. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. Shivute points out the US's hypocrisy by mentioning Guantanamo Bay and the treatment after 9/11. He also criticizes the report for inaccuracies and confusion. 

I should include the morally charged words like "trashed," "violations," "killings," "tortured," etc. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the government's dismissal of the report. Then mention the specific violations highlighted. Include Shivute's criticism of the US, using the Guantanamo example. Also, note his points about the report's inaccuracies and confusion. 

I'll structure it to flow logically: government's response, the report's accusations, Shivute's counterarguments, and the conclusion about the report's value. I'll make sure to use as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of numerous violations, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The report highlighted abuses by the Special Field Force, such as disappearances, torture, and denial of fair hearings, often linked to suspected ties with UNITA or the Caprivi Liberation Army. Shivute argued that similar actions by the US, like building special camps during the Afghanistan war, were not condemned, questioning the double standard. He dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and confused, noting errors like misclassifying media affiliations. Namibia, he said, attached little value to the report. END OF SUMMARY.
