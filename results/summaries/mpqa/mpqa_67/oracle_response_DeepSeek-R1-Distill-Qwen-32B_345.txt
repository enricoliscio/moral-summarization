Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various human rights violations, like extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The government's response is that the US is hypocritical because of Guantanamo Bay detentions without trial.

I should identify the morally framed words the author used: trashed, violations, killings, deaths, account, tortured, beat, deprivation, disappearance, torture, treatment, arrest, denial, abuses, informed, case, arrested, disappeared, happened, attacks, actions, reports.

My summary needs to include as many of these words as possible. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence while maintaining the moral tone.

I'll start by stating the government dismissed the report, using "trashed." Then mention the violations, killings, deaths, torture, etc. Include Shivute's points about the US's hypocrisy, citing Guantanamo. Also, note the inaccuracies in the report, like the Namibia Today affiliation and NUNW confusion.

I should structure it to flow logically: government's dismissal, the report's claims, Shivute's response, and the inaccuracies. Make sure to use the moral terms to highlight the issues.

Let me draft a few sentences and check the word count. I need to be concise but include all key points without making it too long. Maybe two or three sentences each for the report's accusations, the government's response, and the inaccuracies.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary, making sure to include the morally charged words and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of numerous violations, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report highlighted cases of torture, disappearance, and denial of fair hearings, with many abuses linked to the Special Field Force (SFF). Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that Namibia attached little value to the report due to factual inaccuracies, such as misrepresenting Namibia Today as a government-owned publication and confusing historical data about the NUNW's affiliation with Swapo. He questioned whether similar US actions during the September 11 attacks and Afghan war would be labeled as human rights abuses. The report also accused Namibia of arresting individuals based on suspected ties to UNITA and the CLA, with many disappearing without trace. END OF SUMMARY.
