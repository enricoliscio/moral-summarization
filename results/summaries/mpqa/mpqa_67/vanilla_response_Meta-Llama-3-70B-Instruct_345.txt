SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists various human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report alleges extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi regions. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government has also disputed the accuracy of the report, claiming it contains factual inaccuracies and unverified information. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, has stated that Namibia attaches "little value" to the report and has questioned the US's own human rights record, particularly in the wake of the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan.
