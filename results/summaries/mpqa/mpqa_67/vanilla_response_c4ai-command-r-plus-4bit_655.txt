SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that documents several human rights violations by Namibian security forces and the government in 2001. The report includes accounts of extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair public hearings. In response, the Namibian Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, accused the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute also criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified claims, such as mistaking the ruling party paper, Namibia Today, as a government-owned magazine. He further questioned the US's own human rights record post-9/11 and in the war in Afghanistan. Namibia has dismissed the report as carrying little value and demanded an apology from the US for its "unsubstantiated" claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
