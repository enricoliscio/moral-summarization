SUMMARY:
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. The government has responded by pointing out the US's own human rights abuses, such as the detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The Namibian government has called the report "factual inaccuracies" and a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". The government has also accused the US of committing worse human rights abuses, such as arbitrary deprivation of life and disappearance of people, after the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The government has attached "little value" to the report, citing its inaccuracies and bias. END OF SUMMARY.
