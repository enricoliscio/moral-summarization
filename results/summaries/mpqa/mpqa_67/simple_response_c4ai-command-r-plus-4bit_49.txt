SUMMARY: A US report accuses Namibia of various human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests by security forces. Namibia's Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, strongly refutes these claims, arguing that the US has committed far worse human rights abuses, such as the detention of 300 people without trial at Guantanamo Bay. Shivute also points out factual inaccuracies in the report, such as confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers, and maintains that Namibia values human rights, contrary to the US's own actions post-9/11 and in the war in Afghanistan. He questions the hypocrisy and double standards of the US in criticizing other nations for human rights abuses while committing similar and more egregious acts itself.

END OF SUMMARY.
