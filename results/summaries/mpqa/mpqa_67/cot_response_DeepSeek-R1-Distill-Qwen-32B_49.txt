Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified a two-step process: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "trashed," "violations," "abuses," "killings," "tortured," "beat," "deprived," "disappear," "cruel," "degrading," "arbitrary," "deny," "unverified," "unsubstantiated," "confusion," and "affiliated" stand out as they carry strong moral implications. These words highlight the negative actions and the government's dismissal of the report.

Moving on to the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, ensuring that the moral framing is maintained. The key points are the US report's allegations against Namibia, the government's dismissal of the report by citing US hypocrisy, and the specific human rights issues mentioned. I'll structure the summary to first state the dismissal, then outline the report's allegations, and finally include Shivute's rebuttal, emphasizing the moral critique of the US's own actions.

I should make sure to include the morally framed words identified earlier to preserve the original tone. Also, I'll need to keep the summary clear and concise, ensuring it captures all the essential elements without being too verbose. 

I'll start by stating that Namibia dismissed the US report, then list the violations mentioned, followed by Shivute's counterarguments pointing out US hypocrisy. This structure should effectively convey the moral framing while keeping the summary within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Namibian government dismissed a US human rights report detailing alleged violations by Namibian security forces, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its own human rights abuses, such as detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The report accused Namibia's Special Field Force (SFF) of committing abuses against suspected links to UNITA and the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), despite constitutional protections. Shivute argued that the report contained inaccuracies, such as mislabeling Namibia Today as a government-owned publication and confusing historical data about the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW). He questioned whether similar US actions would be labeled as human rights abuses or excused due to the country's status. The government deemed the report of little value, emphasizing its factual errors and moral inconsistency.
