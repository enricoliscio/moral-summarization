SUMMARY: The Namibian government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documented numerous rights violations by security forces and the Government in the country. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered by accusing the US of being the world's worst human rights violator, specifically mentioning the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report highlighted extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrests by Namibian security forces during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions in 2001. It also noted that the Namibian Constitution was not upheld, as those arrested were not informed of the reasons for their detention and were not brought before a magistrate within the mandated 48-hour period. Many arrests were made based on suspected links to Unita and the CLA, and people have disappeared without a trace. Shivute questioned the US's moral ground, citing post-9/11 actions and the war in Afghanistan as examples of American hypocrisy. He also criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified claims, such as confusing the affiliation of the NUNW with Swapo. Namibia dismissed the report as carrying little value.
