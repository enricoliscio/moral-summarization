Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed.

They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. The article provided is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and placed between "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read the article to get the main points. The key elements are:

- Namibia's government dismisses a US human rights report.
- The report accuses Namibia's security forces of human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances.
- The government responds by criticizing the US, pointing out their own issues like Guantanamo Bay detentions.
- The report mentions specific regions (Kavango and Caprivi) and links to UNITA and CLA.
- The government claims the report has inaccuracies and factual errors.

I need to condense this into a summary that captures all these points without going over 200 words. I'll start by stating the dismissal, then outline the report's allegations, the government's counterarguments, and the inaccuracies they mention.

I should ensure the summary is clear and sticks to the main facts. Also, I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward. Let me structure it step by step to make sure I cover each point concisely.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of committing human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances in 2001. The report highlighted abuses in the Kavango and Caprivi regions, linking them to suspected ties with UNITA and the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA). Namibia's Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its own human rights issues, such as detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the report contained factual inaccuracies, including misrepresentations about Namibia's media and political affiliations, and dismissed it as unreliable. The government maintained that the report's allegations were unsubstantiated and did not reflect Namibia's commitment to human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
