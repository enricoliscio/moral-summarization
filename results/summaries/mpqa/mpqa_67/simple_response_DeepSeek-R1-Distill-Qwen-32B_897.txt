Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia of human rights violations by its security forces, including extra-judicial killings and torture. The government responds by criticizing the US for its own human rights issues, like Guantanamo Bay detentions. 

I should start by highlighting the main points: the US report's accusations, the government's dismissal, and their counter-arguments. It's important to include the specific violations mentioned, such as deaths in custody and disappearances. Also, the government's retort about the US's hypocrisy needs to be included to show the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: first, the report's findings, then the government's response, and finally their criticism of the US. I should make sure to mention the specific issues like Guantanamo Bay and the comparison to post-9/11 actions. Also, note that the government called the report inaccurate and confused.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures the essence without getting too detailed. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accuses its security forces of committing human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, particularly targeting suspected links with Unita and the Caprivi Liberation Army. The report also highlights failures to adhere to legal protections, such as informing detainees of their rights and bringing them before a magistrate within 48 hours. In response, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial and its own human rights abuses during the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. Shivute dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and misleading, claiming it misrepresented Namibia's political landscape, such as incorrectly stating that Namibia Today is a government-owned publication and confusing historical data about the National Union of Namibian Workers. The government's dismissal underscores a broader critique of the US's moral authority to judge Namibia's human rights record. END OF SUMMARY.
