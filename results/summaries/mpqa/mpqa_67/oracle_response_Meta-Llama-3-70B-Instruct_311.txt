SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists numerous violations committed by security forces and the government. The report details extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and beatings of citizens suspected of complicity with Unita. It also cites cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and denial of fair public hearings. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator in the world, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claims the report is inaccurate and a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". However, the report's findings suggest a pattern of abuses committed by the Special Field Force (SFF) members, including arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture, and disappearances. The government's response has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of these human rights violations.
