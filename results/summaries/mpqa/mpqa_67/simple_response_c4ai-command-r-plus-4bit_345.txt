SUMMARY: A US human rights report accuses Namibian security forces and the government of various human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute dismisses the report, arguing that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. He also points out factual inaccuracies in the report, such as confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers. Shivute accuses the US of applying double standards to human rights, committing similar or worse abuses in the name of national security. Namibia considers the report to have little value due to its inaccuracies and unverified claims.
