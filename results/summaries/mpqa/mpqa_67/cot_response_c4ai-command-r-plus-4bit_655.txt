SUMMARY: 
Namibia's government has vehemently refuted a US human rights report that accuses the Namibian security forces and government of several human rights violations. The report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair trials, among other inhumane acts, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered by asserting that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute also pointed out factual inaccuracies and a lack of verification in the US report, arguing that Namibia places little value on its findings. He highlighted the report's confusion between the ruling party and the government and its outdated information about trade union affiliations. Namibia's response underscores its rejection of the US report's allegations and its criticism of US human rights practices.
