SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that documents several human rights violations by Namibian security forces and the government in 2001. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, arbitrary arrest, and denial of fair public hearings by Namibian security forces, particularly the Special Field Force. It also claims that the Namibian government failed to inform detainees of the reasons for their arrest and did not bring them before a magistrate within the constitutionally mandated 48-hour period. Shivute dismissed the report as inaccurate and unverified, stating that it contained factual errors and confused historical data. He also criticized the report for claiming that the ruling party's publication, Namibia Today, is government-owned, and for stating that the National Union of Namibian Workers is no longer affiliated with the ruling party, Swapo.
