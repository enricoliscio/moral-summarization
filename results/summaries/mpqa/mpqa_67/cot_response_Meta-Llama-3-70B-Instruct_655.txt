SUMMARY:
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, among other abuses. However, the government has responded by calling the US the "worst human rights violator in the world", citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claims that the report contains factual inaccuracies and is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". The report's findings, including the arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and cruel treatment, are dismissed as unreliable. The government's response raises questions about double standards, with the Information Permanent Secretary asking whether similar actions committed by the US would be considered human rights abuses.
