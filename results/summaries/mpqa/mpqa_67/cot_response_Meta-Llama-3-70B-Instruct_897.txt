SUMMARY:
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, among other abuses. In response, the government's Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, claimed that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute argued that the US report is hypocritical, as it does not hold the US to the same standards. He also pointed out factual inaccuracies in the report, calling it a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". The government has attached "little value" to the report, which it sees as a "total confusion" of historical data. END OF SUMMARY.
