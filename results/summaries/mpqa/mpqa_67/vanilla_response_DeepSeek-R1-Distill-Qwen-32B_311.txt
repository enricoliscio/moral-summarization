Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various human rights violations like extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The government's response is through Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute, who criticizes the US for being hypocritical, citing Guantanamo Bay detentions. He also points out inaccuracies in the report, such as misclassifying media affiliations and historical data. The summary should capture the main points: the US report's accusations, the government's dismissal, Shivute's arguments, and the key issues mentioned in the report. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too detailed.
