SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists numerous human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and beatings of citizens suspected of complicity with Unita. It also highlights cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and denial of fair public hearings. The government has responded by pointing out the US's own human rights abuses, including the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, argued that the US government is the worst human rights violator in the world, and that the report is inaccurate and biased. Shivute questioned whether the US's actions, such as building special camps to detain prisoners of war and 'enemies' of the state, would be listed as human rights abuses. The government has attached "little value" to the report, citing factual inaccuracies and a "total confusion" of historical data.
