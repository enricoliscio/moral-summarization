SUMMARY: 
Namibia's government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that accuses the country's security forces and government of various human rights violations. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute dismissed the report, stating that the US itself is the worst human rights violator, specifically citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, and other inhumane treatments by Namibian security forces during operations in Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also claims that Namibia has failed to uphold its constitutional obligations by not informing detainees of their rights and not bringing them before a magistrate within the mandated timeframe. 

Shivute countered by pointing out similar and worse actions taken by the US post-9/11 and during the war in Afghanistan, questioning the moral double standard. He also criticized the report for its factual inaccuracies and failure to verify information, such as confusing the ownership of the publication "Namibia Today" and misrepresenting the affiliation between the NUNW and Swapo Party. Namibia considers the report to have little value due to its ethical and factual shortcomings. END OF SUMMARY.
