SUMMARY: A US human rights report detailing various human rights violations committed by Namibian security forces and the government has been dismissed by the Namibian government. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute countered that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The US report for 2001 lists extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair trials in Namibia. It attributes most abuses to the Special Field Force (SFF) and claims that the Namibian government failed to inform detainees of their rights or bring them before a magistrate within 48 hours. Shivute criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified claims, such as mistaking the ruling party paper *Namibia Today* for a government-owned magazine. He also questioned the US's own human rights record post-9/11.
