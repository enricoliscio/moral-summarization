SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that highlights several human rights violations in Namibia, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report alleges that security forces, particularly the Special Field Force, committed these abuses during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions in 2001. In response, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute claimed that the US government is the worst human rights violator in the world, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute also disputed the accuracy of the report, stating that it contains factual inaccuracies and unverified claims. He questioned the credibility of the report, asking whether similar actions by the US would be considered human rights abuses.
