SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists various human rights violations committed by Namibian security forces and the government. The report alleges extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government has also disputed the accuracy of the report, claiming it contains factual inaccuracies and unverified information. The report's allegations include the abuse of citizens suspected of links with Angolan rebel movements, and the government's failure to account for the whereabouts of detained individuals. The government has downplayed the report, attaching "little value" to its findings.
