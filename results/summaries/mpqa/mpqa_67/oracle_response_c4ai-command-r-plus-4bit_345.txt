SUMMARY: The Namibian government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documents a number of human rights violations by security forces and the government, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, countered by accusing the US government of being the worst human rights violator, highlighting the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute dismissed the report as inaccurate and unverified, stating that Namibia places little value on it. He also corrected factual errors and pointed out the report's failure to acknowledge the context of the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The US report charges Namibian security forces with committing extra-judicial killings, torture, and other inhumane acts during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also accuses the government of failing to provide accountability for the disappearances and arbitrary arrests of citizens suspected of links with rebel groups. The report further criticizes Namibia for not adhering to its own constitutional requirements regarding the rights of arrested individuals.
