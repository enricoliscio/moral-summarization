SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists numerous violations committed by security forces and the government. The report highlights extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and beatings of citizens suspected of complicity with Unita. It also cites cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, and denial of fair public hearings. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government has also claimed that the report contains factual inaccuracies and is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". The report's findings are a stark reminder of the government's accountability and transparency issues, with many people arrested on suspicion of links with Unita and the Caprivi Liberation Army, only to disappear without trace.
