SUMMARY: 
Namibia's government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documents a number of human rights violations committed by Namibian security forces and the Government in 2001. The Permanent Secretary of Information, Mocks Shivute, countered by accusing the US government of being the world's worst human rights violator, specifically citing the detention of 300 individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. 

The US report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests, and denial of fair hearings by Namibian security forces during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also accuses the Namibian government of failing to uphold its constitutional obligation to inform detainees of the reasons for their arrest and to bring them before a magistrate within 48 hours. Many of these injustices are said to have been perpetrated against individuals with suspected links to Unita and the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA). 

Shivute dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and unverified, claiming that it is a mere reproduction of wrongful and unsubstantiated accounts. He also criticized the moral framing of the report, arguing that the US has committed far more egregious human rights abuses, particularly in the context of the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan, where "enemies" of the state were detained without trial. 

Shivute further pointed out a confusion of historical data in the report, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the relationship between the Swapo Party and the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW).
