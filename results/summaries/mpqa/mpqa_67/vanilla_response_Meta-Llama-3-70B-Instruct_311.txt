SUMMARY:

The Namibian government has dismissed a US report on human rights violations in the country, citing the US government's own human rights abuses. The US report accused Namibian security forces of extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi regions. However, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute responded that the US government was the worst human rights violator in the world, pointing to the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute also disputed the accuracy of the report, claiming it contained factual inaccuracies and unverified information. He specifically mentioned the report's error in stating that the ruling party's publication, Namibia Today, was a government-owned magazine. The government has attached "little value" to the report, which Shivute believes is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports".
