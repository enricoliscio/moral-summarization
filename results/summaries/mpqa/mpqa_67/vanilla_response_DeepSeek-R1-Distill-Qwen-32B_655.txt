Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various human rights violations, like extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The government, through Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute, responds by criticizing the US for being hypocritical, pointing out their own issues like Guantanamo Bay detentions.

I should note the key points: the US report's allegations, Shivute's rebuttal, the specific violations mentioned, and the government's dismissal of the report as inaccurate. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures all main elements without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating the government's dismissal of the report. Then mention the allegations from the US. Next, include Shivute's criticism of the US's own human rights record. Finally, highlight the government's stance on the report's inaccuracies and their rejection of it.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly. Also, I need to avoid any markdown and just provide a clear, straightforward summary.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accused Namibia's security forces of numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The report, released this week, detailed abuses committed by the Special Field Force (SFF) in 2001, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi regions, and accused the government of failing to adhere to its own constitution regarding detention procedures. Shivute rejected the report as inaccurate and misleading, pointing out factual errors, such as misclassifying Namibia Today as a government-owned publication and confusing historical data about the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW). The government dismissed the report as a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports." END OF SUMMARY.
