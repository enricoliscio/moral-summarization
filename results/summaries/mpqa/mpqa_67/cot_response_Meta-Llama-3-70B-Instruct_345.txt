SUMMARY:
The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that lists several human rights violations committed by security forces and the government. The report cites cases of extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests, particularly in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. The government has responded by accusing the US of being the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The government claims that the report contains factual inaccuracies and is a "mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports". However, the report highlights the government's failure to account for the whereabouts of detained persons and the use of torture and cruel treatment by security forces. The government's dismissal of the report raises questions about its commitment to upholding human rights and preventing further abuses.
