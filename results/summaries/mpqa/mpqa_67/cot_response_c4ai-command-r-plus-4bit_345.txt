SUMMARY: 
Namibia's government strongly refutes a US human rights report alleging various injustices committed by its security forces and government. The report accuses Namibian authorities of extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, disappearances, torture, and other inhumane acts during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions in 2001. It also highlights arbitrary arrests and denials of fair trials, with many detained on suspicious links to rebel groups. However, the Information Permanent Secretary, Mocks Shivute, counters by pointing out the US's own human rights violations, such as the detention of 300 people without trial at Guantanamo Bay. Shivute also criticizes the report for its inaccuracies and failure to verify allegations, arguing that Namibia places little value on such biased and unsubstantiated reports. He questions the moral high ground of the US, citing their post-9/11 actions and the war in Afghanistan, and challenges the credibility of the report by pointing out factual errors and confusion. The Namibian government's response highlights its commitment to upholding human rights and due process, while also calling for accountability and ethical standards in global human rights reporting.
