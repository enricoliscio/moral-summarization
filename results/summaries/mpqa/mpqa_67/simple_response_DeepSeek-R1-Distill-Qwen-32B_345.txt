Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. The report accuses Namibia's security forces of various violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and more. The government responds by pointing out the US's own human rights issues, like Guantanamo Bay detentions without trial.

I should highlight the key points: the report's allegations, the government's dismissal, and their counter-arguments. I need to keep the moral angle, showing both sides' criticisms.

I'll start by stating the government dismissed the report. Then mention the specific violations cited. Next, include Shivute's response, comparing US actions. Also, note the inaccuracies the government found in the report.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it to flow logically, ensuring each main point is covered without getting too detailed.

Okay, putting it all together now, making sure the summary is clear and preserves the moral framing from both perspectives.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accused its security forces of committing human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances. The report, which cited the Special Field Force (SFF) as perpetrating most abuses, also criticized Namibia for failing to adhere to its constitutional provisions regarding arrests and detentions. In response, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, pointing to its own human rights violations, such as detaining individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. Shivute dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and misleading, claiming it contained errors, such as misrepresenting the ownership of media outlets and historical data about labor unions. He argued that the US's actions, including those during the September 11 attacks and the Afghan war, raised questions about the objectivity of its human rights critiques. The government thus attached "little value" to the report, emphasizing its lack of credibility. END OF SUMMARY.
