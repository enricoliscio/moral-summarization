SUMMARY: A US human rights report has listed several human rights violations committed by Namibian security forces and the government, including extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The report also mentions that some detainees were not brought before a magistrate within the required 48-hour period and that many arrests were based on suspected links to rebel groups. In response, the Namibian government dismissed the report, stating that the US is the worst human rights violator, citing the detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The Namibian government also criticized the report for factual inaccuracies and unverified information, such as confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers. The government asserted that the report carried little value and was a mere reproduction of unverified claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
