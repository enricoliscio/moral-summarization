Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the Namibian government dismissing a US human rights report. They're criticizing the US for its own human rights issues, like Guantanamo Bay. I should highlight both sides: the US report's claims and the government's response.

First, I'll note the main points: the report accuses Namibia's security forces of human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The government counters by pointing out the US's hypocrisy, citing Guantanamo. I should mention that the report lists specific abuses and the government's dismissal of inaccuracies.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the government's dismissal, then the report's allegations, followed by the government's counterarguments. I'll ensure the moral angle is clearâ€”Namibia accusing the US of the same issues they're being criticized for.

Also, I should include that the government called the report inaccurate and confused, like the affiliation of NUNW. I'll make sure to mention that the report was released this week and the regions affected, Kavango and Caprivi.

Let me piece it together: Start with the dismissal, then the report's claims, the government's counter with Guantanamo, the specific issues in the report, and the government's dismissal of inaccuracies. Keep each sentence tight and to the point without losing the moral comparison.

SUMMARY: The Namibian government has dismissed a US human rights report that accuses security forces and the government of human rights violations, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute criticized the US for hypocrisy, citing its detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay without trial. The report, released this week, highlights abuses in the Kavango and Caprivi regions, including disappearances and lack of accountability for detained individuals. Shivute argued that similar actions by the US, such as detaining prisoners in special camps during the Afghanistan war, should not be exempt from criticism. He dismissed the report as factually inaccurate and misleading, pointing out errors like mislabeling Namibia Today as a government-owned publication and confusing the affiliation of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW). The government, he said, attaches little value to the report due to its inaccuracies. END OF SUMMARY.
