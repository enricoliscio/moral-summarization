SUMMARY: The Namibian government has strongly refuted a US human rights report that documents a number of human rights abuses by Namibian security forces and the Government, calling it inaccurate and unverified. The report alleges extra-judicial killings, deaths in custody, torture, and arbitrary arrests by Namibian security forces during operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions. It also claims that the Namibian Government has failed to uphold constitutional rights by not informing detainees of the reasons for their arrest and denying them a fair and public hearing within 48 hours. 

In response, Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute pointed out the hypocrisy of the US in criticizing human rights when it itself has committed well-documented human rights violations, such as the detention of 300 people at Guantanamo Bay without trial, and the construction of special camps to detain "enemies of the state" following the September 11 attacks. Shivute also refuted specific claims in the report, such as the allegation that the ruling party publication Namibia Today is government-owned, and questioned the report's accuracy and objectivity.
