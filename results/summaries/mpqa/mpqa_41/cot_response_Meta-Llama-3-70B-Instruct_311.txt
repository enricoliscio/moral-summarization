SUMMARY:
The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal protection and promotion of human rights. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed in tandem. They warned that globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world, hampering the ability to exercise human rights, and widening the development gap between countries. The international community must prioritize promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy to truly win the war against terrorism. There can be no compromise or lapse in vigilance in protecting human rights.
