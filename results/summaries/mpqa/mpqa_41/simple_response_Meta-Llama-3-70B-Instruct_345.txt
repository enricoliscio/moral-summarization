SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection. Delegations stressed that human rights and development are intertwined, and people must be at the center of social and economic development efforts. Globalization is threatening to marginalize the developing world and hinder the exercise of human rights. Narrowing the development gap between countries is essential for realizing universal human rights. The international community must prioritize human rights protection to truly win the war against terrorism. Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is an integral part of the multilateral war on terrorism.
