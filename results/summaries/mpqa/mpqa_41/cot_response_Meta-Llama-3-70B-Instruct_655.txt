SUMMARY:
The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for the universal protection and promotion of human rights. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed in tandem. They also warned that globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world and hamper the ability to exercise human rights. The committee highlighted the need to narrow the development gap between countries to realize universal human rights. The representatives also emphasized the importance of promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy in the war against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
