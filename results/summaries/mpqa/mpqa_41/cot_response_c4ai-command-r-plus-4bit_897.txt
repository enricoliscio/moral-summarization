SUMMARY: The delegations at the UN General Assembly's Third Committee stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. They identified two preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights: the right to development and maintaining international peace and security. Several representatives emphasized that human rights and development are interconnected and should be tackled together, with people at the heart of social and economic development efforts. The negative impact of globalization on the ability to exercise rights and duties, especially in the developing world, was highlighted. The widening development gap between countries was recognized as an impediment to universal human rights. The importance of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism was also underscored, with the representative from the United States advocating for the promotion and strengthening of human rights and democracy as integral to the multilateral war on terrorism. The debate underscored the moral imperative to address the suffering and deprivation that hinder the enjoyment of human rights, with a focus on development, peace, security, and the protection and promotion of rights.
