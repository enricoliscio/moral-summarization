SUMMARY: At the UN General Assembly's Third Committee meeting, delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people lacking development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. The representatives of Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the United States emphasized the interconnectedness of human rights and development, the negative impact of globalization, the need to narrow the development gap, and the importance of safeguarding human rights in the fight against terrorism. Speakers also addressed issues such as disease, drug abuse, armed conflicts, terrorism, transnational organized crime, and the marginalization of the developing world. The committee's debate underscored the importance of promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide as an integral part of the multilateral effort to combat terrorism. The delegations of Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also contributed to the discussion.
