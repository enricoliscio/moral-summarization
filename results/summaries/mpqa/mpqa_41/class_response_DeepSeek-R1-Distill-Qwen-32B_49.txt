Okay, I need to summarize this UN news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about a debate in the UN's Third Committee discussing human rights, particularly how development and peace are crucial for human rights. 

First, I'll identify the key points. Delegations emphasized that without development, people can't enjoy their rights. They mentioned suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health. The right to development and international peace are preconditions for human rights. Thailand's rep said human rights and development are two sides of the same coin. Eritrea and China talked about globalization marginalizing the developing world and hindering their rights. Shen Guofang from China pointed out that underdevelopment hinders protecting human rights. The US rep linked protecting human rights to fighting terrorism, saying it's integral to the war on terror. Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, etc., also spoke. The committee will meet again.

Now, I need to use the morally framed words: suffering, hunger, improving, enjoyment, protection, efforts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, hindered, protect, deteriorating, horrors, attack, truly, protected, lapse, strengthening.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with the main idea: Delegations stressed that without development and peace, people can't enjoy rights. Mention suffering from poverty, hunger, etc. Include Thailand's point about rights and development. Eritrea and China's concerns about globalization marginalizing and hindering rights. Shen's point on underdevelopment. US linking human rights protection to fighting terrorism. End with the committee meeting again.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many moral words as possible. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral terms.
