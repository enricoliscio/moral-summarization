SUMMARY: At the 56th UN General Assembly, delegations stressed the intrinsic link between development and human rights. They argued that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. The representative of Thailand stated that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin. Eritrea's representative expressed concerns about the marginalization of the developing world due to globalization, hindering the exercise of rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments. China's representative, Shen Guofang, emphasized the need to narrow the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The United States representative also stressed the importance of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism. Other representatives, including those from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia, contributed to the debate. The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions. END OF SUMMARY.
