SUMMARY: Several delegations at the Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized the link between development and human rights. They argued that people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. The representative from Thailand stated that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together. The representative from Eritrea expressed concerns about how globalization is marginalizing the developing world and hindering the exercise of rights enshrined in international human rights instruments. China's representative stressed the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for realizing universal human rights. The US representative emphasized that protecting human rights is integral to winning the war against terrorism. Other representatives, including those from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia, also contributed to the debate. The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions.
