SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN Third Committee that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. Representatives emphasized that the right to development is crucial for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. They also highlighted the importance of maintaining international peace and security. 

The delegate from Thailand stated that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from Eritrea expressed concerns about globalization, stating that it threatens to marginalize the developing world and hinder the exercise of rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the right to development. 

China's representative, Shen Guofang, emphasized the need to narrow the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The impact of underdevelopment on the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights was also highlighted. 

The United States delegate acknowledged the horrors of terrorist attacks and emphasized that protecting human rights is essential to truly winning the war against terrorism. 

The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions, with representatives committed to promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide as an integral part of the multilateral effort.
