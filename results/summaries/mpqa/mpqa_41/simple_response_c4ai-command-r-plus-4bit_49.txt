SUMMARY: Several delegations to the United Nations' Third Committee stressed that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The committee opened a debate on human rights questions, including alternative approaches to improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Representatives emphasized that the right to development and maintaining international peace and security are two crucial preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. The representative of Thailand stated that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative of Eritrea expressed concern that globalization is marginalizing the developing world and impeding the ability to exercise rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the right to development. China's representative, Shen Guofang, highlighted the crucial need to narrow the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The United States delegate added that protecting human rights is essential to winning the war against terrorism. Other representatives, including those from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia, also contributed to the debate.
