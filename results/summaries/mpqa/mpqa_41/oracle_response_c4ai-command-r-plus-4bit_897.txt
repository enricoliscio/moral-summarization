SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN General Assembly that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were identified as the two crucial preconditions for ensuring the universal protection and promotion of human rights. 

The representatives of Thailand and Eritrea emphasized the interconnectedness of human rights and development, highlighting the need to address both issues simultaneously while placing people at the center of social and economic development efforts. They also underscored the importance of protecting individuals from scourges such as disease, narcotic drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. 

China's representative, Shen Guofang, pointed out that narrowing the development gap between countries is crucial for realizing universal human rights, as underdevelopment severely hinders the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. 

The United States representative asserted that protecting human rights is integral to winning the war against terrorism, emphasizing the need for vigilance, promotion, and strengthening of human rights and democracy worldwide. 

The committee will continue its debate on human rights questions, with representatives addressing a range of concerns and approaches to improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
