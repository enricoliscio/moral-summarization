SUMMARY:
The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed together. They also highlighted the need to protect people from scourges like disease, narcotic drugs, and terrorism. The committee warned that globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world and hinder the ability to exercise human rights. Narrowing the development gap between countries is crucial to realizing universal human rights. The committee will continue its debate on human rights questions, emphasizing the importance of promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
