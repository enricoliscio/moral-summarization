Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a UN General Assembly meeting where several countries discussed human rights. Delegations emphasized that without development, people can't fully enjoy their rights. They mentioned issues like poverty, hunger, and poor health as barriers to human rights.

The right to development is a key precondition for human rights, along with international peace. Thailand's representative said human rights and development are two sides of the same coin. They also talked about protecting people from diseases, drugs, conflicts, terrorism, and crime.

Eritrea's delegate pointed out that globalization is marginalizing developing countries and hindering their ability to exercise human rights. China's representative, Shen Guofang, stressed that underdevelopment hinders human rights protection and that the situation for poor countries is worsening with globalization.

The U.S. representative linked human rights protection to fighting terrorism, saying it's crucial for winning the war against terrorism. Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also spoke in the debate.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: suffering, hunger, improving, enjoyment, protection, efforts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, hindered, protect, deteriorating, horrors, attack, truly, protected, lapse, strengthening.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the link between development and human rights, the role of peace, Thailand's point, the impact of globalization, China's statement, the U.S. on terrorism, and the ongoing debate.

Let me make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral terms.
