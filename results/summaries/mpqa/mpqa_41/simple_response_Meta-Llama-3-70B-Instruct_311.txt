SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection. Representatives from various countries stressed that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together. They warned that globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world and hinder the exercise of human rights. Underdevelopment has seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. The international community was urged to prioritize human rights protection, as it is an integral part of the war against terrorism. The committee emphasized that people should be at the center of social and economic development efforts, protected from scourges such as disease, narcotic drugs, and terrorism.
