Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the UN General Assembly's debate on human rights. Let me read through the article first to get a good understanding.

The article mentions that several delegations at the UN stressed that people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health can't fully enjoy their human rights. They're talking about the right to development as a key precondition for human rights. The committee is discussing how to improve the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Thailand's representative said that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed together. They also mentioned that people should be at the center of development efforts and need protection from issues like disease, drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism, etc.

Eritrea's representative pointed out that globalization is marginalizing developing countries and hindering their ability to exercise human rights. China's Shen Guofang emphasized that narrowing the development gap is crucial for universal human rights, and underdevelopment is a big obstacle for developing countries. He also noted that globalization is making things worse for poor countries.

The US representative said that protecting human rights is essential in the fight against terrorism. They believe promoting human rights and democracy is part of the multilateral approach against terrorism.

Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also spoke in the debate. The committee will meet again the next day to continue the discussion.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the importance of development for human rights, the role of globalization, the need for addressing human rights and development together, and the various countries' perspectives.

I should structure it to include the key points from each delegation and the overall debate's focus. I need to make sure it's concise but covers all the essential elements without getting too detailed.

Let me start by outlining the main ideas:

1. UN debate on human rights, emphasizing development and peace as preconditions.
2. Thailand: Human rights and development are interconnected.
3. Eritrea and China: Globalization's negative impact on developing countries and human rights.
4. US: Importance of human rights in combating terrorism.
5. Other countries participated, and the debate continues.

Now, I'll craft a summary that flows logically, starting with the debate's focus, then the key points from each country, and conclude with the continuation of the debate.

I should ensure that each sentence is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, I need to stay within the word limit, so I'll keep each point brief.

Let me check the word count as I go to make sure it doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll aim for around 150-180 words to be safe.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure to include all the main points without being too verbose.
