SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN General Assembly's Third Committee that it is unrealistic to expect people struggling with a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully exercise their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. The representatives of Thailand and Eritrea emphasized the interconnectedness of human rights and development, noting that people should be at the center of social and economic development efforts, protected from scourges like disease, drug abuse, armed conflict, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. The Chinese representative, Shen Guofang, pointed out the widening development gap between countries as an impediment to universal human rights realization, with underdevelopment severely hindering developing countries' capacity to protect and promote human rights. The rapid spread of globalization and economic expansion were worsening the situation for poor countries daily. The US representative underscored that protecting human rights is essential to winning the war on terrorism, promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide as integral to the multilateral effort. The delegations of Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also participated in the debate, emphasizing the importance of human rights in the context of development and peace.
