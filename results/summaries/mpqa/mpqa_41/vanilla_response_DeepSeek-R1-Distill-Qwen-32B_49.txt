Alright, I need to summarize this UN news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a debate in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. They're discussing human rights, particularly focusing on development and peace as key factors. Delegations from various countries, like Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the US, are speaking. Each country's representative is making points about how development and peace are necessary for human rights. For example, Thailand's rep says development and rights go hand in hand. Eritrea and China mention how globalization affects developing countries negatively. The US rep talks about the importance of human rights in fighting terrorism. I should capture the main points: the debate's focus, key speakers, their main arguments, and the committee's next steps. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include all the main countries mentioned and their viewpoints. Also, mention that the debate will continue the next day. I'll structure it to first introduce the debate, then the main arguments from each country, and conclude with the committee's next meeting. Need to ensure clarity and that all key points are covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
At the UN General Assembly's Third Committee, delegates emphasized that without addressing development, poverty, hunger, and health issues, people cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The debate focused on the right to development and international peace as critical for human rights protection. Thailand highlighted that development and human rights are interconnected, while Eritrea and China warned that globalization risks marginalizing developing nations and widening the development gap, hindering human rights. The U.S. stressed that protecting human rights is essential in the fight against terrorism. Representatives from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also contributed to the discussion. The committee will continue its debate on human rights the following day.
