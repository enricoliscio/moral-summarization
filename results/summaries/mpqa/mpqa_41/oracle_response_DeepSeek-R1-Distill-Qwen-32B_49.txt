Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the UN General Assembly's Third Committee debate on human rights. Delegations emphasized that without development, people can't fully enjoy their rights. They mentioned the right to development and international peace as crucial. Thailand's rep said human rights and development are linked. Eritrea's rep pointed out globalization's negative impact on developing countries. China's delegate, Shen Guofang, highlighted the development gap and underdevelopment's hindrance to human rights. The U.S. rep linked protecting human rights to fighting terrorism. Other countries also spoke, and the debate continues.

I need to use as many of the morally framed words as possible: enjoy, improving, enjoyment, freedoms, ensure, protection, promotion, peace, security, rights, addressed, protected, conflicts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, duties, narrowing, realization, protect, promote, attack, expediency, compromise, lapse, promoting, strengthening.

I'll start by mentioning the debate's focus on human rights and the preconditions like development and peace. Then, include Thailand's point about the two sides, Eritrea and China's concerns about globalization and development gaps. Highlight the U.S.'s stance on human rights and terrorism. Conclude with the ongoing debate.

I should structure the summary to include all these points concisely, using the moral terms where appropriate. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.
