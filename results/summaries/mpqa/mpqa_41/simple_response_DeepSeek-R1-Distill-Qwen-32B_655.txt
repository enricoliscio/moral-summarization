Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a UN General Assembly debate on human rights, focusing on development, peace, and the impact of globalization.

First, I'll identify the key points. Several countries emphasized that without development, people can't enjoy human rights. The right to development and international peace are crucial. Thailand mentioned that human rights and development are linked. Eritrea and China talked about globalization widening the gap and hindering rights. The US stressed that protecting human rights is essential in fighting terrorism.

I need to condense these points into a concise summary. I'll start by stating the debate's focus on human rights, then mention the main arguments from each delegation. I'll ensure the moral aspects, like the necessity of addressing development and peace, are highlighted.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows logically. I'll include the key points from each country and the overall message about the interconnectedness of human rights with development and peace.
