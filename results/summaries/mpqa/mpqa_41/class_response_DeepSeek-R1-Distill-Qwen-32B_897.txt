Alright, I need to summarize this UN news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses a UN General Assembly meeting where delegates emphasized that without development, people can't fully enjoy their rights. They mentioned issues like poverty, hunger, and poor health as barriers to human rights. The right to development is a key precondition for human rights protection. They also talked about international peace and security as another crucial element. Thailand's representative linked human rights and development, saying they should be addressed together. Eritrea's delegate pointed out that globalization is marginalizing developing countries and hindering their rights. China's representative highlighted the development gap as crucial for universal rights and how underdevelopment hinders progress. The U.S. delegate linked protecting human rights to fighting terrorism effectively. Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, and Japan also spoke.

I need to include as many morally framed words as possible. Words like suffering, hunger, improving, enjoyment, protection, efforts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, hindered, protect, deteriorating, horrors, attack, truly, protected, lapse, strengthening.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the importance of development and peace for human rights, the impact of globalization, and the link between human rights and fighting terrorism. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the urgency and the issues discussed.

Let me draft the summary, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll start by stating the main issue, then mention the key points from each delegation, and conclude with the ongoing debate.
