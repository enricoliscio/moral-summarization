SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly has begun debating human rights questions, emphasizing that poverty, hunger, and poor health hinder the full enjoyment of human rights. Delegations stressed that the right to development and international peace and security are crucial preconditions for protecting and promoting human rights. Representatives from various countries, including Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the US, highlighted the importance of addressing development and human rights simultaneously. They warned that globalization and economic expansion are exacerbating the situation for poor countries, making it difficult for them to protect and promote human rights. The US representative emphasized that protecting human rights is essential to winning the war against terrorism. The committee will continue its debate on Thursday.
