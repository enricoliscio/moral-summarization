Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about a UN General Assembly debate where several countries discussed human rights. They emphasized that without development, people can't enjoy their rights. Words like "suffering," "hunger," and "protection" are used to highlight the moral issues. 

I should note that the right to development and international peace are key. Thailand's representative mentioned that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin. That's an important moral point.

Eritrea and China pointed out how globalization is marginalizing developing countries and hindering their ability to exercise rights. This uses words like "marginalize" and "hampering," which are morally charged. 

The US representative linked protecting human rights to fighting terrorism, using terms like "horrors" and "attack." They stressed that human rights are non-negotiable in the fight against terrorism.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words and captures the essence of each country's argument. Also, keep it under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it by mentioning the debate, the key points from Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the US, using the specified moral terms. I'll ensure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.
