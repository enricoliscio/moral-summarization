SUMMARY: At the 56th UN General Assembly, delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as the two crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. Speakers emphasized that human rights and development are intertwined and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from Eritrea warned that globalization threatens to marginalize the developing world further and impede the exercise of rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the right to development. China's representative, Shen Guofang, underscored the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights, acknowledging that underdevelopment has hindered developing countries' capacity to protect and promote human rights. The United States delegate added that protecting human rights is integral to winning the war against terrorism. Speakers from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also contributed to the debate. The committee will reconvene to continue discussing human rights questions.
