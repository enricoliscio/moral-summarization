SUMMARY: In a recent discussion at the UN General Assembly, delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. Representatives highlighted the right to development and maintaining international peace and security as the two crucial preconditions for ensuring the universal protection and promotion of human rights. They emphasized the interconnectedness of human rights and development, stating that people should be at the center of social and economic development efforts, protected from scourges like disease, drug abuse, armed conflicts, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. The negative impact of globalization on the ability of developing countries to exercise their rights and duties, including the right to development, was also addressed. The representative from China, Shen Guofang, highlighted the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The discussion also touched upon the role of human rights protection in the war against terrorism, with the US representative emphasizing the integral role of promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy in this fight. The delegations from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also contributed to the debate.
