SUMMARY: Several delegations at the UN Third Committee stressed that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The committee debated human rights questions, including the right to development and maintaining international peace and security as crucial preconditions for the universal protection and promotion of human rights. Speakers emphasized that human rights and development are intertwined and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from Eritrea warned that globalization threatens to marginalize the developing world and hinder the ability to exercise rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the right to development. China's representative, Shen Guofang, highlighted the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The United States delegate added that protecting human rights is essential to winning the war against terrorism. The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions, with speakers promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy as integral to the multilateral efforts.
