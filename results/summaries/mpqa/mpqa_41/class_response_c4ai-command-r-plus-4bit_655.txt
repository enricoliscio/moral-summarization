SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN General Assembly's Third Committee that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. They asserted that the right to development is crucial for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights, along with maintaining international peace and security. The representative from Thailand highlighted the interconnectedness of human rights and development, emphasizing the need to address both simultaneously while placing people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The impact of globalization was also discussed, with the representative from Eritrea expressing concerns about its potential to further marginalize the developing world and impede the exercise of rights enshrined in international human rights instruments. China's representative, Shen Guofang, underscored the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The United States delegate added that protecting human rights is essential to truly winning the war against terrorism. Other representatives from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also contributed to the debate, emphasizing the importance of improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
