SUMMARY: 

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for the universal protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed in tandem. People must be protected from scourges like disease, narcotic drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. Globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world, hampering the ability to exercise human rights, including the right to development. Narrowing the development gap between countries is crucial for the realization of universal human rights. The international community must prioritize human rights protection to truly win the war against terrorism, with no expediency, compromise, or lapse in vigilance. Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is essential for a multilateral war on terrorism.
