SUMMARY: At the 56th UN General Assembly, delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. Representatives emphasized that the right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. The relationship between human rights and development was highlighted, with the need to address both in tandem to ensure people are at the center of social and economic development efforts. The negative impact of globalization on the ability of developing countries to exercise rights and duties, including the right to development, was discussed. The narrowing of the development gap between countries was recognized as essential for universal human rights realization. The representative from China, Shen Guofang, stated that underdevelopment hinders the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. The ongoing threat of terrorism and the need to protect human rights as a crucial part of the multilateral war on terrorism were also addressed. Representatives from various countries participated in the debate, highlighting the importance of improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
