SUMMARY: The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly discussed the crucial link between development and human rights. Several delegations stressed that people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as two preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. It was emphasized that human rights and development are intertwined and should be addressed together, with people at the center. The negative impact of globalization on the ability of developing countries to exercise their rights and duties was also discussed. The representative from China highlighted the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for the realization of universal human rights. The deteriorating situation in poor countries due to globalization and economic expansion was also mentioned. The United States representative underscored the need to protect human rights in the fight against terrorism, stating that promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy are integral to the multilateral war on terrorism. The discussions emphasized the moral imperative of addressing development and human rights issues simultaneously to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. END OF SUMMARY.
