Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the UN debate on human rights. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly discussing human rights. Several countries emphasized that without development, people can't fully enjoy their rights. They mentioned issues like poverty, hunger, and poor health as barriers to human rights.

Thailand's representative said human rights and development are two sides of the same coin, meaning they should be addressed together. They also stressed that people should be at the center of development efforts and protected from issues like diseases, drugs, conflicts, terrorism, etc.

Eritrea's delegate pointed out that globalization is marginalizing developing countries and affecting their ability to exercise human rights. China's Shen Guofang said the development gap is crucial for universal human rights and that underdevelopment hinders protecting rights in poor countries. He also noted that globalization is worsening the situation for poor countries.

The US representative mentioned that protecting human rights is essential in the fight against terrorism. They can't win the war on terrorism without safeguarding rights. Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, Japan, etc., also spoke in the debate. The committee will meet again the next day.

So, the summary should include the key points: the debate's focus on human rights and development, the role of development as a precondition, the impact of globalization, the US's stance on terrorism and rights, and the continuation of the debate.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without getting too detailed. I should use clear and direct language, avoiding jargon. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the main topic, then the key points from each country, and end with the continuation of the debate.
