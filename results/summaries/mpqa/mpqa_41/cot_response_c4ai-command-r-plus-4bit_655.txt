SUMMARY: The delegations at the 56th UN General Assembly highlighted the importance of addressing the issues of suffering, underdevelopment, poverty, hunger, and poor health to ensure the effective enjoyment of human rights. They emphasized that the right to development and maintaining peace and security are crucial preconditions for the universal protection and promotion of human rights. The representative from Thailand stressed that human rights and development are interconnected and should be tackled together, with people at the center. The impact of globalization was discussed, with concerns raised about its potential to further marginalize developing nations and hinder the realization of rights such as the right to development. The widening development gap between countries was identified as an impediment to universal human rights. The assembly also acknowledged the ongoing war on terrorism and the integral role of human rights protection in winning it. The representatives of several countries contributed to the debate, expressing their views on the importance of addressing human rights issues. The assembly will reconvene to further discuss human rights questions. END OF SUMMARY.
