Representatives argued that the right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for ensuring universal protection and promotion of human rights. The representative from Thailand stated that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from Eritrea expressed concerns about globalization further marginalizing the developing world and impeding the exercise of rights enshrined in international human rights instruments. China's representative emphasized the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for realizing universal human rights. The United States representative highlighted the importance of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism. Other speakers included representatives from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia. The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions.
