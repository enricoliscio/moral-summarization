SUMMARY:

The UN's Third Committee emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection and promotion. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are intertwined and must be addressed together. They warned that globalization is threatening to further marginalize the developing world, alienate its masses, and hinder the exercise of human rights. Underdevelopment has seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. The situation for poor countries is deteriorating daily. The international community must prioritize human rights protection to truly win the war against terrorism. There can be no compromise or lapse in vigilance. Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is integral to the multilateral war on terrorism.
