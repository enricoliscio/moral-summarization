Alright, I need to summarize this UN news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The main issue is that human rights can't be fully enjoyed without development, which ties into poverty, hunger, and health. Several countries emphasized this, like Thailand, Eritrea, and China. They argue that development and human rights are interconnected. 

The article mentions the Third Committee's debate on human rights, focusing on how development and international peace are crucial. Thailand's rep says they're two sides of the same coin. Eritrea and China talk about globalization widening the gap and hindering rights. The US representative links human rights protection to the fight against terrorism, saying it's integral to the war on terror. 

I should highlight the connection between development and human rights, the role of globalization in marginalizing developing countries, and the US's stance on human rights in counter-terrorism. Also, note that the debate continues the next day. 

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. Make sure to mention the key countries and their arguments, the committee's focus, and the ongoing debate. I need to preserve the moral framing, so emphasize the necessity of development for human rights and the global challenges they face.

SUMMARY: At the UN General Assembly's Third Committee, delegates emphasized that human rights cannot be fully realized without addressing development, poverty, hunger, and poor health. The right to development was identified as a key precondition for universal human rights protection. Thailand's representative highlighted the interconnectedness of human rights and development, stating they are "two sides of the same coin." Eritrea and China warned that globalization risks marginalizing developing countries and hindering their ability to exercise human rights, particularly the right to development. China's representative Shen Guofang stressed that underdevelopment has severely limited the capacity of developing nations to protect human rights. The United States emphasized that protecting human rights is essential to winning the fight against terrorism, stating that human rights promotion and democracy are integral to the global counter-terrorism effort. The debate continued, with representatives from multiple countries addressing these issues. END OF SUMMARY.
