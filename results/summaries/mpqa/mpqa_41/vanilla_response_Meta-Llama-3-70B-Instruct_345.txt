SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly has begun debating human rights questions, with a focus on alternative approaches to improve the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Many delegations stressed that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection. Representatives from various countries, including Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the US, emphasized the importance of addressing human rights and development simultaneously. They warned that globalization and economic expansion are exacerbating the situation for poor countries, and that promoting human rights and democracy is essential to winning the war against terrorism. The committee will continue its debate on Thursday.
