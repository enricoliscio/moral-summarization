SUMMARY:
The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection and promotion. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are two sides of the same coin and should be addressed in tandem. They warned that globalization is threatening to marginalize the developing world, and underdevelopment has seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. The international community must prioritize human rights protection and promotion to truly win the war against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
