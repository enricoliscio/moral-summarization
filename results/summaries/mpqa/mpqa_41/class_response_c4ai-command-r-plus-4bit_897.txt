SUMMARY: At the UN General Assembly's Third Committee meeting, delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security were highlighted as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. Speakers emphasized that human rights and development are interconnected and should be tackled together. People should be at the heart of social and economic development efforts, protected from scourges like disease, drug abuse, armed conflict, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. Globalization was criticized for marginalizing the developing world and impeding the exercise of rights enshrined in international human rights instruments. Representatives from various countries, including China and Eritrea, stressed the importance of narrowing the development gap between countries for realizing universal human rights. The deteriorating situation in poor countries due to globalization and economic expansion was also addressed. The representative from the United States asserted that protecting human rights is essential to truly winning the war against terrorism. Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is integral to the multilateral fight against terrorism. The committee will continue its general debate on human rights questions.
