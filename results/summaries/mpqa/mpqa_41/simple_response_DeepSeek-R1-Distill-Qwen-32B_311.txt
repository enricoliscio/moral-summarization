Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about a UN General Assembly meeting where several countries discussed human rights, particularly focusing on how development and peace are crucial for human rights. Delegations like Thailand, Eritrea, China, and the US made statements.

I should note the key points: the right to development is a precondition for human rights, the importance of international peace, how globalization affects developing countries, and the US's stance on human rights in the context of fighting terrorism.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements and the moral arguments each country presented. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary: start with the UN debate, mention the main points about development and peace, then touch on each country's perspective briefly, and conclude with the ongoing debate.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like how underdevelopment hinders human rights and how terrorism relates to protecting rights.

Alright, putting it all together now.

The debate, involving countries like Cuba, Egypt, and Japan, continued with a focus on integrating human rights, development, and peace. END OF SUMMARY.
