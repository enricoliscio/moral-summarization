Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a UN debate on human rights, focusing on development, peace, and the impact of globalization.

First, I'll identify the main points. Delegations emphasized that without development, people can't enjoy human rights. They mentioned the right to development and international peace as crucial. Thailand's representative linked development and human rights. Eritrea and China talked about globalization widening gaps and hindering rights. The US stressed protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism.

I should highlight the moral arguments: human rights depend on development and peace, and globalization and underdevelopment are barriers. Also, the US's point about human rights in combating terrorism adds another moral angle.

I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to mention each delegation's key points without going over 200 words. I'll ensure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the necessity of addressing development and peace for human rights.
