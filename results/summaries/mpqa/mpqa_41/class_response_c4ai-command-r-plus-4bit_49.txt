SUMMARY: In a recent address to the Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly, several delegations stressed the unrealistic nature of expecting people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. Representatives emphasized the right to development and maintaining international peace and security as the two crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. The delegate from Thailand highlighted the interconnectedness of human rights and development, asserting that they should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from Eritrea expressed concerns about the marginalization and alienation of the developing world due to globalization, which also hampers the exercise of rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the right to development. China's representative, Shen Guofang, pointed out the deteriorating situation in poor countries due to rapid globalization and economic expansion, with underdevelopment severely hindering their capacity to protect and promote human rights. The United States delegate underscored the importance of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism, stating that promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is integral to winning the war on terrorism. The debate also included representatives from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia, all advocating for improved enjoyment, protection, and strengthening of human rights.
