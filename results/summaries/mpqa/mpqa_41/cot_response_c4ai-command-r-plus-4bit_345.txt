SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed at the UN General Assembly that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. They identified development and peace and security as two crucial preconditions for ensuring the universal protection and promotion of human rights. Representatives emphasized that human rights and development are interconnected and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. They further highlighted the importance of protecting people from scourges and social ills such as disease, narcotic drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism, and transnational organized crime. The negative impact of globalization on the developing world was also discussed, with concerns raised about the widening development gap and the hindrance to the exercise of rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments. It was concluded that promoting and strengthening human rights, along with democracy, is integral to the multilateral war on terrorism and ensuring true victory over these horrors. END OF SUMMARY.
