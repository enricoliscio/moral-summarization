Alright, so I need to summarize this UN news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about a UN General Assembly meeting where several delegations discussed human rights. They emphasized that people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health can't fully enjoy their human rights. So, the right to development is crucial. They also mentioned that international peace and security is another key element. Thailand's representative said human rights and development are two sides of the same coin. Eritrea's delegate pointed out that globalization is marginalizing developing countries and hindering their human rights. China's representative, Shen Guofang, highlighted the development gap and how underdevelopment hinders human rights protection. The US representative linked protecting human rights to fighting terrorism. Other countries like Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also spoke. The committee will meet again to continue the debate.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author. They include suffering, hunger, improving, enjoyment, protection, efforts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, hindered, protect, deteriorating, horrors, attack, truly, protected, lapse, strengthening.

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main moral arguments presented.

Let me structure the summary. Start by mentioning the UN meeting and the main points: human rights can't be fully enjoyed without development and peace. Then, include Thailand's point about human rights and development being linked. Next, Eritrea and China's concerns about globalization and underdevelopment. Then, the US's link between human rights and fighting terrorism. Finally, note that the debate continues.

I need to use the moral words like suffering, hunger, improving, protection, terrorism, marginalize, hindered, deteriorating, horrors, attack, protected, strengthening.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering each delegation's main points while preserving the moral framing.
