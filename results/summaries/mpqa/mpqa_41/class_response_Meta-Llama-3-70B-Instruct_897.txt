SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection and promotion. Representatives stressed that human rights and development are intertwined and should be addressed together. They warned that globalization is threatening to marginalize the developing world, alienate its masses, and hamper the exercise of human rights. Underdevelopment has seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights, and the situation for poor countries is deteriorating daily. The international community must prioritize human rights protection to truly win the war against terrorism. Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is essential to combat terrorism. The committee urged efforts to protect people from scourges like disease, narcotic drugs, and organized crime.
