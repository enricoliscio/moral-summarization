SUMMARY:

The Third Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly emphasized that people suffering from poverty, hunger, and poor health cannot fully enjoy their human rights. The right to development and maintaining international peace and security are crucial preconditions for universal human rights protection. Representatives from various countries stressed that human rights and development are intertwined and must be addressed together. They warned that globalization is marginalizing the developing world, hindering the exercise of human rights, and exacerbating poverty. The committee also emphasized that promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy is essential to winning the war against terrorism. The moral imperative is clear: people must be at the center of development efforts, protected from social ills and enabled to exercise their rights and duties. Narrowing the development gap between countries is crucial to realizing universal human rights.
