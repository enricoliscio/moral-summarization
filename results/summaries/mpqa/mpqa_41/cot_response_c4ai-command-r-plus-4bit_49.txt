SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN General Assembly that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. They identified the right to development and maintaining international peace and security as crucial preconditions for ensuring the universal protection and promotion of human rights. Delegates emphasized that human rights and development are intertwined and should be addressed together, with people at the center of social and economic development efforts. They argued that underdevelopment hinders the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights, and the rapid spread of globalization exacerbates this issue. The representative from the United States asserted that the war against terrorism cannot be won without protecting human rights, and promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy worldwide is integral to this fight. The universal realization of human rights was a central theme, with the narrowing of the development gap between countries seen as crucial to achieving this goal. The discussion highlighted the moral imperative to address the challenges of underdevelopment, protect people from social ills, and uphold the rights and duties enshrined in international human rights instruments.
