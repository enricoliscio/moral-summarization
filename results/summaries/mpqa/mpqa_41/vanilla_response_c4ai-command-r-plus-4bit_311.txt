SUMMARY: Several delegations stressed to the UN Third Committee that it is unrealistic to expect people suffering from a lack of development, poverty, hunger, and poor health to fully enjoy their human rights. The committee opened a debate on human rights issues and alternative approaches to improving their effective enjoyment. Representatives emphasized the right to development and maintaining international peace and security as crucial preconditions for ensuring universal human rights protection and promotion. The representatives of Thailand and Eritrea highlighted the interconnection between human rights and development, with Thailand's delegate stating that people should be at the center of social and economic development efforts. The representative from China, Shen Guofang, pointed out that underdevelopment hinders the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights. The US representative emphasized that protecting human rights is essential to winning the war against terrorism. Delegates from Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece, and Indonesia also participated in the debate, which will continue the next day.
