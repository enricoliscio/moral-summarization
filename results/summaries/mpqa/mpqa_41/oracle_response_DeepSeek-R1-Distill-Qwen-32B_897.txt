Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about a UN General Assembly debate where several countries discussed the importance of development and peace for human rights. Delegations emphasized that without addressing issues like poverty and poor health, people can't fully enjoy their rights. They mentioned the right to development and international peace as crucial. Thailand's representative talked about human rights and development being two sides of the same coin. Eritrea and China highlighted how globalization affects developing countries negatively, making it harder for them to protect human rights. The US representative linked human rights protection to the fight against terrorism.

Now, I need to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like enjoy, improving, enjoyment, freedoms, ensure, protection, promotion, peace, security, rights, addressed, protected, conflicts, terrorism, crime, threatening, marginalize, alienate, hampering, duties, narrowing, realization, protect, promote, attack, expediency, compromise, lapse, promoting, strengthening.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the debate's focus on development and peace, the necessity of addressing these to ensure human rights, the role of globalization, and the connection to terrorism. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate.

Let me start by stating the debate's focus on human rights, mentioning the right to development and peace. Then, include how poverty and underdevelopment hinder rights. Highlight Thailand's point about development and rights being linked. Then discuss globalization's negative impact on developing countries, as mentioned by Eritrea and China. Finally, touch on the US's stance on human rights in combating terrorism.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral language is preserved. Let me draft this, making sure each point flows logically and includes the necessary terms.

Eritrea and China warned that globalization risks marginalizing developing countries and hampering their ability to exercise rights, including the right to development. The U.S. stressed that protecting human rights is essential in the fight against terrorism, with no room for expediency or compromise.
