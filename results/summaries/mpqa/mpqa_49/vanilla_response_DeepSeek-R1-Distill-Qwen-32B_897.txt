Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read it carefully.

The article is about President Cardoso of Brazil reacting to the US decision regarding greenhouse gases. He's saying it's positive that the US is taking measures, even though they didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol. He hopes their domestic measures will have the same effect as the protocol.

I should focus on the key points: who, what, where, when. The main elements are Cardoso's positive view, the US measures, and his hope about their effectiveness.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. Also, it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by mentioning Cardoso's statement, his hope, and the implications of the US's actions. Keep it clear and straightforward.
