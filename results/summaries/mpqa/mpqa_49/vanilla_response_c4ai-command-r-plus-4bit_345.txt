SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has reacted positively to the United States' recent decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite their formal decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso acknowledged the importance of the US's role in the convention and expressed hope that their domestic measures will have a similar impact as the Kyoto Protocol in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This response highlights a positive step in the global effort to combat climate change and encourages further cooperation and commitment from all parties involved.
