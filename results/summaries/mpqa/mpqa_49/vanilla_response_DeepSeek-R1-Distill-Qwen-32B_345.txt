Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about President Cardoso of Brazil reacting to the US decision regarding greenhouse gases. He's saying that the US decision is positive even though they didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol. He hopes their domestic measures will have the same effect as the protocol.

I should start by identifying the main points. The key elements are: who (Cardoso), what (reaction to US decision), and the details (positive despite not ratifying Kyoto, hopes measures are effective).

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to mention Cardoso's statement, the US decision, and his hope about the measures.

I should also keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary details. Maybe start with the location and date, then the statement.

Putting it all together, I'll draft a summary that includes all these points succinctly.

END OF SUMMARY.
