SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has hailed the US decision to take action on greenhouse gases as a "positive" move. Despite the US opting not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso is hopeful that the domestic "measures" adopted will have a similar impact. The US is a significant player in the convention, and Cardoso believes that these steps will be beneficial. By "adopting" these measures, the US is taking a crucial step towards mitigating the effects of climate change. Cardoso's optimism stems from the fact that the US is a key party to the convention, and he hopes that these domestic efforts will yield similar results to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. Overall, the Brazilian President views this development as a step in the right direction.
