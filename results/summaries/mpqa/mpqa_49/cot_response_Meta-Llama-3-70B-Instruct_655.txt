STEP 1:
* positive

SUMMARY:
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has hailed the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases as "positive", despite the country's formal decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso expressed hope that the domestic measures taken by the US will have the same effect as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing the importance of the US as a party to the convention. This development is seen as a step in the right direction, and Cardoso's positive assessment suggests that the move is a welcome step towards addressing the critical issue of greenhouse gas emissions.
