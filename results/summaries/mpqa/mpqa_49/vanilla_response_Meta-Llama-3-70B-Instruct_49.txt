SUMMARY:
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed optimism about the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso considers the US an important party to the convention and hopes that the domestic measures will have a similar effect to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This development is seen as a positive step forward in the global effort to address climate change.
