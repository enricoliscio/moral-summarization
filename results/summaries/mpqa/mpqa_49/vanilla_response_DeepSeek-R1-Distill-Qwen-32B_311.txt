Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read it carefully. The article is about President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil commenting on the US's decision regarding greenhouse gases. He says it's positive that the US is taking measures, even though they didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol. He hopes these measures will have the same effect as the protocol.

Hmm, so the main points are: Cardoso's positive view, US not ratifying Kyoto, but taking domestic measures, and his hope that these measures are as effective as the protocol.

I should make sure the summary captures all these points concisely. Let me structure it: start with who, what, where, when. Then include his opinion and the hope for the measures' effectiveness.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I write. Also, the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Wait, the user provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide. They included the location, the person's name, the main points, and the hope. I should follow that structure but make sure it's in my own words.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are included without unnecessary details.
