SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed a positive view on the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is a crucial party to the convention and hopes that the domestically adopted measures will have the same impact as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This statement suggests that Cardoso is optimistic about the US's efforts to address climate change, even if they don't formally ratify the international agreement.
