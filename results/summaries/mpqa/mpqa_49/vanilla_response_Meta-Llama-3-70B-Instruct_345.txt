SUMMARY:
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed a positive view on the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes that the domestic measures taken by the US will have a similar effect to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. He emphasized the importance of the US as a party to the convention, hoping that their actions will contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. Cardoso's statement suggests that he values the US's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even if it doesn't involve formal ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This development may signal a willingness to cooperate on environmental issues, despite differences in approach.
