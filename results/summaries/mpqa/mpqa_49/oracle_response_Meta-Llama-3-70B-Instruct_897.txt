SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has hailed the US decision to take action on greenhouse gases as a "positive" step, despite the country's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso expressed hope that the "measures" adopted domestically by the US would have a similar impact to adhering to the international agreement. By adopting these measures, the US is taking a crucial step towards mitigating the effects of climate change. Cardoso's optimistic tone suggests that even in the absence of formal ratification, the US can still make a significant contribution to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The President's stance emphasizes the importance of collective action in addressing this critical environmental issue. END OF SUMMARY.
