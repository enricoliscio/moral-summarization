SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed optimism regarding the US decision to take measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso views the US as a crucial player in the convention and hopes that the domestic measures adopted will have a similar impact to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This stance highlights the importance of international cooperation in addressing environmental issues, even when countries may not fully commit to global agreements. It also underscores the significance of individual nations taking proactive steps to mitigate their environmental footprint, regardless of their stance on international protocols.
