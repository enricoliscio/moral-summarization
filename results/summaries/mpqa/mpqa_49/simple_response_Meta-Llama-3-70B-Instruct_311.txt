SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed optimism about the US decision to take domestic measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. He believes that the US, as a significant party to the convention, can still make a positive impact through its internal actions. Cardoso hopes that these measures will have a similar effect to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol, implying that the US can still be a responsible global citizen even without formal ratification.

This framing suggests that Cardoso is taking a morally positive stance, encouraging the US to take action on climate change and recognizing the importance of its role in the global effort. By doing so, he is promoting a sense of global responsibility and cooperation in addressing this critical issue.
