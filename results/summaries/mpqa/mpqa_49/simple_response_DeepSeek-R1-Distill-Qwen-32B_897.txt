Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, the user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical implications or the stance the author took.

First, let me read the article again. It's about President Cardoso of Brazil reacting to the US decision regarding greenhouse gases. The US didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol but took measures to control emissions. Cardoso says this is positive and hopes these measures have the same effect as the protocol.

The moral framing here is probably about the US's responsibility and leadership in environmental issues. The author might be highlighting the importance of the US's role even without formally joining the protocol. So, in the summary, I should emphasize that the US's action, though not ratifying the protocol, is still a positive step towards addressing climate change.

I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it with a summary token. Let me try to condense the key points: US didn't ratify Kyoto but took measures, Cardoso approves, hopes for similar impact. Also, note that the US is a significant party in the convention.

I should also mention the moral aspect, like the US's leadership and responsibility in environmental efforts. Maybe phrase it as taking a step in the right direction despite not ratifying the protocol.

Alright, let me put that together concisely, making sure to highlight the positive stance and the moral responsibility.

SUMMARY: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has expressed approval of the United States' decision to implement measures to control greenhouse gases, despite the U.S. not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso emphasized the importance of the U.S. as a key party to the climate convention and expressed hope that its domestic actions would have the same impact as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. The statement underscores the moral responsibility of major powers in addressing global environmental challenges, even in the absence of formal international commitments. END OF SUMMARY.
