SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed a positive outlook on the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso emphasized the importance of the US as a party to the convention, hoping that the domestically adopted measures will have a similar impact to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This development is seen as a step in the right direction, as the US takes positive action to address the pressing issue of greenhouse gases. Cardoso's optimistic stance acknowledges the significance of the US's efforts to mitigate climate change, even if they don't fully comply with the Kyoto Protocol. By adopting these measures, the US is taking a crucial step towards a more sustainable future.
