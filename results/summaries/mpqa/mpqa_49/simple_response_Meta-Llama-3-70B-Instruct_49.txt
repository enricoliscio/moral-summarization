SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed optimism regarding the US decision to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases, despite not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso views the US as a crucial party to the convention and hopes that the domestically adopted measures will have a similar impact to adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This stance reflects a moral framing that emphasizes cooperation and collective responsibility in addressing global environmental issues. By acknowledging the US's importance in the convention, Cardoso underscores the need for international collaboration to combat climate change. His hope for the measures' effectiveness also implies a sense of accountability, where countries are expected to take concrete actions to mitigate their environmental footprint.
