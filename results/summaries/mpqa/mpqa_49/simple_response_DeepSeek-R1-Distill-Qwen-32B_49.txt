Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article carefully.

The article is about President Cardoso's response to the US's decision on greenhouse gases. He says it's positive even though the US didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol. He hopes their domestic measures will have the same effect as the protocol.

I should make sure the summary includes that the US didn't ratify Kyoto but took measures, and Cardoso's positive view. Also, I need to highlight the moral aspect, which is the importance of the US's action despite not joining the protocol.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me draft the summary, making sure to capture all key points and the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has expressed a positive view of the U.S. decision to implement measures to control greenhouse gases, despite the country's formal decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso emphasized the importance of the U.S.'s role in addressing global climate issues, stating that he hopes the domestic actions taken by the U.S. will achieve the same impact as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. This reflects a recognition of the moral responsibility to address environmental concerns, even in the absence of formal international commitments. END OF SUMMARY.
