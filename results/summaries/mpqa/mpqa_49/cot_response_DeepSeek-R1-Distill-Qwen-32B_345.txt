Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with moral framing. They provided an article where President Cardoso comments on the US decision regarding greenhouse gases. First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article mentions "positive," "important," "measures," "control," "greenhouse gases," "formal decision," "ratify," "Kyoto Protocol," "hope," "domestically," "effect," "adhering," and "Kyoto Protocol." These words carry moral weight because they relate to responsibility, cooperation, and positive outcomes in environmental efforts.

Now, I need to summarize the article while keeping these moral terms. The summary should highlight Cardoso's approval of the US's decision, even though they didn't ratify Kyoto. I should mention that the US is a key player and express hope that their domestic measures will have the same impact as the protocol.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the identified words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me structure it to first state Cardoso's approval, then mention the US's importance, and conclude with his hope for effective measures.

I think that covers all the points. Let me put it together smoothly.

**SUMMARY:** President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed approval of the U.S. decision to implement measures to control greenhouse gases, calling it "positive" despite the U.S. not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. He emphasized the U.S.'s importance as a party to the convention and expressed hope that its domestic measures would have the same impact as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
