Cardoso's statement highlights a positive ethical stance on the issue, expressing hope that US domestic measures will have a comparable impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This moral framing emphasizes the potential for unilateral actions to contribute to global environmental efforts, even without formal treaty adherence.
