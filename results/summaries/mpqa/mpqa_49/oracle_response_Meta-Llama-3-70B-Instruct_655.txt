SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has hailed the US decision to control greenhouse gases as a "positive" move, despite the country's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso expressed hope that the "measures" adopted domestically by the US would have the same impact as adhering to the Kyoto Protocol. He emphasized the significance of the US being an "important party" to the convention, implying that their involvement is crucial in addressing the issue. By adopting these measures, the US is taking a step in the right direction, and Cardoso's optimism is a testament to the potential for collective action in mitigating climate change. The president's stance suggests that even partial commitments can be a positive step towards a larger goal.
