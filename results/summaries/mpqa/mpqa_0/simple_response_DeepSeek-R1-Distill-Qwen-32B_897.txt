Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the U.S. State Department's human rights report from 2001, which accuses Iran without evidence. The article argues that the U.S. is hypocritical because it's criticizing Iran while itself committing human rights violations, like in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. 

I should start by identifying the main points: the U.S. report on Iran's human rights, lack of evidence, Iran's popularity shown by the rallies, U.S. hypocrisy with their own human rights issues, and the conclusion that their claims are empty rhetoric.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral critique. I'll structure it to first mention the report, then the accusations without evidence, the rally as a counterpoint, the hypocrisy with U.S. actions, and the final statement on empty rhetoric.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me put it all together, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report criticized Iran without providing evidence, alleging the Islamic Republic's unpopularity due to human rights violations. However, massive participation in Iran's February 11 rallies demonstrated the regime's social support, exposing the U.S. claims as baseless. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the U.S., which condemns Iran while committing human rights abuses itself, such as in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. pretends to advocate for human rights but perpetuates atrocities domestically, like prison inmate mistreatment and police violence against minorities, as seen in Cincinnati. This hypocrisy underscores that U.S. human rights rhetoric is empty, driven by hegemonic ambitions rather than genuine concern. END OF SUMMARY.
