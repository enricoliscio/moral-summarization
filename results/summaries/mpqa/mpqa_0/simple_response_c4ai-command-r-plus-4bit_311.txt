SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 levies baseless accusations against Iran, claiming that the country's government has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the large turnout at Iran's anniversary celebration of the Islamic Revolution demonstrates the fallacy of these claims. The timing of the report is questionable, as the U.S. faces scrutiny for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration's hypocrisy is evident as it condemns other countries while ignoring its own atrocious human rights record, including the harsh treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities within its borders. The claim of advocating for human rights is exposed as mere rhetoric, with no substance to back it up. The U.S. is attempting to tarnish Iran's reputation due to its independent policy stances, demonstrating a clear bias and abuse of power. 

END OF SUMMARY.
