Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of the U.S. State Department's human rights report, especially regarding Iran. It points out that the U.S. accuses Iran without evidence, which is hypocritical because the U.S. itself has human rights issues. 

I should start by noting that the U.S. report accuses Iran without evidence. Then mention the massive participation in Iran's Revolution anniversary to show the system's support. Next, highlight the hypocrisy by pointing out U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Also, include domestic issues like prison abuses and racial tensions leading to riots. Conclude by stating that the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric because they're not practicing what they preach.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the critical tone towards the U.S. while supporting Iran's stance. Make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point to show the moral inconsistency.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report criticized Iran without providing evidence, claiming the Islamic Republic lacks popular support due to human rights violations. However, the massive participation in Iran's February 11 rallies demonstrated strong public backing for the regime, highlighting the baselessness of U.S. accusations. The article argues that these allegations are politically motivated, aiming to tarnish Iran's image for its independent foreign policy. Meanwhile, the U.S. itself faces criticism for human rights abuses, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article condemns the U.S. for hypocrisy, as it promotes human rights internationally while perpetuating crimes against its own citizens, such as prison abuses and racial discrimination. The conclusion is that the U.S.'s human rights rhetoric is empty, as its actions contradict its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
