SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticized Iran without providing evidence, claiming the country has no social base and is unpopular due to human rights violations. However, the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies contradicts these claims. The report is seen as an attempt to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent policy and refusal to bow to US domination. Meanwhile, the US is facing criticism for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US is also guilty of perpetrating atrocities against its own citizens, including ethnic minorities, and has a history of police brutality that has led to riots. The report is seen as empty rhetoric, and the US's claims to advocate human rights are undermined by its own actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
