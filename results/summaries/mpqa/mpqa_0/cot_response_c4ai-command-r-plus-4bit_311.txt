SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which levied allegations of human rights violations against Iran, is being criticized as baseless and unsupported by evidence. The massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies highlights the disconnect between the U.S. claims and reality, suggesting that these accusations are merely attempts to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent policy stance. This is especially evident as the U.S. itself faces sharp criticism from the international community and human rights organizations for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration's claims of advocating for human rights ring hollow when contrasted with the harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic policies towards other nations. These actions reveal the ugly truth behind the U.S.'s empty rhetoric on human rights and its condoning of atrocious crimes within its own borders. END OF SUMMARY.
