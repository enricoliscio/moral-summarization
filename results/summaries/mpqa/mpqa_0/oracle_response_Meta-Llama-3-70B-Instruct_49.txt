SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report is nothing but empty rhetoric, as it fails to provide evidence to support its baseless allegations against Iran. The report's claims of human rights violations in Iran are refuted by the massive participation of Iranians in rallies marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, the US itself is guilty of egregious human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US administration, which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning crimes committed in its own country, such as the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to riots. The harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic policy towards other nations prove that the US's human rights claims are just empty rhetoric. The US refuses to acknowledge its own violations, instead trying to tarnish the image of Iran, which follows an independent policy and refuses to bow to US domination. END OF SUMMARY.
