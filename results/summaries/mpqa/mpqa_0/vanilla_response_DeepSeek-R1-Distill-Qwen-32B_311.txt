Alright, I need to summarize this news article. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so my task is to create a concise summary. The article is about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report from 2001, specifically focusing on Iran. 

First, I should identify the main points. The U.S. accuses Iran of human rights violations without evidence. They claim Iran is unpopular, but the high turnout in Iran's revolution anniversary shows support. The article also points out that the U.S. is hypocritical because it's criticized for its own human rights issues in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Additionally, there are mentions of police violence against minorities in the U.S., like the Cincinnati riot.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. I'll start by stating the U.S. report's accusations against Iran without evidence. Then, mention the Iranian rallies as proof of support. Next, highlight the hypocrisy by noting U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Finally, include the domestic issues like police violence and the conclusion that the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric.

I should keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown. The summary should flow logically, connecting each point smoothly. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department released its 2001 annual human rights report, repeating baseless allegations against Iran without evidence. The report claimed Iran's government lacks popular support due to human rights violations, a claim contradicted by the massive participation in Iran's February 11 rallies celebrating the Islamic Revolution. The article criticizes the U.S. for hypocrisy, as Washington faces criticism for its own human rights abuses, including civilian casualties in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Despite claiming to champion human rights, the U.S. is accused of perpetuating human rights violations domestically, such as police violence against ethnic minorities, exemplified by the Cincinnati riot following the killing of an unarmed Black youth. The article concludes that U.S. human rights claims are empty rhetoric, driven by its hegemonic policies and disregard for its own citizens' rights. END OF SUMMARY.
