SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 levies baseless accusations against Iran, claiming the country has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the large-scale participation of Iranians in the February 11 rallies to commemorate the Islamic Revolution proves these allegations false. The timing of the report is questionable, as the U.S. itself is facing scrutiny for civilian deaths in Afghanistan and the inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The hypocrisy is evident as the U.S. Administration, which portrays itself as a champion of human rights and a global policeman, turns a blind eye to egregious violations within its own borders. The mistreatment of inmates and ethnic minorities by U.S. authorities has sparked riots, yet the country continues to preach human rights while practicing hegemony and belligerence towards other nations. The U.S.'s claims of upholding human rights ring hollow in the face of its own actions. END OF SUMMARY.
