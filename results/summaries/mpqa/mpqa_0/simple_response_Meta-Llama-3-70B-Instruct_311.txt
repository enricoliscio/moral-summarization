SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report is criticized for its hypocrisy and double standards. The report makes baseless allegations against Iran, claiming it has no social base and is unpopular due to human rights violations, despite massive public participation in recent rallies. Meanwhile, the US is accused of human rights abuses itself, including killing innocent civilians in Afghanistan, torturing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and perpetrating atrocities against inmates in US prisons. The mistreatment of ethnic minorities by US police has led to riots, such as the one in Cincinnati. The US claims to advocate human rights, but its actions prove it to be empty rhetoric. The report is seen as an attempt to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent policy and refusal to bow to US domination. The US should focus on addressing its own human rights issues rather than lecturing others.
