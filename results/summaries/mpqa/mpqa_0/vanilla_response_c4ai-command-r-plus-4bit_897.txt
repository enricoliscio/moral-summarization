SUMMARY: A U.S. State Department report criticizes Iran's human rights record, alleging a lack of social base due to violations. Iran refutes these claims, highlighting the large turnout at rallies as proof of popular support. The article accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy, citing criticism of U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. It mentions U.S. human rights violations against inmates and ethnic minorities, with police mistreatment sparking riots. Despite U.S. claims of advocating human rights, its actions suggest empty rhetoric and a double standard. The article concludes that U.S. accusations against Iran are intended to tarnish its image due to Iran's independent policy and refusal to yield to U.S. domination.
