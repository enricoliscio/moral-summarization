SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 makes baseless accusations against Iran, claiming the country has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the large-scale participation of Iranians in rallies to celebrate the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these allegations. The timing of the report is notable, as the U.S. faces criticism for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, despite its claims of advocating for human rights, is complicit in atrocious human rights violations within its own borders, with inmates in U.S. prisons and ethnic minorities facing appalling mistreatment. The harsh treatment of its own citizens and its aggressive foreign policy expose the hypocrisy of the U.S.'s claims to uphold human rights, rendering them mere empty rhetoric. The double standards and selective morality exhibited by the U.S. underscore the need for independent assessments of human rights that are free from political agendas and bias. END OF SUMMARY.
