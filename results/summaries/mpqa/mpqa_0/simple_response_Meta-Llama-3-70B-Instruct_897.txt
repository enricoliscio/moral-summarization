SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report on other countries is nothing but empty rhetoric. The report makes baseless allegations against Iran, claiming it has no social base and is unpopular due to human rights violations, but provides no evidence to support these claims. In reality, Iran's massive public rallies and defiance of US threats demonstrate the opposite. The US is actually guilty of egregious human rights violations itself, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan, torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and brutal mistreatment of ethnic minorities and inmates in US prisons. The US claims to advocate human rights, but its actions prove it is only interested in promoting its own hegemonic and belligerent policies. The report is a thinly veiled attempt to tarnish Iran's image and distract from the US's own human rights abuses.

END OF SUMMARY.
