Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is an opinion piece criticizing the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report. It mentions that the U.S. accused Iran without evidence, calling their allegations baseless. The author points out that millions of Iranians participated in rallies, showing the U.S. claims are empty. 

The U.S. is also criticized for its own human rights violations, like the killing in Afghanistan and torture at Guantanamo. The article argues that the U.S. uses human rights as a tool to dominate others while ignoring its own issues, like prison crimes and police mistreatment leading to riots.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words: failed, charges, allegations, violations, threats, accusations, refuses, domination, killing, torture, treatment, claims, tries, play, condoning, crimes, mistreatment, riots, riot, shot, dead, claim.

I should structure the summary to highlight the hypocrisy of the U.S. by listing their accusations against Iran without evidence and their own violations. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft a summary that starts with the U.S. report, their baseless claims about Iran, the evidence of Iranian support, then the U.S.'s own violations, and conclude with the hypocrisy. I'll make sure to use the key moral terms to maintain the framing.

Wait, I should check if I'm including all the necessary words without making the summary too cluttered. Maybe some words can be grouped together. For example, "failed to provide evidence" covers "failed" and "charges" or "allegations." 

I also need to mention the U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo for "killing," "torture," and "treatment." The Cincinnati riot covers "mistreatment," "riots," "shot," "dead." 

I should ensure the flow is logical, starting with the U.S. report, then Iran's response, followed by U.S. hypocrisy, and ending with the conclusion that their claims are empty.

Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without losing clarity.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report accused Iran of baseless allegations, such as enjoying no social base and committing human rights violations, without providing evidence. These charges were revealed as empty rhetoric, as millions of Iranians participated in rallies marking the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, defying U.S. threats. The U.S., which claims to advocate for human rights, is itself criticized for killing innocent civilians in Afghanistan and torturing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Its harsh treatment of citizens, including crimes against inmates and mistreatment of ethnic minorities, has led to riots, such as the Cincinnati riot sparked by police shooting an unarmed Black youth. The U.S. Administration's claims of promoting human rights are discredited by its own violations and hegemonic policies, proving its rhetoric to be empty. END OF SUMMARY.
