Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article talks about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report from 2001, focusing on Iran. The author accuses the U.S. of making baseless allegations against Iran without evidence. They mention Iran's popularity due to high participation in their Revolution anniversary, countering the U.S. claims. 

The article also points out the irony that while the U.S. criticizes others, they're facing criticism for their actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. The author uses strong moral words like "failed," "violations," "torture," and "crimes" to highlight the hypocrisy of U.S. human rights claims. 

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating the U.S. report's allegations against Iran without evidence. Then, mention Iran's popular support shown through their rallies. Next, contrast this with the U.S. hypocrisy, including their own human rights violations in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Finally, conclude by highlighting the emptiness of U.S. claims due to their own actions and policies.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report accused Iran of baseless allegations, such as having no social base and being unpopular due to human rights violations, without providing evidence. These charges were revealed as empty rhetoric when millions of Iranians participated in rallies marking the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, defying U.S. threats. The report's timing was ironic, as the U.S. itself faced criticism for killing innocent civilians in Afghanistan and torturing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S., which claims to advocate for human rights, condones atrocious violations, including crimes against inmates and mistreatment of ethnic minorities, leading to riots like the one in Cincinnati. The author argues that the U.S.'s harsh treatment of its citizens and hegemonic policies toward other nations expose its human rights claims as empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
