Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral stance.

The article is critical of the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report. It points out that the U.S. makes unfounded allegations against Iran without evidence. The author uses strong terms like "failed," "baseless charges," and "violations" to describe the U.S. claims. They also mention Iran's popularity, evidenced by large rallies, which contradicts the U.S. accusations.

Additionally, the article contrasts the U.S. criticism of Iran with its own human rights issues, such as the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo and police violence against minorities. Words like "killing," "torture," "crimes," and "riots" are used to highlight the hypocrisy of the U.S. stance.

I need to make sure the summary includes these morally charged words and maintains the critical tone towards the U.S. while highlighting Iran's反驳. I should structure the summary to first address the U.S. report's baseless allegations, then Iran's response, and finally the hypocrisy of the U.S. actions.

I'll start by stating that the U.S. report contains baseless allegations against Iran without evidence. Then, mention the massive participation in rallies showing the system's popularity. Next, point out the hypocrisy by listing U.S. human rights violations like Guantanamo, police violence, and riots. Conclude by stating that the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key points are covered with the appropriate moral language. Let me draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include the specified words and maintain the critical framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report accused Iran of baseless allegations, including violations of social support and popularity, without evidence. These charges were refuted by Iran's massive participation in rallies marking the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, defying U.S. threats. The report's timing coincided with criticism of the U.S. for its own human rights violations, such as the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S., which claims to advocate for human rights, is accused of condoning atrocious crimes, including mistreatment of inmates and ethnic minorities, leading to riots like the one in Cincinnati. The author argues that the U.S. hypocrisy is evident, as its harsh treatment of citizens and hegemonic policies reveal its claims of promoting human rights as empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
