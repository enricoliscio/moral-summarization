SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which levies allegations and accusations of human rights violations against Iran, is baseless and unsupported by evidence. The massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies reveals the emptiness of these charges. The U.S., despite claiming to advocate for human rights and playing the role of a global policeman, is itself guilty of condoning atrocious human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The mistreatment of ethnic minorities by U.S. police has led to riots, and the harsh treatment of its own citizens contradicts the country's claims of upholding human rights. Washington's hegemonic and belligerent policies towards other nations further expose its empty rhetoric. The timing of the State Department's report, amid sharp criticism of U.S. human rights violations, underscores the double standards and moral hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
