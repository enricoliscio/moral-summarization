SUMMARY: In a blatant display of hypocrisy, the U.S. State Department released its annual human rights report, levelling baseless accusations against Iran while failing to acknowledge its own human rights violations and those committed with its consent. The report, a tool to tarnish the image of Iran, claims that the Islamic Republic has no social base due to human rights violations, yet millions of Iranians participated in rallies, defying U.S. threats. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces sharp criticism from the international community and human rights organizations for the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, claiming to advocate for human rights, turns a blind eye to atrocious violations within its own borders, including the mistreatment of inmates and ethnic minorities by the police, leading to riots. Their claim of promoting human rights is exposed as mere empty rhetoric, as their actions reveal a hegemonic and belligerent agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
