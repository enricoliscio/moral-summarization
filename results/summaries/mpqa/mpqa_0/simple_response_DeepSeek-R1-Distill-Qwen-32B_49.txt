Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of the U.S. State Department's human rights report, especially regarding Iran. It points out that the U.S. accuses Iran without evidence and notes the irony since the U.S. itself has human rights issues, like in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. The author also mentions the U.S. ignoring its own problems while criticizing others. 

I should highlight the main points: the U.S. report's unfounded claims against Iran, the lack of evidence, the popularity of Iran's system shown by the rallies, and the hypocrisy of the U.S. accusing others while having its own human rights violations. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the critical tone towards the U.S. for its double standards.

Let me structure it: Start by mentioning the U.S. report and its baseless claims against Iran. Then, contrast that with Iran's public support. Next, point out the U.S. hypocrisy by listing their own human rights issues. Conclude by stating the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric due to their own actions. Make sure to include the moral judgment about the U.S. using empty rhetoric.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me put it all together succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report criticizes Iran without evidence, falsely claiming its regime lacks popular support. This is contradicted by Iran's large public rallies celebrating the Islamic Revolution, showing strong public backing. The report's accusations are seen as an attempt to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent foreign policy. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces criticism for its own human rights violations, including civilian deaths in Afghanistan and mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the U.S. claiming to advocate for human rights while perpetrating atrocities and failing to address domestic issues like police violence against minorities. The moral framing underscores that U.S. human rights claims are empty rhetoric, as its actions contradict its rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
