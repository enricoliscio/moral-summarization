Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I should list these words under STEP 1, each on a new line with an asterisk. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's critical of the U.S. State Department's human rights report, particularly regarding Iran. The author accuses the U.S. of baseless allegations and hypocrisy, pointing out their own human rights violations in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. So, the morally framed words would include terms like "allegations," "baseless," "empty rhetoric," "unpopular," "violations," "tarnish," "criticized," "killing," "innocent," "torture," "inhuman," "condoning," "atrocious," "crimes," "mistreatment," "appalling," "riots," "harsh," "hegemonic," "belligerent," and "empty."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these words. The key points are the U.S. report's unfounded claims against Iran, the hypocrisy of the U.S. criticizing others while committing its own violations, and the contrast between their rhetoric and actions.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the U.S. hypocrisy, their baseless accusations, and the evidence of their own human rights issues. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and within the word limit. I'll check that all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved.

### SUMMARY:  
The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report accused Iran of baseless allegations, claiming its government had no social base due to human rights violations. However, Iran's massive participation in the Islamic Revolution anniversary rallies disproved these claims, revealing the U.S. accusations as empty rhetoric. The report came amid criticism of the U.S. for its own human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S., which claims to advocate for human rights, is hypocritical, as it condones atrocious crimes domestically, such as inmate mistreatment and police violence against ethnic minorities, leading to riots. Its harsh treatment of citizens and belligerent foreign policy expose its human rights claims as hollow. END OF SUMMARY.
