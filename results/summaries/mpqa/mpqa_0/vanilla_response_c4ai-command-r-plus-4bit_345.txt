SUMMARY: In its annual human rights report, the U.S. State Department levied accusations of human rights violations against Iran, alleging a lack of social support for the Iranian government due to these violations. However, Iran refutes these claims, pointing to the large turnout at rallies celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution as evidence of popular support for the regime. Iran accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy, highlighting the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article also mentions the harsh treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities in U.S. prisons, as well as hegemonic foreign policies, as proof that U.S. claims of advocating for human rights are mere rhetoric. This reveals a perceived double standard in U.S. actions versus its claims of supporting human rights globally.
