SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 makes baseless allegations against Iran, claiming that the Islamic Republic has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the large-scale participation of Iranians in rallies marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these accusations. The timing of the report is notable, as the U.S. itself faces criticism for killing civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. Administration's claims of advocating for human rights ring hollow when considering its treatment of its own citizens and its aggressive policies towards other nations. The U.S. is accused of condoning atrocious human rights violations within its own prisons and police forces, with incidents of mistreatment of ethnic minorities sparking riots. The article argues that the U.S.'s assertion of being an advocate for human rights is nothing more than empty rhetoric, given its own questionable track record. END OF SUMMARY.
