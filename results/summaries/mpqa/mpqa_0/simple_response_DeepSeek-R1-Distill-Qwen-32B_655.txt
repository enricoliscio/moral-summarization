Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is titled "Opinion: U.S. Human Rights Claims Only Empty Rhetoric." It's about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report from 2001, which criticizes Iran without providing evidence. The author argues that the U.S. is hypocritical because it's criticizing Iran while itself committing human rights violations, like in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.

I should highlight the key points: the U.S. accuses Iran without evidence, the Iranian people's support shown through rallies, and the hypocrisy of the U.S. pointing fingers while committing its own violations. Also, the author mentions domestic issues in the U.S., like prison abuses and police mistreatment of minorities.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral critique. I'll start by stating the main argument, then mention the lack of evidence against Iran, the Iranian response, and the U.S. hypocrisy. Finally, I'll touch on the domestic issues to show the emptiness of their claims.

Let me structure it: U.S. accuses Iran without evidence, Iranians support their government despite U.S. claims, U.S. hypocrisy in their own human rights issues, and the conclusion that their claims are empty.

I should avoid specific details like the rally dates unless necessary, but since it's part of the argument, maybe include it briefly. Also, mention the specific examples like Afghanistan and Guantanamo to show the U.S.'s own violations.

Putting it all together, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows logically, highlighting the moral framing against the U.S.'s empty rhetoric.

The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report criticized Iran without providing evidence, claiming the Islamic Republic lacks popular support due to human rights abuses. However, massive participation in Iran's February 11 rallies demonstrated strong public backing for the government, refuting U.S. allegations. The article accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy, as it condemns Iran while committing human rights violations in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, while advocating for international human rights, condones atrocities domestically, such as prison abuses and police mistreatment of minorities, leading to riots like the one in Cincinnati. The author concludes that the U.S.'s human rights rhetoric is empty, as its actions—harsh treatment of citizens and hegemonic policies—undermine its claims.  

END OF SUMMARY.
