SUMMARY:
The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries is nothing but "empty rhetoric". The report makes "baseless" and "unfounded" allegations against Iran, claiming it has no social base and is unpopular due to human rights violations. However, the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies proves the opposite. Meanwhile, the U.S. is being "sharply criticized" for its own human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the "atrocious" treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. is "condoning" the "ugliest" crimes in its own prisons and perpetrating "appalling" mistreatment of ethnic minorities. The report's claims are mere "empty rhetoric", as the U.S. is actually pursuing a "hegemonic" and "belligerent" policy towards other nations. END OF SUMMARY.
