SUMMARY:
The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report is accused of being "empty rhetoric" as it makes "baseless" and "unfounded" allegations against Iran while ignoring its own human rights violations. The report's claims that Iran's Islamic Republic is "unpopular" are debunked by the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies. Meanwhile, the U.S. is "sharply criticized" by international organizations for its own human rights abuses, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the "atrocious" treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. also perpetuates "ugliest crimes" against its own citizens, including the "appalling" mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to "bloody" riots. The U.S. administration's human rights advocacy is revealed to be "harsh" and "hegemonic," making its claims nothing more than "empty rhetoric."
END OF SUMMARY.
