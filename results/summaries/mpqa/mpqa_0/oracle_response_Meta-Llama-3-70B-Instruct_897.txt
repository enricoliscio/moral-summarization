SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries is accused of being empty rhetoric, as it fails to provide evidence to support its baseless allegations against Iran. The report claims that Iran's government is unpopular due to human rights violations, but the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies proves otherwise. The US is instead guilty of making accusations to tarnish Iran's image, as it refuses to bow to US domination. Meanwhile, the US is criticized for its own human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US condones atrocious human rights violations within its own borders, including mistreatment of ethnic minorities and harsh treatment of its citizens, leading to riots and bloodshed. The US claims to advocate human rights, but its actions prove it to be just empty rhetoric.
