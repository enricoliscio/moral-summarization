Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first. It's about the U.S. State Department publishing their annual human rights report, specifically mentioning Iran. The article criticizes the U.S. for making baseless allegations against Iran without evidence. It also points out the hypocrisy of the U.S. by highlighting their own human rights issues, like the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo and racial issues leading to riots.

Hmm, the user provided an example of a summary, so I should follow that structure. They want the summary to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it needs to be under 200 words. I need to make sure I capture the main points: U.S. accuses Iran without evidence, the report's timing coincides with U.S. criticism over Afghanistan and Guantanamo, and the hypocrisy in U.S. human rights claims.

I should keep the language concise and clear. Maybe start by stating the U.S. published the report, then mention Iran's response, and then contrast with U.S. issues. Make sure to highlight the hypocrisy and the emptiness of the U.S. claims. Also, include examples like the riots in Cincinnati to show the U.S. isn't practicing what they preach.

Wait, the user's example summary is about 180 words. I should aim for similar length. Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the report, U.S. allegations against Iran, the lack of evidence, Iran's popularity shown by rallies, U.S. hypocrisy with their own issues, and the conclusion that their claims are empty.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each point is covered succinctly without going over the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. State Department released its 2001 annual human rights report, repeating unfounded allegations against Iran without evidence. The report claimed Iran's government lacks popular support due to human rights violations, but this was disproven by massive participation in Iran's February Revolution anniversary rallies. The article criticizes the U.S. for hypocrisy, as it faces global condemnation for its own human rights abuses, including civilian deaths in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Despite claiming to advocate for human rights, the U.S. is accused of perpetuating crimes against its own citizens, such as police violence against ethnic minorities, exemplified by riots in Cincinnati. The article concludes that U.S. human rights claims are empty rhetoric, driven by hegemonic policies rather than genuine concern.  
END OF SUMMARY.
