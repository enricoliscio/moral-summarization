SUMMARY:

The US State Department has released its annual report on human rights in other countries, repeating allegations against Iran without providing evidence. The report claims Iran's government is unpopular due to human rights violations, but this is contradicted by the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies. The US is criticized for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US is accused of condoning atrocities within its own borders, such as brutal treatment of inmates in prisons and police mistreatment of ethnic minorities, which has led to riots. The article argues that the US claim to advocate human rights is empty rhetoric, as its harsh treatment of its own citizens and belligerent policy towards other nations contradict its words.
