SUMMARY: 
The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which made allegations of human rights violations against Iran, is being criticized as baseless and unsupported by evidence. The massive participation of Iranians in rallies marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts the claim that the Islamic Republic lacks social support due to human rights issues. The timing of the report is questionable given the U.S.'s own human rights controversies, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, despite its claims of advocating for human rights and playing a global policing role, is accused of condoning atrocious human rights violations within its own borders. The harsh treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities by U.S. authorities has sparked riots and brought attention to the ugly reality of systemic racism and police brutality in the country. The article concludes that the U.S.'s assertion of being a champion of human rights is merely empty rhetoric, given its own track record of human rights abuses and aggressive foreign policy.
