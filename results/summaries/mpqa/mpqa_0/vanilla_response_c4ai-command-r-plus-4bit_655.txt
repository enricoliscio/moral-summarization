SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 levies accusations against Iran for human rights violations, alleging that the country has no social base due to these violations. However, the large participation of Iranians in rallies celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these claims. The article suggests that the U.S. accusations are attempts to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent policy stance. This is highlighted by the timing of the report, as the U.S. itself faces criticism for civilian killings in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article concludes that the U.S. claim of advocating for human rights is empty rhetoric, given its own human rights violations against inmates and ethnic minorities, as well as its hegemonic foreign policy.
END OF SUMMARY.
