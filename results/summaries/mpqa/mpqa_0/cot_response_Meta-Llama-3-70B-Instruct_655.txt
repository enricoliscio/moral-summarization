SUMMARY:
The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries is criticized for its "baseless" and "unfounded" allegations against Iran. The report's claims of human rights violations in Iran are deemed "empty" rhetoric, as millions of Iranians participated in rallies to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, the U.S. is accused of "atrocious" human rights violations in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay, where prisoners are subjected to "torture" and "inhuman treatment". The report's timing is seen as hypocritical, as the U.S. itself is guilty of "ugliest" crimes against its own citizens, including "appalling" mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to "bloody" riots. The U.S. claim to advocate human rights is dismissed as "empty" rhetoric, masking its "harsh" treatment of citizens and "hegemonic" and "belligerent" policy towards other nations.
END OF SUMMARY.
