SUMMARY:
The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report is nothing but "empty rhetoric" as it fails to provide evidence to support its "baseless" and "unfounded" allegations against Iran. Meanwhile, the U.S. itself is guilty of "atrocious" human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the "inhuman" treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The report's timing is ironic, as the U.S. is being "sharply criticized" by international organizations for its own human rights abuses. The U.S. claims to advocate human rights, but its "harsh" treatment of its own citizens and "hegemonic" policy towards other nations prove otherwise. The report is simply a tool to "tarnish" Iran's image and justify U.S. "domination". END OF SUMMARY.
