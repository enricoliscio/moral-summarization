Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of the U.S. State Department's human rights report, particularly focusing on Iran. It accuses the U.S. of making baseless claims against Iran without evidence, highlighting the contradiction when the U.S. itself is criticized for human rights abuses like those in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The summary should reflect the author's perspective that the U.S. uses human rights rhetoric hypocritically, using it to criticize others while committing similar violations.

I'll start by noting the U.S. report's claims against Iran without evidence. Then, I'll mention the Iranian public's support as shown by their participation in rallies. Next, I'll contrast this with the U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo, pointing out the hypocrisy. Finally, I'll include the domestic issues in the U.S., like police violence and prison conditions, to emphasize the emptiness of their rhetoric.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral critique is clear. I'll structure it to highlight the hypocrisy and the lack of credibility in the U.S. claims.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report criticized Iran without providing evidence, claiming the Islamic Republic lacks popular support due to human rights violations. This was contradicted by the massive participation of Iranians in rallies marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, showcasing the regime's social base. The report's accusations were seen as an attempt to tarnish Iran's image for its independent foreign policy. Meanwhile, the U.S. itself faced criticism for its human rights abuses, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the U.S. claiming to advocate for human rights while perpetrating atrocities and practicing harsh domestic policies, such as police violence against ethnic minorities and poor prison conditions. These actions reveal the emptiness of U.S. human rights rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
