SUMMARY: In its annual report on global human rights, the U.S. State Department levels baseless accusations against Iran, claiming the country has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies proves these charges wrong. The U.S.'s own human rights record is highly questionable, with sharp criticism from other countries and human rights organizations for civilian deaths in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration's claims of advocating for human rights ring hollow when considering the harsh treatment of its own citizens and its aggressive foreign policy. The double standards and empty rhetoric on human rights expose the U.S.'s true nature, using such claims as a tool to tarnish the image of independent nations like Iran that refuse American domination. The U.S. has no moral high ground when it comes to human rights, and its accusations are merely a cover for its hegemonic agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
