SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 repeats baseless allegations against Iran, claiming the country has no social base due to human rights violations. However, the participation of millions of Iranians in rallies to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these charges. The U.S.'s own human rights record is highly questionable, with sharp criticism from other countries and human rights organizations for the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, despite claiming to advocate for human rights and playing the role of a global policeman, turns a blind eye to atrocious human rights violations within its own borders, including crimes against inmates in prisons and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to riots. The U.S.'s harsh treatment of its citizens and its hegemonic foreign policy reveal that its claims of upholding human rights are nothing more than empty rhetoric. The frequent accusations and charges against other countries seem to be a strategy to dominate and tarnish the image of those who refuse to bow to U.S. influence. END OF SUMMARY.
