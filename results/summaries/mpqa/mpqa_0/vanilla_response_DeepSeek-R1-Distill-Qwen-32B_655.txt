Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report from 2001. They criticized Iran without providing evidence, which the article argues is baseless. It mentions Iran's popularity because of their high participation in rallies despite U.S. threats. 

The article also points out the irony that while the U.S. is criticizing others, they're facing criticism themselves for actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. There's mention of human rights violations in the U.S., like prison abuses and police mistreatment of minorities leading to riots. The main point seems to be that the U.S. is hypocritical, using human rights as a tool against Iran while ignoring their own issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the U.S. report's accusations against Iran without evidence, the lack of social base claim, the rally participation showing Iran's support, and the hypocrisy of the U.S. with their own human rights issues. Also, the conclusion that the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric.

Let me structure this: start with the U.S. report and its accusations, mention Iran's rally participation, then the U.S. hypocrisy with their own issues, and end with the conclusion about empty rhetoric. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear but brief.

This was challenged by Iran's large-scale participation in February rallies celebrating the Islamic Revolution, defying U.S. threats. The article highlights the hypocrisy of U.S. human rights claims, as Washington faces criticism for its actions in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. is accused of condoning human rights violations domestically, such as prison abuses and police mistreatment of minorities, leading to riots. The article concludes that U.S. human rights rhetoric is empty, as it focuses on others while ignoring its own issues. END OF SUMMARY.
