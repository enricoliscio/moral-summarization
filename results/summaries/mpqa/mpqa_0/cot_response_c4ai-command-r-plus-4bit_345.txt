SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which includes unfounded allegations against Iran, has been criticized as mere rhetoric by an Iranian news source. The report accuses Iran of human rights violations, claiming that the Islamic Republic has no social base due to these violations. However, the massive participation of Iranians in rallies celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these charges. The news article argues that the U.S. makes these baseless accusations to tarnish Iran's image because it refuses to bow to U.S. domination. Interestingly, the report comes at a time when the U.S. itself is facing sharp criticism from the international community and human rights organizations for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, which claims to advocate for human rights, is instead condoning atrocious crimes committed within its own borders, such as the harsh treatment of inmates and the bloody mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police. These actions belie the U.S.'s moral high ground and expose its claims as empty rhetoric, especially when coupled with its hegemonic and belligerent policies towards other nations. END OF SUMMARY.
