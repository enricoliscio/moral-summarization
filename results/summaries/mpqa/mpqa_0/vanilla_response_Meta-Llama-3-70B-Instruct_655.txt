SUMMARY:

The US State Department has released its annual report on human rights in other countries, including Iran. The report repeats allegations against Iran, but fails to provide evidence. The report claims Iran's government is unpopular due to human rights violations, but this is contradicted by the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies. The US is accused of making baseless accusations to tarnish Iran's image because of its independent policy. Meanwhile, the US is criticized for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US is also guilty of perpetrating crimes against its own citizens, including mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to riots. The article argues that the US's claims to advocate human rights are empty rhetoric, and its harsh treatment of its own citizens and belligerent policy towards other nations prove this.
