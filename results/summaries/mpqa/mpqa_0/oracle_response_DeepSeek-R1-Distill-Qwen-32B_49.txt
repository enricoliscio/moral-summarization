Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, specifically targeting Iran. The author accuses the U.S. of making baseless allegations without evidence, highlighting that Iran's social support is strong, as shown by the massive participation in their revolution anniversary. The U.S. is portrayed as trying to tarnish Iran's image because Iran doesn't submit to U.S. dominance. 

Then, the article points out the hypocrisy of the U.S. by mentioning their own human rights issues, like the killing in Afghanistan and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo. It criticizes the U.S. for claiming to advocate human rights while committing atrocities themselves. The author uses strong moral words like "failed," "allegations," "violations," "killing," "torture," and "crimes" to emphasize the hypocrisy.

I need to make sure my summary includes these morally charged words. I'll start by stating that the U.S. report made unfounded claims about Iran without evidence. Then, mention Iran's strong social support as a counterpoint. Next, highlight the hypocrisy by pointing out the U.S.'s own human rights violations, using the specific examples given. Finally, conclude that the U.S. claims are empty rhetoric because of their actions.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include as many of the specified moral terms as possible without making the summary too wordy. Let me structure it step by step to cover all the key points while maintaining the moral tone.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's 2001 human rights report accused Iran of baseless allegations, including human rights violations and a lack of social support, without providing evidence. These charges were disproven by the massive participation of Iranians in the Islamic Revolution's anniversary rallies, demonstrating the Islamic Republic's strong social base. The report's claims were seen as an attempt to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent foreign policy. Meanwhile, the U.S. itself faced criticism for its own human rights violations, such as the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the U.S. claiming to advocate for human rights while perpetrating atrocities and mistreating its own citizens, including ethnic minorities, leading to riots like the one in Cincinnati. The U.S.'s harsh treatment of citizens and hegemonic policies expose its human rights claims as empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
