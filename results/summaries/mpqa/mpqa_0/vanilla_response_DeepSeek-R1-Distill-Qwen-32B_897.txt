Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, specifically focusing on Iran. It mentions that the U.S. made allegations without evidence and that Iran's large participation in their revolution anniversary shows the U.S. claims are baseless. 

I should note that the U.S. is criticized for its own human rights issues, like the situation in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Also, the article points out the hypocrisy of the U.S. advocating for human rights while having problems at home, like police violence against minorities leading to riots.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the U.S. published the report, the allegations against Iran without evidence, and the Iranian response. Then, I'll mention the U.S. criticism for their own human rights violations. Finally, highlight the hypocrisy and the conclusion that the claims are empty rhetoric. 

Let me structure it step by step to ensure all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department released its 2001 annual human rights report, which included unfounded allegations against Iran, such as claiming the Islamic Republic lacks popular support due to human rights violations. These accusations were deemed baseless, as millions of Iranians participated in rallies marking the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, defying U.S. threats. The report was published amid criticism of the U.S. for its own human rights violations, including civilian casualties in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the U.S. claiming to advocate for human rights while perpetuating atrocities domestically, such as police violence against ethnic minorities and prison abuses. It concludes that the U.S. allegations against Iran are empty rhetoric, driven by its hegemonic policies. END OF SUMMARY.
