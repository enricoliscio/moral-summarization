SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 repeated its allegations against Iran, but provided no evidence to support its charges. The report claimed that Iran's Islamic Republic has no social base and is unpopular due to human rights violations. However, the large participation of Iranians in rallies on Feb. 11, 2001, to celebrate the Islamic Revolution defies these claims. The U.S. accusations are seen as attempts to tarnish Iran's image due to its independent policy and refusal to bow to U.S. domination. Ironically, the report was released at a time when the U.S. itself is being criticized for killing civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhumane treatment of Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, which claims to advocate for human rights and acts as a global policeman, is accused of condoning severe human rights violations within its own borders, including crimes against inmates and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has sparked riots. The U.S.'s harsh treatment of its citizens and aggressive policies towards other nations contradict its claims of promoting human rights, revealing these claims as empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
