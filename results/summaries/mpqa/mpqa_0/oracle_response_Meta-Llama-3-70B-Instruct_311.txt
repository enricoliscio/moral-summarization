SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on other countries is mere empty rhetoric, as it fails to provide evidence for its baseless allegations against Iran. Meanwhile, the report conveniently ignores the US's own human rights violations, such as the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US administration, which claims to advocate international human rights, is actually condoning atrocious human rights violations within its own borders, including the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to massive riots. The report's allegations against Iran are simply a means to tarnish its image, as the country refuses to bow to US domination. The US's harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic policy towards other nations prove that its human rights claims are nothing but empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
