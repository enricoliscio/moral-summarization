SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries is nothing but empty rhetoric, as it fails to provide evidence for its baseless allegations against Iran. The report's claims of human rights violations in Iran are refuted by the massive participation of Iranians in rallies celebrating the Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, the US itself is guilty of egregious human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US administration, which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning atrocities committed within its own borders, such as the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to riots and bloodshed. The harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic policy towards other nations expose the US's human rights claims as nothing but a facade. The report's accusations against Iran are merely a thinly veiled attempt to tarnish the country's image and justify US domination. END OF SUMMARY.
