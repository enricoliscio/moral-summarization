SUMMARY:

The US State Department has released its annual report on human rights in other countries, which includes unfounded allegations against Iran. The report claims that Iran's government is unpopular due to human rights violations, but this is contradicted by the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies. The US is accused of making baseless accusations to tarnish Iran's image because of its independent policy. Meanwhile, the US is criticized for its own human rights violations, including the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The US is also guilty of condoning human rights abuses within its own borders, including brutal treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities by police. Recent riots in Cincinnati, sparked by the police killing of an Afro-American youth, highlight the US's own human rights issues. The US's claim to advocate human rights is seen as empty rhetoric, masking its own hegemonic and belligerent policies.
