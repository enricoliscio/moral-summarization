SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries for 2001 repeated *allegations* against Iran, claiming the country has no social base due to its *unfounded* human rights violations. However, the participation of millions of Iranians in rallies marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution contradicts these *baseless* claims. The timing of the report is questionable, as the U.S. faces criticism for its own human rights record, particularly in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration, despite claiming to advocate for human rights, is *condoning* some of the most *atrocious* human rights violations within its own borders, including the *ugly* treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities by police, which has sparked *bloody* riots. The harsh treatment of its citizens and its hegemonic foreign policy reveal the *emptiness* of the U.S.'s human rights rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
