SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries is accused of being empty rhetoric, as it fails to provide evidence for its baseless allegations against Iran. The report's claims of human rights violations in Iran are refuted by the massive participation of Iranians in rallies celebrating the Islamic Revolution. Meanwhile, the U.S. is criticized for its own human rights violations, including the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and the torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. administration is accused of condoning atrocities committed in its own prisons and perpetrating mistreatment of ethnic minorities, leading to riots and bloodshed. The report's allegations against Iran are seen as a attempt to tarnish its image and dominate its independent policy. The U.S.'s harsh treatment of its citizens and aggressive policy towards other nations expose its claims of advocating human rights as mere empty rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
