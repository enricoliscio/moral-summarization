SUMMARY: In a recent opinion piece, the author criticizes the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights in other countries, specifically its allegations against Iran. The piece argues that the U.S. allegations are baseless and unsupported by evidence, and that the massive participation of Iranians in recent rallies proves the popularity of the Islamic Republic and refutes U.S. charges of human rights violations. The timing of the U.S. report is also questioned, as the U.S. itself faces criticism for killing civilians in Afghanistan and the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The article further accuses the U.S. Administration of condoning human rights violations within its own borders, including crimes against inmates and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by police, which has led to riots. The harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic foreign policy contradict the U.S. claim of advocating for human rights, revealing it as mere empty rhetoric. The article concludes that the U.S. accusations against Iran are intended to tarnish its image due to its independent policy and refusal to bow to U.S. domination. END OF SUMMARY.
