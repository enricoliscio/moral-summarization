SUMMARY: The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes other countries, including Iran, for their human rights records, is seen as empty rhetoric by many. The article argues that the U.S. itself has committed human rights violations, such as the killing of civilians in Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. It also highlights the harsh treatment of inmates and ethnic minorities within the U.S., contrary to its claims of advocating for human rights. The massive participation of Iranians in rallies against U.S. threats undermines the allegation that Iran's government lacks social support due to human rights violations. The timing of the report, as the U.S. faces criticism for its own human rights record, further highlights the perceived hypocrisy of the U.S. as a self-proclaimed advocate for human rights and global policeman. 

END OF SUMMARY.
