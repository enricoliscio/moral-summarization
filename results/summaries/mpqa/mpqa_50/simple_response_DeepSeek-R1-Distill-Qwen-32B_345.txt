Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. It mentions that the OAU and African countries praised the election as free and fair, while Western countries condemned it. The OAU observer team led by Gertrude Mongella stated the elections were transparent and credible. Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion and emphasizing that Zimbabweans should decide their leader. Kenyan President Moi also congratulated Mugabe, and SADC considered the vote a true reflection of the people's will. South Africa and Nigeria's reactions are noted, with Nigeria yet to announce their verdict.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election. They accused it of being flawed, with Mugabe stealing the vote, and some countries planning sanctions or cutting aid.

The final results show Mugabe won with 56.2%, while Tsvangirai got 41.96%. About 3.4 million out of 5.6 million registered voters participated.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." and starting after "SUMMARY:". It should preserve the moral framing, meaning highlighting the divide between African support and Western condemnation.

I need to structure this concisely. Start with Mugabe's reelection, mention African support and Western criticism. Include key points from both sides, like the OAU's observation, Mkapa's statement, and Western accusations. Mention the results briefly. Keep it under 200 words.

Let me draft that, making sure to include the main points and the opposing moral viewpoints.
