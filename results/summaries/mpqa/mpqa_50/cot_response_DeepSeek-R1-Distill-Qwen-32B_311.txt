Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the context.

The article is about Zimbabwe's presidential election where Robert Mugabe was re-elected. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries, like Tanzania and Kenya, praised the election as free and fair. They support Mugabe, calling him a champion of democracy and sovereignty. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also endorsed the results, saying they reflect the people's will.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark condemned the election. They criticized it as flawed, unfair, and undemocratic. The US and UK mentioned violence and intimidation tactics by Mugabe's government, and some countries like Denmark are cutting aid and considering sanctions.

The election results show Mugabe got 56.2% of the votes, while the opposition got around 42%. Voter turnout was about 61%, which is significant.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral judgment. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

Positive moral words: praised, free, fair, transparent, credible, democratic, consistent, inalienable rights, freedom, confidence, high esteem, legitimate, systematic, stolen, enormous implications, toughening sanctions, controversial, independence.

Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral connotation. Let me refine that.

Looking again, words like "praised," "free," "fair," "transparent," "credible," "democratic," "consistent," "inalienable rights," "freedom," "confidence," "high esteem," "legitimate," "systematic," "stolen," "enormous implications," "toughening sanctions," "controversial," "independence." These are all single words that carry a moral or evaluative tone.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, using as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight the divide between African support and Western condemnation, the election results, and the implications for Zimbabwe's international relations.

I'll start by stating Mugabe's re-election and the mixed reactions. Then mention the African support, the Western criticism, and the results. Finally, note the consequences like sanctions and aid cuts.

Let me structure that:

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was re-elected in a controversial vote, with African countries praising the election as free and fair, while Western nations condemned it as flawed. The OAU and SADC endorsed the results, calling them a true reflection of the people's will. However, the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election process, citing irregularities and intimidation. Mugabe secured 56.2% of the votes, defeating the opposition. Western countries are considering sanctions and aid cuts, impacting Zimbabwe's international relations and economy.

That should cover the key points while preserving the moral framing.
