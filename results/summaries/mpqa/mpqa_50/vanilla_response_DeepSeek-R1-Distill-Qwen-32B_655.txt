Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. The user provided the full article, so I should read through it carefully to identify the key points.

First, Mugabe was re-elected, and the article mentions reactions from different countries and organizations. The OAU and African countries praised the election as free and fair, while Western countries condemned it. I should note the specific statements from the OAU observer team and the Tanzanian and Kenyan presidents.

Next, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also supported the election results, stating they reflect the people's will. On the flip side, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election, with some planning sanctions or cutting aid. I should include the voter percentages and the voter turnout to give context on the election's competitiveness.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers both the African support and Western criticism. Also, include Mugabe's victory margin and the international reactions succinctly.

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's reelection, then mention the African support, followed by Western condemnation, and end with the election results. Keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and factual. Make sure to include key countries and their positions, as well as Mugabe's percentage of the vote. Also, note the voter turnout and the fact that it was the closest election since independence.

I think that's all. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the essential points without unnecessary details.

However, Western countries condemned the election, with the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticizing it as flawed and unfair. The U.S. and others threatened sanctions, while Denmark planned to cut aid. Mugabe secured 56.2% of the vote, defeating opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who received 41.96%.
