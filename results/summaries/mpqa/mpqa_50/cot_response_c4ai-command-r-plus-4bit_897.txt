SUMMARY:
The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been a subject of contrasting reactions, with praise from African countries and organizations such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and condemnation from some western countries. The OAU observer team, led by Gertrude Mongella, described the election as "free and fair," while Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a champion of democracy and highlighting the importance of African self-determination. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi also sent his congratulations, citing the reelection as a testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe have for Mugabe. The SADC Council of Ministers appealed to the people of Zimbabwe to accept the results, considering the vote a true reflection of the people's will. However, the election was condemned by western countries such as the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, who cited issues like intimidation, violence, and a flawed democratic process. They have threatened further sanctions and discussed the possibility of toughening existing ones. US Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Walter Kansteiner and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were particularly critical, with Straw stating that Mugabe had "stolen" Zimbabwe's vote. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the votes, in the country's closest presidential election since independence.
