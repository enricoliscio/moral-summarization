Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first.

The article is about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. It mentions that the OAU and African countries praised the election as free and fair, while Western countries condemned it. The OAU observer team led by Gertrude Mongella stated that the elections were transparent and credible. Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion. Kenyan President Moi also congratulated him, and the SADC considered the vote a true reflection of the people's will. South Africa and Nigeria also supported the elections.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election. They accused Mugabe of stealing the vote and conducting a violent campaign. The US and UK mentioned possible sanctions, and Denmark even planned to cut aid and close its embassy.

The election results showed Mugabe won with 56.2% of the votes, while the opposition got 41.96%. About 3.4 million out of 5.6 million registered voters participated.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Mugabe's reelection, African support, Western condemnation, election results, and the reactions from different countries. I'll make sure to mention the main organizations and countries involved, the reasons for support and criticism, and the outcome of the election.

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's reelection, mention the support from African countries and OAU, then the criticism from Western countries, and finally the election results. I should keep it concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary details.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and covers all essential points.
