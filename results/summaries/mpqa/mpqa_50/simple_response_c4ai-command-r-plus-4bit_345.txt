SUMMARY: The moral and democratic integrity of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been applauded by numerous African organizations and nations, including the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). OAU observer Gertrude Mongella affirmed the election as "transparent, credible, free and fair." Tanzanian President Mkapa staunchly defended the election, stating that it would be a tragedy for African elections to be determined outside the continent.

In contrast, some Western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, have condemned the election as flawed and illegitimate. US and Danish officials have threatened further sanctions and aid cuts against Mugabe's government. Despite the criticism, Mugabe secured a narrow victory, highlighting the close contest and the complexity of Zimbabwean politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
