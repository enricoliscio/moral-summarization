SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair‚Äù. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a champion of democracy and emphasizing that it's up to the Zimbabwean people to decide their leader. Other African countries, such as Kenya and South Africa, also welcomed the election results. However, Western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, have condemned the election, citing flaws and irregularities. They have threatened further sanctions and aid cuts. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the votes, while opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai received 41.96%. The moral framing of this article suggests that African countries value sovereignty and self-determination, while Western countries are seen as trying to impose their will on African nations.
