SUMMARY: The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has received mixed reactions, with praise from African organizations and countries but condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) described the election as "free and fair" and a "true reflection" of the people's will. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, citing his defense of Zimbabwe's freedom and democracy. However, western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, criticized the election as flawed and undemocratic. They cited violence, intimidation, and unequal chances for candidates. The US and UK suggested further sanctions against Mugabe and his government. Mugabe won Zimbabwe's closest-fought presidential election with 56.2% of the vote, while Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition received 41.96%. The election was extended to a third day due to a high court ruling, with an estimated 3.4 million of the 5.6 million registered voters participating.
END OF SUMMARY.
