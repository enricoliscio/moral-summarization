Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election. Let me read through it carefully.

First, the article talks about Robert Mugabe's reelection. The OAU and African countries are praising it as free and fair, but Western countries are condemning it. The OAU observer team led by Gertrude Mongella says the election was transparent and credible. Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulates Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion. Kenyan President Moi also congratulates him, saying the people have confidence in him. SADC considers the vote a reflection of the people's will, and South Africa's mission says the elections are legitimate. Nigeria is yet to announce their verdict.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark are criticizing the election. They mention flaws, violence, stolen votes, and unequal chances for candidates. The US and others are considering sanctions, and Denmark is cutting aid. The final results show Mugabe got 56.2% and Tsvangirai 41.96%, with about 3.4 million voters out of 5.6 million.

So, the summary should include the key points: Mugabe's reelection, African support, Western condemnation, election results, and reactions from different countries. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
