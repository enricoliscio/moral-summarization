Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. It mentions that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African countries have praised the election as free and fair, while some Western countries have condemned it. The OAU observer team, led by Gertrude Mongella, stated that the elections were transparent and credible. Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion and emphasizing that Zimbabweans should decide their leader. Kenyan President Moi also congratulated Mugabe, and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) agreed that the vote reflected the people's will.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election. They accused Zimbabwe's government of violence, intimidation, and unfair practices. The US mentioned considering further sanctions, while the UK's Foreign Secretary called the election a theft. France and Germany also criticized the fairness. Denmark planned to cut aid and close its embassy.

The election results showed Mugabe won with 56.2% of the vote, while the opposition MDC's Tsvangirai got 41.96%. About 3.4 million out of 5.6 million registered voters participated.

So, the summary should include the praise from African organizations and countries, the condemnation from Western nations, the election results, and the implications of the results. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
