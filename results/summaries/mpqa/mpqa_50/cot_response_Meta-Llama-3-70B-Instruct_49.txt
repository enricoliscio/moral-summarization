SUMMARY:
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection as "free and fair", with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa calling him a "champion of democracy". However, some Western countries have condemned the election, with the US calling it "flawed" and Britain accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote through a "systematic campaign of violence and intimidation". France and Germany have also questioned the election's legitimacy, with Denmark announcing it will cut aid to Zimbabwe and likely shut down its embassy. The election results show Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the votes, while opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai received 41.96%. The African community has urged Zimbabweans to accept the results, calling them a "true reflection" of the people's will.
