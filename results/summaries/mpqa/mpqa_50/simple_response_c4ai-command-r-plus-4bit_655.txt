SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been ethically questioned by some western countries, despite receiving praise from the Organization of African Unity and various African nations. The OAU observer team, led by Gertrude Mongella, described the election as "transparent, credible, free, and fair." Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, emphasizing the confidence and mandate given to him by the people of Zimbabwe. The Southern African Development Community also supported the election results, reflecting the will of the people. However, western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, criticized the election as flawed and intimidated. They threatened sanctions and aid cuts, questioning the fairness and equality of the election process. Mugabe's victory, with 56.2 percent of the votes, was a close fight against the opposition, raising moral concerns among some nations. END OF SUMMARY.
