SUMMARY:
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection as "free and fair," with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa hailing him as a "champion of democracy." The OAU observer team described the election as "transparent, credible, free and fair." However, some Western countries have condemned the election, with the US calling it "flawed" and Britain accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote. France and Germany have also questioned the election's legitimacy, while Denmark has announced it will cut aid to Zimbabwe. Despite this, Mugabe has been reelected with 56.2% of the vote, with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) receiving 41.96%. The African community has largely accepted the results, with the South African government welcoming the peaceful conduct of the election. END OF SUMMARY.
