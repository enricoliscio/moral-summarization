SUMMARY:

The re-election of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been praised by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), African countries, and some regional organizations, who deemed the election "free and fair". Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, emphasizing the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people. The South African government also welcomed the peaceful conduct of the election. However, Western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, condemned the election as "flawed" and "not substantially free and fair", citing a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation. They threatened further sanctions and aid cuts. The moral framing of this event highlights the clash between African sovereignty and Western interference, with African leaders defending the democratic rights of their people against Western attempts to dictate the outcome.
