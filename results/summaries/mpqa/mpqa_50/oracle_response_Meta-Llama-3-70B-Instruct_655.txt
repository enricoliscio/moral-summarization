SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair." The OAU observer team leader, Gertrude Mongella, stated that the election was "transparent, credible, free and fair." Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a "champion of democracy" who has defended the people's "inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government." Other African countries, including Kenya and South Africa, have also welcomed the election results, considering them a "true reflection" of the people's will.

In contrast, some western countries have condemned the election, calling it "flawed" and accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote through a "systematic campaign of violence and intimidation." The US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark have threatened to impose sanctions or cut aid to Zimbabwe. The moral divide between African and western countries on the legitimacy of the election is clear.
