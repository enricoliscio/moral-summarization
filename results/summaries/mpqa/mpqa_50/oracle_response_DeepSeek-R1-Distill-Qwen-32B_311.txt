Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, where Mugabe was re-elected. The OAU and African countries praised the election as free, fair, transparent, and credible. They called it a reflection of the people's will and legitimate. On the other hand, Western countries condemned it as flawed, with some using strong terms like "stolen," "violence," and "intimidation." They mentioned conducting a campaign to achieve power at all costs and planned sanctions.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like free, fair, transparent, credible, democracy, mandate, defending, freedom, reflection, legitimate, flawed, sanctions, conducted, violence, intimidation, stolen, chances, cut, shut, toughening. 

I'll start by stating that Mugabe's re-election was praised by African organizations but condemned by Western countries. Highlight the OAU's assessment as free, fair, transparent, and credible. Mention African leaders' support, like Mkapa calling Mugabe a democracy champion. Then, note the Western criticism, using terms like flawed, stolen, violence, intimidation. Include the sanctions and aid cuts. Finally, mention the election results, Mugabe's 56.2% vs Tsvangirai's 41.96%, and the voter turnout.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the key moral terms are included without making it too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection was praised by African organizations like the OAU and SADC, which described the March 9-11 election as "free, fair, transparent, and credible," reflecting the people's will. African leaders, including Tanzanian President Mkapa, congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion and defender of Zimbabwe's freedom. However, Western countries condemned the election as "flawed," with the US, UK, France, and Germany criticizing it as "stolen" and "undemocratic," citing violence, intimidation, and unequal chances for candidates. Some nations, like Denmark, announced aid cuts and embassy closures, while the EU considered toughening sanctions. Despite the controversy, Mugabe secured 56.2% of the vote, the closest election since independence, with 3.4 million voters participating. END OF SUMMARY.
