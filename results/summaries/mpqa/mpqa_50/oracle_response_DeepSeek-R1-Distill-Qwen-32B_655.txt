Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that need to be included. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. Some African organizations like OAU and SADC support it, calling the election free, fair, transparent, and credible. African leaders like Tanzanian President Mkapa praise Mugabe for democracy and his consistent defense of the people's rights. They argue that Zimbabweans should decide their own leader without interference.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark condemn the election as flawed, using terms like stolen, violence, intimidation, and unfair chances. They plan sanctions and cutting aid, even closing embassies.

I need to include the morally framed words: free, fair, transparent, credible, democracy, mandate, defending, freedom, reflection, legitimate, flawed, sanctions, conducted, violence, intimidation, designed, stolen, chances, cut, shut, toughening.

I should structure the summary to first mention the African support, then the Western condemnation, and include the vote percentages. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points and the required words.

Let me start by stating Mugabe's reelection and the mixed reactions. Then mention OAU's support with the terms, African leaders' congratulations, and the SADC's stance. Then switch to Western countries' condemnations, using their terms, and the planned sanctions. Finally, include the election results.

I need to ensure that all the morally framed words are included without making the summary too lengthy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point and term is covered.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection was praised by African organizations like the OAU and SADC, which described the election as "free," "fair," "transparent," and "credible." African leaders, including Tanzanian President Mkapa, congratulated Mugabe, calling him a "champion of democracy" and emphasizing the people's right to decide their leader. However, Western countries condemned the election as "flawed," with the US and UK accusing Zimbabwe of conducting a campaign of "violence" and "intimidation" to "steal" the vote. France and Germany also criticized the election as not "substantially free and fair," while Denmark announced plans to "cut" aid and "shut" its embassy. Mugabe secured 56.2% of the vote, defeating opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. END OF SUMMARY.
