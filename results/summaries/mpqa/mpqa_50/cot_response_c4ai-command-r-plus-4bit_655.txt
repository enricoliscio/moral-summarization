SUMMARY:
The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has been a subject of contrasting reactions, with praise from African organizations and countries, and condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) observer team and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) described the election as "free and fair," with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulating Mugabe as a champion of democracy. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi also extended his congratulations, citing the victory as a reflection of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe have for Mugabe. However, western countries such as the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark have criticized the election, with some calling for sanctions and citing flaws, intimidation, and a stolen vote. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the vote, in what was the country's closest presidential election since independence.
