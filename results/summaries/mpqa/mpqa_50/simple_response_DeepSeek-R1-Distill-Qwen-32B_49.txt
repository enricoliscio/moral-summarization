Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe and the reactions from different countries.

Okay, so the OAU and African countries like Tanzania and Kenya are praising the election as free and fair. They support Mugabe's win, emphasizing democracy and the people's choice. On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark are condemning the election, calling it flawed and considering sanctions.

I should make sure the summary reflects both perspectives clearly. The user wants the moral framing preserved, so I need to highlight the divide between African support and Western criticism. Also, include the election results briefly.

I'll start by stating Mugabe's reelection and the differing reactions. Then mention the OAU's and African leaders' positive views, followed by Western countries' condemnations and their reasons. Finally, note the election results and the implications for Zimbabwe's international relations.

Need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but cover all key points. Make sure to include the main organizations and countries involved, their statements, and the outcome of the election.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been met with praise from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African countries, while Western nations have condemned the election as flawed. The OAU observer team described the March 9-11 election as "free and fair," with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulating Mugabe as a "champion of democracy." Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also endorsed the results, emphasizing the people's right to decide their leadership. In contrast, Western countries like the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election, with the UK's Jack Straw accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote. The U.S. and others hinted at imposing sanctions. Zimbabwe's election results showed Mugabe winning 56.2% of the vote, while opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai secured 41.96%. The divide highlights differing views on democracy and sovereignty in Africa versus Western criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
