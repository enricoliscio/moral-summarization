Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's reelection. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Mugabe's reelection was praised by African organizations like the OAU and SADC, but condemned by Western countries. The OAU observer team called the election free and fair, and Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion. Kenyan President Moi also congratulated him, and the SADC team agreed the vote reflected the people's will. South Africa and Nigeria's reactions are noted, with Nigeria planning to announce their verdict.

On the other hand, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election as flawed and unfair. The US and UK mentioned violence and intimidation, and Denmark planned to cut aid. The election results showed Mugabe won with 56.2% against Tsvangirai's 41.96%, with about 3.4 million voters participating.

I should structure the summary to include both African support and Western criticism, mention the election results briefly, and note the reactions from key countries and organizations. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and balanced.
