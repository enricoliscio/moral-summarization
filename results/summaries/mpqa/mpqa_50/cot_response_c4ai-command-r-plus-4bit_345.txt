SUMMARY:
The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has sparked a moral debate, with praises from African organizations and countries, but condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) observers deemed the election "free and fair," "transparent," and a "true reflection" of the people's will. African leaders congratulated Mugabe, with Tanzanian President Mkapa calling him a "champion" of democracy and highlighting the "tragedy" of determining African election outcomes in Europe. 

In contrast, western nations condemned the election. US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark officials criticized the process, with statements ranging from "flawed" and "intimidation" to "stolen" and lacking "equal chances." The US and UK hinted at further sanctions, while Denmark pledged to cut aid and possibly close its embassy in Harare. 

The differing perspectives on the morality of Mugabe's reelection highlight a divide between African and western interpretations of democracy and election legitimacy.
