SUMMARY: The moral integrity of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been a topic of contrasting opinions between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African countries, who praised the election as free and fair, and western countries, who condemned it. OAU observer team leader Gertrude Mongella affirmed the transparency, credibility, and fairness of the election. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, recognizing his defense of the Zimbabwean people's rights and their confidence in him. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also considered the vote a true reflection of the people's will. In contrast, western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, criticized the election as flawed and intimidated. They suggested sanctions and aid cuts for the Mugabe regime. Mugabe's victory in the closest-fought presidential election since independence highlighted the divide in perceptions between Africa and the West regarding the legitimacy of the democratic process in Zimbabwe.
