SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has received praise from the Organization of African Unity and various African countries but has been condemned by some Western nations. Observers from the OAU, the Southern African Development Community, and the Tanzanian and Kenyan presidents commended the election as free, fair, transparent, and a true reflection of the Zimbabwean people's will. However, the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election as flawed, with allegations of violence, intimidation, and unequal opportunities for candidates. Mugabe won with 56.2% of the vote, while Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition received 41.96%. The election was controversial, with a high court extending voting into a third day. Mugabe's victory has sparked mixed reactions globally, with potential implications for Zimbabwe's international relationships and aid.
