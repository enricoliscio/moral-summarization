SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection as "free and fair", while some Western countries have condemned it. The OAU observer team described the election as "transparent, credible, free and fair". Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a "champion of democracy" and stating that it would be a "great tragedy" for anyone to determine the outcome of an African election in Europe. Other African leaders, such as Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, also congratulated Mugabe on his reelection. However, Western countries, including the US, UK, France, and Germany, have condemned the election as "flawed" and threatened to impose "sanctions" against Mugabe's government, citing a "systematic campaign of violence and intimidation" designed to achieve an outcome of "power at all costs". Denmark has announced plans to "cut" aid to Zimbabwe and "shut" down its embassy in Harare. END OF SUMMARY.
