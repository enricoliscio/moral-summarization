SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair‚Äù. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, stating that it's up to the Zimbabwean people to decide their leader, and that Mugabe has consistently defended their rights to freedom and sovereignty. Other African leaders, including those from Kenya and South Africa, have also welcomed the election results.

In contrast, some Western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, have condemned the election, citing flaws and a lack of fairness. They have threatened further sanctions and aid cuts.

The moral framing of this article highlights the contrast between African countries' emphasis on sovereignty and self-determination, and Western countries' focus on democratic norms and human rights. The article suggests that Western countries' criticism of the election may be seen as an attempt to impose their values on African nations.
