SUMMARY:
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection as "free and fair", with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa calling him a "champion of democracy". The OAU observer team described the election as "transparent, credible, free and fair". However, some western countries have condemned the election, with the US calling it "flawed" and Britain accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote through a "systematic campaign of violence and intimidation". Germany and France also questioned the election's legitimacy, citing unequal chances for candidates. Denmark has announced it will cut aid to Zimbabwe and consider shutting down its embassy. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the vote, while the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) gained 41.96%.
