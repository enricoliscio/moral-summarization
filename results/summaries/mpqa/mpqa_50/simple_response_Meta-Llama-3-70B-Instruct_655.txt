SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair.‚Äù Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a champion of democracy and emphasizing that the outcome of the election should be determined by the people of Zimbabwe, not by Western countries. Other African leaders, including Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the South African government, also congratulated Mugabe and recognized the election as legitimate.

In contrast, Western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, condemned the election, citing flaws and irregularities. They threatened to impose further sanctions on Mugabe's government, with Denmark even considering cutting aid and shutting down its embassy in Harare.

The moral framing of this article highlights the tension between African countries' sovereignty and Western countries' interference in their internal affairs. The article suggests that African countries should be allowed to determine their own democratic processes, free from Western influence and judgment.
