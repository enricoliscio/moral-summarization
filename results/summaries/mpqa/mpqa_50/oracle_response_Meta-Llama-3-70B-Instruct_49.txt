SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection as "free and fair", while some Western countries have condemned it as "flawed". The OAU observer team leader, Gertrude Mongella, stated that the elections were "transparent, credible, free and fair" based on observations made during the voting, verification, and counting process. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a "champion of democracy" who has consistently defended the people of Zimbabwe's "inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government". However, Western countries, such as the US, UK, France, and Germany, have criticized the election, citing "violence and intimidation" and a lack of "equal chances" for candidates. Some have even threatened "sanctions" and "cutting aid" to Zimbabwe. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the valid votes, while the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, received 41.96%.
