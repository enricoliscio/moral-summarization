SUMMARY: The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has received mixed reactions, with praise from African organizations and countries but condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) observer team and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) both described the election as free, fair, and transparent, reflecting the will of the Zimbabwean people. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, with Mkapa emphasizing that it was up to the Zimbabwean people to decide their leader. However, western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, criticized the election as flawed and undemocratic. The US and UK suggested further sanctions against Mugabe and his government, while Denmark announced plans to cut aid and potentially close its embassy in Harare. Mugabe won the closely contested election with 56.2 percent of the vote, defeating opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. The election was extended to a third day due to a high court ruling and saw an estimated 3.4 million of the 5.6 million registered voters participate. END OF SUMMARY.
