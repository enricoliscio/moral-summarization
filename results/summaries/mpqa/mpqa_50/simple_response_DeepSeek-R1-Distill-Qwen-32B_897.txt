Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article mentions that Mugabe's reelection was praised by African organizations like the OAU and SADC, while Western countries condemned it. The OAU observer team called the elections free and fair, and Tanzanian and Kenyan leaders congratulated Mugabe, emphasizing African sovereignty. On the other hand, the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the elections as flawed and unfair, with some threatening sanctions or cutting aid.

I need to capture both the African support and Western criticism, highlighting the moral stances from each side. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Mugabe's win, African support, Western condemnation, election results, and the implications of the reactions.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Mugabe's victory, then the African endorsements, followed by Western criticism, and end with the results and the divide it represents. I'll make sure to include the percentages of votes and the reactions from the EU and other countries regarding sanctions.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check that I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the given information with the moral framing intact.
