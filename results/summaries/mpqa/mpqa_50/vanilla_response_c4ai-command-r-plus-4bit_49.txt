SUMMARY: The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has received mixed reactions, with praise from African organizations and countries but condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) described the election as "free and fair" and a "true reflection" of the people's will. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe, with Mkapa calling him a champion of democracy. However, the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election as flawed and undemocratic, with some threatening further sanctions. Mugabe won the country's closest presidential election, gaining 56.2% of the votes. The election was controversial, with a high court extending voting into a third day. Mugabe's victory has highlighted the divide between African and western nations in their assessment of the election's fairness and legitimacy. END OF SUMMARY.
