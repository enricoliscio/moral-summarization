Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Zimbabwe's election and the reactions from different countries and organizations. The author used specific morally charged words like "free," "fair," "transparent," etc., which I need to include in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The election was held, and the OAU and African countries praised it as free, fair, transparent, and credible. They called it a reflection of the people's will and legitimate. On the other hand, Western countries condemned it as flawed, citing violence, intimidation, stolen votes, and unequal chances for candidates. They plan sanctions and cutting aid.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words and captures the divide between African support and Western criticism. I'll structure it to mention the OAU's positive assessment, the African leaders' congratulations, the SADC and South African support, and then contrast that with Western condemnations and planned sanctions. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the results showing Mugabe's victory.

I should also mention the voter turnout and the percentages to give context. I'll make sure to use the specified words like "mandate," "defending," "freedom," "legitimate," "flawed," "sanctions," "violence," "intimidation," "stolen," etc. 

I'll start by stating the election was held, then the OAU's assessment, followed by African leaders' support. Then switch to Western criticism, their reasons, and actions. Finally, conclude with the results and Mugabe's win.

Let me draft that, making sure to include all key points and the moral framing words without making it too long.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent presidential election, held March 9-11, has been praised by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African countries as "free," "fair," "transparent," and "credible," with the OAU observer team calling it a "true reflection" of the people's will. African leaders, including Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, congratulated President Robert Mugabe, hailing him as a "champion of democracy" and respecting the "mandate" granted by Zimbabweans. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also endorsed the election as legitimate, emphasizing that the results reflect the people's choice. However, Western countries condemned the election as "flawed," citing "violence," "intimidation," and "unequal chances" for candidates. The United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the process, with Britain accusing Mugabe of "stealing" the vote. Some countries, like Denmark, plan to "cut" aid and "shut" embassies, while the EU considers "toughening sanctions." Despite these criticisms, Mugabe secured 56.2% of the vote, defeating Morgan Tsvangirai's 41.96%, in the closest election since independence. END OF SUMMARY.
