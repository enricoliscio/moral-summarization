SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free, fair, transparent, and credible.” Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a “champion of democracy” who has consistently defended the people's “inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government.” The Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the South African government also welcomed the election results, considering them a “true reflection” of the people's will and “legitimate.”

However, some Western countries have condemned the election, calling it “flawed” and accusing Mugabe of “stealing” the vote through a “systematic campaign of violence and intimidation.” The US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark have threatened to impose further “sanctions” on Mugabe's government, with Denmark planning to “cut” aid and “shut” down its embassy in Harare.
