SUMMARY:
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair.” Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a “champion of democracy” who has consistently defended the people's “inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government.” However, some Western countries have condemned the election, calling it “flawed” and accusing Mugabe of “stealing” the vote through a “systematic campaign of violence and intimidation.” The US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark have expressed concerns, with some threatening sanctions. Despite this, the OAU and other African countries have maintained that the election was legitimate and reflected the will of the Zimbabwean people. END OF SUMMARY.
