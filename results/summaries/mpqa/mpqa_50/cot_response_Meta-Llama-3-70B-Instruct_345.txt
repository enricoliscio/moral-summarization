SUMMARY:
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free and fair” and Mugabe as a “champion of democracy”. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, stating that it would be a “tragedy” for anyone to determine the outcome of an African election in Europe. The SADC Council of Ministers considered the vote a “true reflection” of the people's will, and the South African government welcomed the peaceful process. However, some western countries condemned the election, with the US calling it “flawed” and the UK accusing Mugabe of “stealing” the vote. Denmark has announced it will cut aid to Zimbabwe and consider shutting down its embassy. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the votes, while opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai received 41.96%.
