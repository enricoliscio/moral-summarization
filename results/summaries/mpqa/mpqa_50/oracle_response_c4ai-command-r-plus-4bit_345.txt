SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe's reelection as Zimbabwean President has sparked a moral debate, with African nations praising the election as free and fair, while some western countries have condemned it. The OAU observer team and various African leaders, including Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, defended the election's transparency, credibility, and legitimacy, describing it as a true reflection of the people's mandate. They emphasized Mugabe's role in defending Zimbabwe's freedom and democracy. In contrast, western nations, such as the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, criticized the election as flawed and illegitimate. They alleged that Mugabe's government conducted a campaign of violence and intimidation, stealing the election and denying equal chances to the candidates. Western nations also discussed imposing sanctions and cutting aid to Zimbabwe. The election results showed Mugabe winning with 56.2% of the votes, amid a controversial and extended voting process.
