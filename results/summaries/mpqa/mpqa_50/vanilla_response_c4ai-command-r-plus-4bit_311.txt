SUMMARY: The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has received mixed reactions, with praise from African organizations and countries but condemnation from some western nations. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) observer team described the election as "free and fair," and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a champion of democracy. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi also sent his congratulations. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) considered the vote a true reflection of the people's will. However, the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election as flawed and undemocratic, with some threatening further sanctions. Mugabe won the country's closest presidential election since independence, gaining 56.2% of the votes. The election results were controversial, with some alleging a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation by the government. Mugabe's victory has highlighted the differing perspectives on democracy and election legitimacy between Africa and the West. END OF SUMMARY.
