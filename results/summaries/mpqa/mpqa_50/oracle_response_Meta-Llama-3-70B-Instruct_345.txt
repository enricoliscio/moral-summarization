SUMMARY:

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African countries have praised Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection, describing the election as "free, fair, transparent, and credible.” Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a “champion of democracy” who has consistently defended the people's “inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government.” The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also considered the vote a “true reflection” of the people's will, and the South African government welcomed the peaceful election process.

However, some western countries have condemned the election, calling it “flawed” and accusing Mugabe of “stealing” the vote through a “systematic campaign of violence and intimidation.” The US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark have all expressed concerns, with some threatening further “sanctions” against Mugabe's government.
