Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. The OAU and African countries praised the election as free, fair, transparent, and credible. They used words like "mandate," "democracy," and "freedom." On the other hand, Western countries condemned it, using terms like "flawed," "sanctions," "violence," "intimidation," and "stolen."

I should make sure to include these morally charged words in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning the election results and the opposing views. Then, I'll note the African support and the Western criticism, including specific countries and their statements. I'll also include the statistics about the votes and voter turnout. Finally, I'll touch on the consequences like sanctions and aid cuts.

Let me structure this to ensure all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to use the specified moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been praised by African countries and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as "free," "fair," "transparent," and "credible," while Western nations have condemned the election as "flawed." The OAU observer team described the March 9-11 elections as a "true reflection" of the people's will, with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa calling Mugabe a "champion of democracy." Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also supported the results, emphasizing the people's right to decide their leadership. However, Western countries like the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election, with the U.S. and UK accusing Zimbabwe of conducting a campaign of "violence" and "intimidation" to secure power. France and Germany questioned the "equal chances" for candidates, while Denmark announced cutting aid and possibly shutting its embassy. Mugabe won 56.2% of the vote, securing a "legitimate" mandate, while opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai received 41.96%. Western countries may impose "toughening" sanctions, reflecting the divide between African support and international criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
