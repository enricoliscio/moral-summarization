Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Robert Mugabe's reelection in Zimbabwe. It mentions that the OAU and African countries praised the election as free and fair, while Western countries condemned it. The OAU observer team led by Gertrude Mongella called the elections transparent and credible. Tanzanian President Mkapa congratulated Mugabe, calling him a democracy champion and emphasizing that Zimbabweans should decide their leader. Kenyan President Moi also congratulated Mugabe, and the SADC considered the vote a true reflection of the people's will. South Africa and Nigeria also supported the election's legitimacy.

On the flip side, Western countries like the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark criticized the election. They called it flawed, with the US threatening sanctions, the UK accusing Mugabe of stealing the vote, and Denmark cutting aid and considering tougher sanctions.

The final results showed Mugabe won with 56.2% of the vote, the closest since independence, against Tsvangirai's 41.96%.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. That means highlighting the divide between African support and Western criticism, emphasizing the different perspectives on the election's fairness.

I should structure the summary to first mention Mugabe's reelection, then the African support, followed by Western condemnation, and end with the election results. I need to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft that, making sure to include key points from each side and the outcome.
