SUMMARY: The reelection of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has sparked a moral divide, with African nations and organizations praising the election as free and fair, while some western countries have condemned it as flawed and illegitimate. The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and various African leaders, including Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, have congratulated Mugabe and recognized the election as a true reflection of the Zimbabwean people's will. They have emphasized the importance of respecting the sovereignty and democratic choices of Zimbabwe. On the other hand, western nations, such as the US, UK, France, Germany, and Denmark, have criticized the election process, alleging intimidation and inequality. They have threatened sanctions and aid cuts, questioning the legitimacy of Mugabe's victory. The contrasting reactions highlight a moral divide between African nations defending self-determination and western countries imposing their standards of democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
