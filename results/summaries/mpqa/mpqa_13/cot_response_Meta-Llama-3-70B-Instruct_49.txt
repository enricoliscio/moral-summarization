* rejected
* hindered

SUMMARY:
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting was the first since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan, which sparked an international outcry, calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, which President Bush rejected last year, citing concerns that it would hinder US economic growth. The two countries are at odds over the best approach to address climate change, with the US favoring a voluntary approach and Japan committed to the Kyoto protocol's mandatory targets. END OF SUMMARY.
