SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of talks on climate change, aiming to prevent global warming through enhanced cooperation in science and technology. This meeting marked a shift in the US approach to climate change, as President George Bush had previously rejected the Kyoto protocol, causing controversy internationally. The US now emphasizes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth rather than mandatory targets. While Japan remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto protocol, the US pledged to promote research and development to address climate change. This new direction in US policy seeks to balance economic growth with efforts to prevent global warming, indicating a recognition of the importance of both economic prosperity and environmental sustainability.
