* rejected
* voluntary
* mandatory

SUMMARY: There was an international outcry when President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto protocol on climate change, choosing instead to propose voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth rather than mandatory targets. Representatives from Japan and the US met in Tokyo for two days of talks on climate cooperation in science and technology, aiming to prevent global warming. While the US promoted research and development, Japan affirmed its commitment to ratifying the Kyoto protocol, demonstrating a continued moral commitment to addressing climate change through mandatory emissions reductions. The talks highlighted the moral divide between the two nations, with the US prioritizing economic growth and voluntary action over mandatory global agreements. END OF SUMMARY.
