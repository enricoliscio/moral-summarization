Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about US-Japan climate talks. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspective.

The article mentions that the talks ended in Tokyo after two days. They discussed cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US promoted R&D in climate change, while Japan plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused an international outcry, saying it hindered US economic growth.

I need to capture the moral framing here. The US is portrayed as moving away from binding targets, which some might see as less committed to environmental action. Japan, on the other hand, is more committed by ratifying Kyoto, which could be seen as a responsible move. The US's stance is criticized for prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection.

So, in the summary, I should highlight these points: the talks, the US's approach with voluntary limits based on economic growth, Japan's support for Kyoto, and the international reaction to Bush's decision. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral implications without adding my own bias.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Start with the talks ending, mention the topics discussed, the US's promotion of R&D, Japan's intent to ratify Kyoto, and Bush's rejection causing outcry. That should cover the key points and the moral framing.

Let me structure it: mention the talks, the topics, the US's approach, Japan's stance, and the international reaction. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Also, include the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on scientific and technological cooperation to combat global warming. The discussions came after President George Bush introduced a new US plan advocating voluntary greenhouse gas emission limits tied to economic growth, replacing mandatory targets. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its commitment to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international criticism, as it was seen as prioritizing US economic growth over global environmental efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
