SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of talks on climate change, focusing on co-operation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The discussions were held in the context of the United States' recent shift towards voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, a move that caused controversy internationally. The US now emphasizes economic growth over mandatory targets. The US also expressed its commitment to promoting research and development to address climate change. Meanwhile, Japan remains steadfast in its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, a decision that contrasts with the US rejection of the agreement last year, citing concerns about economic hindrances. The talks between the two nations aim to find common ground and explore opportunities for collaboration to tackle the global challenge of climate change.

END OF SUMMARY.
