Okay, I need to summarize the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about US-Japan climate talks ending, discussing cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US is promoting R&D, while Japan still intends to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush rejected Kyoto, causing international outcry, saying it hindered US economic growth.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all single words that are morally framed. Looking through the text, words like "voluntary," "mandatory," "rejected," and "hindered" stand out as having moral connotations. "Voluntary" suggests choice without obligation, which can be seen as less stringent. "Mandatory" implies a requirement, which might be viewed as more responsible. "Rejected" shows a refusal, possibly seen as irresponsible. "Hindered" indicates a negative impact on growth, implying a moral trade-off.

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. I'll start by stating the conclusion of the talks, mention the topics discussed, note the US's promotion of R&D, Japan's intention to ratify Kyoto, and Bush's rejection causing outcry. I'll also include the reasoning about economic growth.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while retaining the moral elements. Let me put it all together, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

**STEP 1:**
* Voluntary
* Mandatory
* Rejected
* Hindered

**SUMMARY:**
US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo, with discussions on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President George Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international outcry, as it was seen as hindering efforts to address climate change. Bush argued that the protocol would impede US economic growth, a decision that drew criticism for its perceived lack of responsibility in global environmental efforts. The talks marked the first since Bush's new plan, which advocates voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. END OF SUMMARY.
