SUMMARY:

The US and Japan have concluded two-day climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on scientific and technological cooperation to combat global warming. This meeting marks the first discussion between the two nations since President George Bush introduced a new climate plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US has pledged to promote research and development on climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol. This stance contrasts with President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol last year, citing concerns about hindering US economic growth. The differing approaches to climate change mitigation highlight the moral imperative of balancing economic interests with environmental responsibility.
