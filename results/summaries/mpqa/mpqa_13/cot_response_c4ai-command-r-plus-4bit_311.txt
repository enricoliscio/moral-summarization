SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of discussions on climate change in Tokyo, seeking cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. These talks followed the unveiling of a controversial US plan by President George Bush, which proposed voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth instead of mandatory targets. The US approach sparked an international outcry as President Bush rejected the Kyoto protocol on climate change, citing hindrance to US economic growth. Despite this, Japan affirmed its commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol, demonstrating its intention to prioritize global environmental efforts. The US, on the other hand, focused on promoting research and development to address climate change. These talks highlighted the differing approaches and moral stances between the two nations regarding their responsibilities and strategies to tackle this pressing global issue. END OF SUMMARY.
