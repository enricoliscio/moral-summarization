SUMMARY: 
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperative efforts in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting marked the first discussion between the two nations since President George Bush introduced a new US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US emphasized its commitment to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reiterated its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The US's rejection of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, citing concerns over hindering economic growth, sparked international outcry. The talks aimed to find common ground in the fight against climate change.
