SUMMARY: 
Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two days of climate change talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting was the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The meeting follows international controversy sparked by President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol last year, citing concerns over US economic growth. The talks aimed to find common ground between the two nations' differing approaches to addressing climate change.
