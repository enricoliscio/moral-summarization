SUMMARY:

Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two-day climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting was the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was rejected by President Bush last year, citing concerns over US economic growth. The talks marked a new effort by the two nations to find common ground on climate change, despite their differing approaches.

END OF SUMMARY.
