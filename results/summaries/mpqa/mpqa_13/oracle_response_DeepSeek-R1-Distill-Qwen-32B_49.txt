Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the article uses words like "prevent" and "promote," so I should keep those in the summary. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The US and Japan had climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US mentioned promoting R&D, while Japan plans to ratify the Kyoto protocol. President Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused international outcry, as it hindered US economic growth.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: the talks, their focus on preventing global warming, the US promoting R&D, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and Bush's decision's impact. I'll make sure to use "prevent" and "promote" as the author did.

I'll structure it by mentioning the talks, their purpose, the US's commitment, Japan's position, and the background on Bush's rejection. That should cover all the necessary points while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The discussions marked the first meeting since President George Bush introduced a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international outcry, as critics argued it hindered US economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
