SUMMARY:
The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperative efforts in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting marks the first discussion between the two nations since President George Bush introduced a new US plan, which promotes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US has pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The US plan has been met with international criticism, with many arguing that it hinders efforts to combat climate change. The Kyoto protocol, which the US rejected in 1997, aimed to prevent global warming by setting binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The differing approaches to addressing climate change highlight the ongoing challenges in finding a unified global response to this pressing issue.
