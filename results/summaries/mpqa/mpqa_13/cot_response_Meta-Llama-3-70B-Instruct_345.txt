* outcry
* rejected
* hindered

SUMMARY:
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting was the first since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan, which sparked an international outcry, calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US promised to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reiterated its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. This move contrasts with President Bush's decision to reject the 1997 Kyoto protocol, citing concerns that it would hinder US economic growth. The differing approaches highlight the ongoing debate between economic growth and environmental responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
