SUMMARY:
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperative efforts in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting marked the first bilateral discussion since President George Bush introduced a new US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The US plan has sparked controversy, as President Bush previously rejected the 1997 Kyoto protocol, citing concerns over US economic growth. The differing approaches highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing environmental concerns with economic interests.
END OF SUMMARY.
