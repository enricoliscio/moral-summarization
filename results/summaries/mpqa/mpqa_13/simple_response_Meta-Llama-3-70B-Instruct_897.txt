SUMMARY:

The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate change talks in Tokyo, focusing on scientific and technological cooperation to combat global warming. This meeting marks the first since President George Bush announced a new US plan, which prioritizes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, sparking controversy. The US has pledged to promote research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirms its commitment to ratifying the Kyoto protocol. The meeting comes on the heels of President Bush's rejection of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, citing concerns over US economic growth. The moral framing of this development is clear: the US's prioritization of economic growth over mandatory emissions targets raises questions about its commitment to addressing the pressing issue of climate change, while Japan's steadfast commitment to the Kyoto protocol demonstrates a stronger moral compass.
