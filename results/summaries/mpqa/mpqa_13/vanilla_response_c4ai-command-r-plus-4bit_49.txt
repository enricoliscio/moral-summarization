SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to address global warming. The meeting followed the US's recent shift from mandatory targets to voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth. The US emphasized its commitment to research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, which the US rejected in 2001. The US's rejection sparked controversy, as President Bush cited concerns about economic hindrances.
