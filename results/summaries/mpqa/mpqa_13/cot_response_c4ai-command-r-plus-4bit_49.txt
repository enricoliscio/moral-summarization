* outcry
* rejected
* intending

SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States held talks on climate change, specifically on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. These talks come after the US unveiled a new plan that favors voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth over mandatory targets. The US faced international outcry when it rejected the Kyoto protocol, a protocol that Japan is still intending to ratify. President Bush's decision to reject the protocol was justified by claiming that it hindered US economic growth.
