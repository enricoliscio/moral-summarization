SUMMARY:

The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. The meeting marks the first discussion between the two nations since President Bush introduced a new plan for voluntary greenhouse gas emissions limits tied to economic growth, sparking controversy. The US pledged to promote research and development on climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol. This move is seen as a moral imperative, as Japan recognizes the urgent need to address climate change, unlike the US, which has prioritized economic growth over environmental concerns. The US's stance has drawn international criticism, as it rejected the Kyoto protocol in 1997, citing economic growth concerns. The moral contrast between the two nations' approaches to climate change is striking, with Japan taking a more responsible and environmentally-conscious stance.
