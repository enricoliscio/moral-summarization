SUMMARY:
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two-day climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperative efforts in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting marked the first dialogue between the two nations since President George Bush introduced a new US plan, which emphasizes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The talks come on the heels of President Bush's controversial rejection of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which he claimed would hinder US economic growth. The differing approaches to addressing climate change highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing environmental concerns with economic interests. END OF SUMMARY.
