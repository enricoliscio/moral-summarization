Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user specified that I should keep the words "prevent" and "promote" in the summary. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about US-Japan climate talks ending in Tokyo. They discussed cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US mentioned promoting R&D in climate change. Japan still plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while President Bush's rejection caused international outcry, saying it hindered US economic growth.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the talks, their purpose, the US's new plan, the focus on R&D, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and Bush's decision's impact. I need to make sure to use "prevent" and "promote" as per the author's framing.

I'll start by mentioning the conclusion of the talks, their focus on preventing global warming through cooperation. Then, note the US's promotion of R&D. Include Japan's intention to ratify Kyoto and Bush's rejection causing outcry. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral words are included.

SUMMARY: US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo, with representatives discussing cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The meeting followed President George Bush's announcement of a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits based on economic growth, a move that drew international criticism after his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year. END OF SUMMARY.
