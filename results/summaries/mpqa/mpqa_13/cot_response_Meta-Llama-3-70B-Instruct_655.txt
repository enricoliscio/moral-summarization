SUMMARY:
The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing ways to cooperate on science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting was the first since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan, which has been met with international outcry. The plan calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, rather than mandatory targets, sparking controversy. The US has pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto protocol, which President Bush rejected last year, citing concerns that it would hinder US economic growth. The talks aim to find common ground between the two nations' differing approaches to addressing climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
