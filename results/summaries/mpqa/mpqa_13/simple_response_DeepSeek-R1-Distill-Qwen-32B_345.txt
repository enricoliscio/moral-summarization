Okay, I need to summarize this news article about US-Japan climate talks. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article mentions that the talks ended in Tokyo after two days. They focused on cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The US introduced a new plan with voluntary limits based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. Japan, on the other hand, plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused international outcry because it was seen as prioritizing economic growth over environmental action.

I need to capture the contrast between the US's voluntary approach and Japan's commitment to Kyoto. The moral framing here is about the US's decision being criticized for hindering international efforts, while Japan is upholding the protocol. I should highlight this contrast in the summary.

I'll start by stating the conclusion of the talks, the topics discussed, and the US's new plan. Then, I'll mention Japan's intention to ratify Kyoto. Finally, I'll note the criticism of Bush's decision to reject Kyoto. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ending with the required tokens.

Let me draft that: The talks concluded with the US focusing on voluntary limits and promoting R&D, while Japan is committed to Kyoto. Bush's rejection caused international concern, highlighting the divide in approaches. That should cover the main points and the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo, with representatives discussing cooperation in science and technology to address global warming. The discussions followed President George Bush's announcement of a new US plan favoring voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international criticism, as it was seen as prioritizing economic growth over global environmental efforts. The talks highlighted the ongoing divide between the US's voluntary approach and Japan's commitment to the Kyoto framework. END OF SUMMARY.
