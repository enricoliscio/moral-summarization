SUMMARY:
Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The meeting was the first since President Bush unveiled a new plan calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, which sparked an international outcry. The US aims to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan still intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The protocol was rejected by President Bush last year, citing concerns that it hindered US economic growth. The talks highlight the differing approaches to addressing climate change, with the US favoring voluntary limits and Japan committed to the Kyoto protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
