SUMMARY:

Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two-day climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting was the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was rejected by President Bush last year, citing concerns over US economic growth.

The talks come amid international controversy over the US's stance on climate change. Despite the differing approaches, the US and Japan aim to work together to address the issue. The outcome of the meeting is seen as a step towards greater cooperation between the two nations on climate change.
