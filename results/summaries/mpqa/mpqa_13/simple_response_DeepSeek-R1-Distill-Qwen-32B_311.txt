Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a provided news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. 

First, I need to understand the article. It's about US-Japan climate talks ending in Tokyo. They discussed cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The key points are that this was the first meeting since Bush's new US plan, which uses voluntary limits based on economic growth instead of mandatory targets. The US promoted R&D into climate change, while Japan plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused international outcry, citing hindrance to US economic growth.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also emphasized preserving the moral framing. So, I need to highlight the moral aspects, such as Bush's decision causing international outcry and the differing approaches between the US and Japan on climate policies.

I should structure the summary to include the key events: the talks ending, the topics discussed, the context of Bush's new plan, the US's R&D promotion, Japan's intent to ratify Kyoto, and the moral critique of Bush's stance. I need to ensure the summary is concise but covers all these points, maintaining the moral critique as presented in the original text.

I'll start by mentioning the conclusion of the talks, then the context of Bush's plan, the US's R&D promotion, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and end with the international reaction to Bush's decision. Keeping each sentence focused to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft this out, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is evident. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Once done, I'll format it correctly with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo, with representatives discussing cooperation in science and technology to address global warming. This was the first meeting since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas emission limits tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international outcry, as it was seen as prioritizing US economic growth over global climate efforts. The talks highlighted divergent approaches to climate policy between the two nations. END OF SUMMARY.
