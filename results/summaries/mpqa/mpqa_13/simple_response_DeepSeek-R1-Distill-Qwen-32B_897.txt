Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about US-Japan climate talks ending in Tokyo. They discussed cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US mentioned promoting R&D, while Japan plans to ratify the Kyoto protocol. President Bush rejected Kyoto last year, causing international outcry because it hindered US economic growth.

I should make sure the summary captures the key points: who, what, when, where. Also, highlight the moral aspects, like the US's shift to voluntary limits and Japan's stance on Kyoto. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Maybe start with the conclusion of the talks, then the topics discussed, the US's new plan, Japan's position, and Bush's rejection of Kyoto. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise but informative. Let me draft that and check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo after two days, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. The discussions marked the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan emphasizing voluntary greenhouse gas limits tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US highlighted its commitment to promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international criticism, as it was seen as prioritizing US economic growth over global climate efforts. The talks highlighted divergent approaches to addressing climate change between the two nations. END OF SUMMARY.
