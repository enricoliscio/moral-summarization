SUMMARY:

The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting marks the first since President Bush announced a new US plan, which prioritizes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth over mandatory targets. The US has committed to promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirms its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. This development is notable given President Bush's controversial rejection of the Kyoto protocol last year, citing concerns over US economic growth. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the US's prioritization of economic growth over environmental responsibility is at odds with Japan's commitment to international cooperation and climate action. The US's stance raises questions about its willingness to take responsibility for its role in contributing to global warming.
