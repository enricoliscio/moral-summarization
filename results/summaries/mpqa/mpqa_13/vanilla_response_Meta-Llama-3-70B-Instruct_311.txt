SUMMARY:

Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two days of climate change talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting was the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was rejected by President Bush last year, citing concerns over US economic growth. The US-Japan talks aimed to find common ground on addressing climate change, despite their differing approaches.
