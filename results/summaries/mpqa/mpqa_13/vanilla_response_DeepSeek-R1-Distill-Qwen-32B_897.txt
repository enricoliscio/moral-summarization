Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about US-Japan climate talks. Let me read through it carefully.

The article says that representatives from Japan and the US finished two days of talks in Tokyo on Tuesday. They discussed cooperating in science and tech to prevent global warming. This was the first meeting since President Bush introduced a new plan. His plan uses voluntary limits on greenhouse gases based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. At the start, the US said they'd promote R&D in climate change. Japan still plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected Kyoto last year, causing international outcry, saying it hurt US economic growth.

Okay, so the main points are: the talks happened, topics were cooperation in science/tech to fight global warming. It's the first meeting after Bush's new plan, which is voluntary. US is promoting R&D. Japan is sticking with Kyoto, while Bush rejected it, causing a stir.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words, starts with SUMMARY: and ends with END OF SUMMARY. I'll structure it to include the key elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the implications.

Maybe start with the conclusion of the talks, mention the topics, the context of Bush's plan, US's R&D promotion, Japan's Kyoto stance, and Bush's rejection leading to outcry.

I should keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed. Let me piece it together.

SUMMARY: US and Japanese representatives concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on science and technology cooperation to combat global warming. This was the first meeting since President George Bush introduced a new plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits tied to economic growth over mandatory targets. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international criticism, as it was seen as hindering US economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
