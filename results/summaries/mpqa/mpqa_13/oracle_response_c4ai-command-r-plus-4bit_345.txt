SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States engaged in discussions on climate change, aiming to prevent global warming through cooperation in science and technology. The talks lasted for two days and marked the first meeting between the two nations since the unveiling of the controversial US plan proposed by President George Bush. This plan advocated for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth instead of mandatory targets. While the US committed to promoting research and development in the area of climate change, Japan affirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, a decision that sparked international debate when rejected by President Bush as a hindrance to US economic growth. The discussions highlighted the differing approaches and priorities of the two nations in addressing the pressing issue of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
