* outcry
* rejected
* voluntary
* mandatory

SUMMARY: There was an international outcry when President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto protocol on climate change, choosing instead to unveil a new US plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. Representatives from Japan and the US held talks in Tokyo to discuss cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. Despite the US's rejection of the Kyoto protocol, Japan affirmed its intention to ratify the agreement. The US, however, emphasized its commitment to promoting research and development in the field of climate change. This demonstrates a moral tension between economic growth and the responsibility to address global environmental concerns, with the US prioritizing voluntary actions over mandatory obligations. END OF SUMMARY.
