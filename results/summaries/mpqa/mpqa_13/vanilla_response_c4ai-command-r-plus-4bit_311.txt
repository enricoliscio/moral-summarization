SUMMARY: US and Japanese representatives met in Tokyo for two days of talks on climate change, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting followed the US's recent shift in policy, with President Bush rejecting the Kyoto protocol and proposing voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The US expressed its commitment to promoting research and development in this area. Japan, however, reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol despite the US's withdrawal. The US's new stance on climate change has sparked international controversy, with critics arguing that it prioritizes economic growth over global efforts to tackle climate change.
END OF SUMMARY.
