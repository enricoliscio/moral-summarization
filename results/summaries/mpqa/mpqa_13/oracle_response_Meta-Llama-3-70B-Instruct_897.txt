SUMMARY:

The US and Japan have concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperative efforts in science and technology to prevent global warming. This meeting marks the first between the two nations since President George Bush introduced a new US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The meeting comes after President Bush sparked international outrage by rejecting the 1997 Kyoto protocol, citing concerns that it would hinder US economic growth.
