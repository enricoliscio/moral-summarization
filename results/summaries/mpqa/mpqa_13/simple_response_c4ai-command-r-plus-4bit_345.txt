SUMMARY: In a blatant display of selfishness and disregard for global cooperation, US President George Bush rejected the Kyoto protocol on climate change, prioritizing economic growth over the planet's well-being. Refusing to commit to mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the US instead opted for voluntary limits, a decision that sparked international outrage. Despite this, Japan remained committed to the protocol, recognizing the importance of global collaboration to combat climate change. 

Representatives from both countries recently met in Tokyo for talks, with the US pledging to promote research and development in this critical area. While the US attempts to mask its irresponsible decision-making with vague promises of action, Japan stands firm in its ethical commitment to address climate change, refusing to sacrifice the future for short-sighted economic gains. The world deserves better than a superpower that shirks its responsibility; it's time for the US to reconsider its stance and join the global effort to protect our planet. 

END OF SUMMARY.
