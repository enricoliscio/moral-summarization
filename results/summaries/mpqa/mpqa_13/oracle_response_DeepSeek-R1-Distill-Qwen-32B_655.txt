Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about US-Japan climate talks. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, specifically using the words "prevent" and "promote" as the author did. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The talks happened in Tokyo, lasted two days, and focused on cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US mentioned promoting R&D, while Japan is still planning to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused international outcry because it was seen as hindering US economic growth.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes "prevent" and "promote." I should structure the summary to highlight the US's promotion of R&D and the aim to prevent global warming. Also, mention Japan's stance on Kyoto and the context of Bush's decision causing outcry.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft a few sentences that include the necessary moral terms and key points without getting too detailed. Make sure it flows well and covers all main aspects: the talks, the focus areas, the US and Japan's positions, and the background on Kyoto rejection.

SUMMARY: US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to prevent global warming. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The meeting followed President George Bush's announcement of a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits based on economic growth over mandatory targets, which drew international criticism when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. END OF SUMMARY.
