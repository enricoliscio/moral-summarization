SUMMARY: US and Japanese representatives met in Tokyo for two days of talks on climate change, specifically discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting comes after the US unveiled a new plan that calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, a departure from mandatory targets set by the Kyoto protocol. While the US promotes research and development in climate change, Japan affirms its commitment to ratifying the Kyoto protocol, which US President George Bush rejected in 2001. The US's new stance on emissions has caused an international controversy, with critics arguing that it prioritizes economic growth over environmental protection. The talks between the US and Japan aim to find common ground and strengthen collaboration despite their differing approaches to addressing climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
