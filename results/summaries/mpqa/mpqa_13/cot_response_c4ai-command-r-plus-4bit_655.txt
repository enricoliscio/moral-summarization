SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of discussions on climate change in Tokyo, seeking cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. These talks come after the US unveiled a new plan that favors voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth over mandatory targets. Despite the US's controversial rejection of the Kyoto protocol, which sparked an international outcry, Japan affirmed its commitment to ratifying the protocol. President Bush's decision to reject the protocol was based on concerns about hindering US economic growth. The US, however, has expressed intentions to promote research and development in the area of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
