SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States concluded two days of discussions on climate change in Tokyo, aiming to collaborate in science and technology to prevent global warming. The talks marked the first meeting since the US introduced a new plan, abandoning mandatory targets for greenhouse gas emissions in favor of voluntary limits tied to economic growth. Despite the US shift in approach, Japan remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto protocol. The US has responded by promoting research and development efforts to address climate change. President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol sparked international controversy, citing concerns about hindering US economic growth. The two nations are now exploring opportunities to promote innovative solutions and prevent the worsening impacts of climate change.
