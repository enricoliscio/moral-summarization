SUMMARY: Representatives from Japan and the United States held two days of talks in Tokyo on climate change, specifically discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting comes after the US unveiled a new plan that calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth. The US expressed its commitment to promoting research and development in this area. Despite the US rejection of the Kyoto protocol, Japan affirmed its intention to ratify the agreement. The US position on climate change, as outlined by President Bush, has caused controversy internationally as it prioritizes economic growth over mandatory emissions targets.
