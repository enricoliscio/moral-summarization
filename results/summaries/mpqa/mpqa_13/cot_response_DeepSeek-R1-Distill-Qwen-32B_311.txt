Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about US-Japan climate talks and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the task. They have two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms. 

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence to pick out words that carry moral implications. Words like "rejected," "international outcry," "hindered," "voluntary," "mandatory," "co-operating," "promote," "ratify," and "voluntary" stand out. These terms suggest judgment or evaluation, which is key for moral framing.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the talks, highlighting the moral aspects. I'll mention the talks ending, the topics discussed, the US's new plan, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and the backlash against Bush's decision. 

I should ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing without adding extra information. I'll structure it to first state the conclusion of the talks, then detail the discussions, the US's plan, Japan's commitment, and the international reaction. This way, the summary is both informative and retains the moral elements from the original text.

I also need to make sure I follow the formatting instructions: starting with "STEP 1:" for the identified words, each on a new line with an asterisk, and then the summary after "SUMMARY:" ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Keeping it clear and structured as per the user's request is important.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are included. Making sure the moral words are preserved accurately is crucial to meet the user's requirements.

### SUMMARY:  
US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo after two days of discussions on combating global warming through scientific and technological cooperation. The talks marked the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits tied to economic growth, rather than mandatory targets. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year sparked international outcry, as critics argued it hindered US economic growth. The talks highlighted diverging approaches to addressing climate change, with the US opting for voluntary measures and Japan remaining committed to the Kyoto framework.  
END OF SUMMARY.
