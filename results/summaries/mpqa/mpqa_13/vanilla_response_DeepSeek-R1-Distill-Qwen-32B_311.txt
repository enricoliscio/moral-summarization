Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the US-Japan climate talks. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that representatives from Japan and the US finished two days of talks in Tokyo on Tuesday. They were discussing ways to cooperate in science and technology to prevent global warming. This meeting was the first since President George Bush introduced a new US plan. That plan involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. 

At the start of the meeting, the US mentioned they would promote research and development in climate change. Japan, on the other hand, still intends to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush had rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, causing international outcry, as he felt it hindered US economic growth.

So, the main points are:
1. US-Japan climate talks concluded in Tokyo.
2. They discussed cooperation in science and tech for climate change.
3. It's the first meeting since Bush's new plan with voluntary emissions limits.
4. US will promote R&D in climate change.
5. Japan plans to ratify Kyoto Protocol.
6. Bush's rejection of Kyoto caused international issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it to flow logically: mention the talks, the topics discussed, the context of Bush's plan, the US's R&D promotion, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and the background of Bush's rejection.

I should also keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me draft it:

"US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This was the first meeting since President George Bush introduced a new plan focusing on voluntary greenhouse gas emission limits tied to economic growth. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had sparked international criticism, as it was seen as hindering US economic growth."

Let me check the word count. That should be around 100 words, so I can add more details if needed. Maybe include that the talks were the first since the plan was unveiled, and that the US is focusing on R&D as part of their strategy. Also, clarify that Japan is still committed to Kyoto despite the US's stance.

"US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This was the first meeting since President George Bush introduced a new plan focusing on voluntary greenhouse gas emission limits tied to economic growth. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had sparked international criticism, as it was seen as hindering US economic growth."

Yes, that covers all the points succinctly.
