SUMMARY:
Representatives from Japan and the US concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, discussing ways to cooperate on science and technology to prevent global warming. This meeting marked the first between the two countries since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan, which sparked an international outcry, calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US pledged to promote research and development into climate change, while Japan reiterated its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, which President Bush rejected last year, citing concerns that it would hinder US economic growth. The talks aimed to find common ground despite these differences. END OF SUMMARY.
