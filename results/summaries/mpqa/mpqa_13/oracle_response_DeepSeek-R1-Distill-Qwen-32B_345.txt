Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The author used "prevent" and "promote," so I should include those. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll identify the key points: US and Japan held climate talks, discussing cooperation in science and tech to prevent global warming. The US promoted R&D. Japan plans to ratify Kyoto. Bush rejected Kyoto, causing international outcry, citing economic growth.

I need to make sure the summary includes "prevent" and "promote." I'll structure it to mention the talks, their purpose, the US's promotion of R&D, Japan's stance on Kyoto, and Bush's rejection causing outcry.

Let me draft it: US and Japan held talks to prevent global warming, discussing science and tech cooperation. The US promoted R&D. Japan will ratify Kyoto. Bush's rejection caused outcry, citing economic growth.

That's concise and includes the moral words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

SUMMARY: US and Japan concluded two days of climate talks in Tokyo, focusing on ways to prevent global warming through cooperation in science and technology. The US emphasized promoting research and development in climate change, while Japan reaffirmed its intent to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The discussions followed President George Bush's announcement of a new US plan favoring voluntary greenhouse gas limits based on economic growth, a move that drew international criticism when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol last year. END OF SUMMARY.
