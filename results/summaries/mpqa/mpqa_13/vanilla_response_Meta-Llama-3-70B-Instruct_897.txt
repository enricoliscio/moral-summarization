SUMMARY:

Representatives from the US and Japan concluded two days of climate change talks in Tokyo, focusing on cooperation in science and technology to combat global warming. This meeting marks the first between the two nations since President George Bush announced a new US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. The US emphasized its commitment to promoting research and development in climate change. In contrast, Japan reaffirmed its intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol, which the US rejected last year citing concerns over hindering economic growth.

The talks come after President Bush's controversial decision to reject the 1997 Kyoto protocol, sparking international criticism. The outcome of these talks may indicate a shift in the US stance on climate change, but details of any agreements or compromises reached remain unclear.

END OF SUMMARY.
