Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report being criticized by many countries, including China. It mentions that the report is inaccurate and a distortion, which are key moral terms. 

I should note the specific criticisms: the report is seen as an interference in internal affairs. The article also points out human rights issues in the US, like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, poverty, and domestic violence. These are all morally charged points. 

The user wants the summary to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. I need to make sure to incorporate words like "inaccurate," "distortion," "interference," "violations," "torture," etc. 

I also need to mention that the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own issues, which is another moral critique. The example with Egypt and the change in criticism when the US's interests shift is important. 

Finally, the summary should end with the point that the report is fabricated and not convincing, leading to protests. I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism and condemnation from numerous countries, including China, for being inaccurate and a distortion of the truth. Many nations view the report as an interference in their internal affairs. The report has been accused of ignoring human rights violations within the US, such as a high murder rate, torture, wrongful convictions, poverty, and domestic violence. Critics argue that the US focuses on other countries while neglecting its own issues, and its evaluations often depend on political relations. For example, the US criticized Egypt for trying terrorists in military courts in 2000 but dropped such criticism in 2001 due to its own plans to do the same. The report is seen as fabricated and unconvincing, with many, including Americans, rejecting its allegations, such as those against Vietnam. END OF SUMMARY.
