Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report being criticized by many countries. The main points are that the report is inaccurate and seen as interference. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America are rejecting it, calling it a distortion. 

The article also mentions that China released a report criticizing human rights in the US, pointing out issues like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, child poverty, and domestic violence. It suggests that the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own problems. There's a point about the US report being politically motivated, especially regarding countries like North Korea and Iraq. Reuters noted that the US changed its stance on Egypt's military trials when it suited their interests.

Additionally, the article mentions that some Americans are criticizing their government's report, like Andrew Wells-Dang in The Washington Times, who defended Vietnam's religious freedom. The conclusion is that the US report is not credible and is facing strong criticism.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the criticism, then the issues highlighted by China, the political bias, examples from Reuters and The Washington Times, and the overall lack of credibility of the US report.
