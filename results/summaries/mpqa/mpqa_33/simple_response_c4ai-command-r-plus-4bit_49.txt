SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by countries worldwide for its inaccurate and biased content. The report, which evaluates the human rights practices of 190 countries, has been called a brazen distortion of the truth and an interference in the internal affairs of other nations. Many countries, including China, have released reports exposing human rights violations in the United States, such as a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. World analysts and media outlets have noted the hypocrisy and double standards of the US report, highlighting how its judgments are influenced by political interests and relations. For example, the US criticized Egypt in its 2000 report for trying suspected terrorists in military courts, but omitted a similar criticism in its 2001 report as it plans to try al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees in the same manner. The US report also faced strong criticism from Americans, who provided evidence of the report's incorrect judgments, particularly regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The overall reaction to the US report underscores the international community's rejection of its moral authority on human rights due to its selective and self-serving application.
