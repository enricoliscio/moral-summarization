Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that many countries have criticized the US report, calling it inaccurate and an interference in their internal affairs. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America are rejecting it. China responded by releasing their own report criticizing human rights in the US, pointing out issues like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, and poverty. The US has been preparing these reports for 25 years but ignores its own issues. Analysts say the US evaluates other countries based on political relations and interests. For example, Egypt was criticized in 2000 but not in 2001 because the US was planning to use military courts. The article also mentions that some Americans are defending other countries, like Vietnam, saying religious freedom exists there. The US report is seen as inaccurate and fabricated.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the criticism from many countries, then China's response with their own report highlighting US issues. I'll note the US has been producing these reports without addressing their own problems. The political bias and examples like Egypt and Vietnam should be included. Finally, conclude that the report is inaccurate and facing strong criticism.

Let me structure this step by step. First, the global criticism. Then China's counter-report. The US's 25-year practice and ignoring domestic issues. The political bias and examples. The US report's lack of credibility. Make sure it's concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism from many countries, which accuse it of being inaccurate, biased, and an interference in internal affairs. Countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report, calling it a distortion of facts. In response, China released a report criticizing human rights issues in the US, highlighting high crime rates, torture, wrongful convictions, and poverty. The report also noted that over 12 million children live below the poverty line and that domestic violence is prevalent. Analysts suggest the US evaluates human rights in other countries based on political relations and interests, as seen in its inconsistent treatment of Egypt and its handling of terrorism suspects. The report's credibility is further questioned, with some Americans defending other nations, such as Vietnam, where religious freedom is emphasized. The US report is widely seen as inaccurate and fabricated, leading to global protests. END OF SUMMARY.
