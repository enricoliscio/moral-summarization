SUMMARY: The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has faced strong criticism and condemnation from numerous countries for its inaccurate and biased content. Many nations in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report, denouncing it as a distorted and illegitimate interference in their internal affairs. The report has been criticized for its selective evaluation of human rights practices, with countries' political relations with the US seemingly influencing the judgment. The US report overlooks human rights violations in its own country, such as a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty among children. Meanwhile, the US has been criticized for its selective acknowledgment of human rights issues, only speaking out when it serves their political purposes. The report has been further discredited by Americans providing evidence of the administration's wrongful judgment of human rights situations in other countries, particularly Vietnam. The report's allegations of religious freedom restrictions in Vietnam have been refuted by firsthand accounts. The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies and biased framing. Countries worldwide have condemned the report as a brazen interference in their internal affairs and a distortion of the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
