SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism and condemnation from numerous countries for its inaccurate and biased content. The report, which has been publicly available for 10 days, continues to be scrutinized by the global media for its lack of good faith and factual inaccuracies. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report's claims, denouncing it as a blatant distortion of the truth and an illegitimate interference in their internal affairs. The report's credibility is further questioned as it ignores the human rights violations within the United States, which have been highlighted by a report from the Information Office of the Chinese People's Congress. The Chinese report exposes issues such as a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty in the United States. The world analysts and the British News Agency Reuters also criticized the report's selective judgment of human rights practices based on political interests and relations. The strong protest and criticism directed at the US report expose its malicious intent and inaccurate assessment of human rights situations in other countries, particularly in Vietnam, as evidenced by the testimony of Americans and reports in the Washington Times. The US report's failure to address its own human rights violations while condemning others highlights its hypocrisy and lack of credibility.
