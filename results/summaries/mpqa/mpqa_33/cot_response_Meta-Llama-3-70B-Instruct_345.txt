SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly condemned by many countries, who reject its contents as inaccurate and lacking good will. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and unjust legal system. The report also notes that the US has been ignoring its own human rights issues for years, while criticizing other countries. The US evaluation of human rights in other countries is seen as dependent on political relations and US interests. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report's inaccuracies, particularly with regards to Vietnam. The report is widely seen as malicious, wrong, and fabricated. END OF SUMMARY.
