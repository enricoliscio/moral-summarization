SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized by countries around the world for its inaccurate and biased content. Many countries have rejected the report's assessment of their human rights situation, calling it a distortion of the truth and an interference in their internal affairs. The report has also been criticized for ignoring human rights violations in the United States, such as a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. A report on human rights violations in the US released by the Chinese People's Congress highlights these issues, including the frequent occurrence of domestic violence. The US report's selective criticism of other countries' human rights practices, based on political relations and interests, has been noted by world analysts and news agencies alike. This year's report has faced particularly strong backlash for its biased assessment of human rights in countries like North Korea and Iraq, while ignoring similar issues in the US. Additionally, the report's allegations of human rights violations in Vietnam have been refuted by American representatives. The overall sentiment is that the US State Department's report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies and biased nature.
