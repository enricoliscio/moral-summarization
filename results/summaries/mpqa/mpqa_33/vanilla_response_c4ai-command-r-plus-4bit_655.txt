SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized by countries around the world for its inaccurate and biased assessment of human rights practices in other nations. The report has been called a brazen distortion of the truth and an interference in internal affairs. In response, the Chinese People's Congress released a report on human rights violations in the US, highlighting issues such as a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The US has been accused of ignoring human rights violations at home while scrutinizing other countries. Analysts and news agencies have noted that the US report's judgments are influenced by political relations and interests. Protests and criticism have also come from Americans, who argue that the report misrepresents the situation in countries like Vietnam. An article in the Washington Times refuted the report's claims about religious freedom in Vietnam. The US State Department's report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies and bias.
END OF SUMMARY.
