SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and biased content. The report has been accused of distorting the situation in other countries, interfering in their internal affairs, and serving as a tool for the US to advance its political interests. In response, the Chinese People's Congress released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also pointed out the hypocrisy of the US, which has been ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing other countries. World analysts have noted that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on its political relations with them. The report's bias and inaccuracies have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world, with many Americans also speaking out against the report's wrong judgments.
