Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report being criticized by many countries. It mentions that the report is inaccurate and a distortion. Countries in various continents are rejecting it, calling it an interference in their internal affairs. 

The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing the US for human rights violations, citing high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, poverty, and domestic violence. The article also points out that the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own issues, and that their evaluations are politically motivated. 

Reuters noted that the US changed its stance on Egypt, which shows that their criticism depends on their interests. The report is fabricated and inaccurate, leading to strong protests. Some Americans, like Andrew Welsdan, refute the claims against Vietnam, stating that religious freedom exists there.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral words provided. I'll structure it by first mentioning the criticism of the report, then the specific criticisms from China, the US's hypocrisy, the political motives, and the lack of credibility in the report.

I should ensure that words like inaccurate, distortion, interference, violations, torture, etc., are included. I'll make sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism and condemnation from many countries, accused of being inaccurate and a distortion of reality. Nations across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report, calling it an interference in their internal affairs. The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing human rights violations in the US, citing high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, poverty, and domestic violence. The report highlights that the US has ignored its own human rights issues while scrutinizing others. Analysts note that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries often depends on political relations, with this year's report focusing on countries like North Korea and Iraq. The British News Agency Reuters pointed out that the US criticism of Egypt for trying terrorists in military courts was absent in 2001, despite planning similar trials for al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees. The report is seen as fabricated and lacking credibility, with many questioning its judgment and allegations. Some Americans, like Andrew Welsdan, have refuted claims against Vietnam, emphasizing religious freedom there. The US report is facing global protests for its hypocrisy and selective attention to human rights, often serving political purposes. END OF SUMMARY.
