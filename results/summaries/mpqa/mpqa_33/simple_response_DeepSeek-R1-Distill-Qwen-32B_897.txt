Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of the US State Department's Human Rights Report. It mentions that many countries, including China, have condemned the report as inaccurate and an interference in internal affairs. The Chinese report points out issues like high murder rates, torture, poverty, and gender-based violence in the US. Also, the article notes that the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own problems and political motives behind the reports. I should highlight the hypocrisy and selectivity in the US approach. I'll make sure to include the main points: criticism from multiple countries, specific US human rights issues, the US's selective reporting, and the lack of credibility in their report. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and maintaining the moral tone that the US is being hypocritical.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism from numerous countries, including China, which accuses it of being inaccurate, biased, and an interference in internal affairs. The report, which has been published for 25 years, is seen as hypocritical, as the US focuses on criticizing other nations while ignoring its own human rights issues, such as high murder rates, torture, poverty, and gender-based violence. Analysts note that the US's evaluation of human rights in other countries often reflects political interests, with selective attention to certain nations like North Korea and Iraq. The report's credibility is further undermined by its inconsistencies, such as omitting criticism of Egypt's military trials while planning similar trials for al-Qaeda detainees. Many, including Americans, argue that the report's purpose is not to promote human rights but to serve political agendas, leading to widespread condemnation and a lack of trust in its findings. END OF SUMMARY.
