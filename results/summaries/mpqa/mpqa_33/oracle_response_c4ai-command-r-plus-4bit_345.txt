SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by many countries for its inaccurate and distorted portrayal of human rights situations in other nations. The report has been called an interference in the internal affairs of other countries, with many nations in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America condemning its content. The report's selective criticism and disregard for the human rights violations within the United States, including a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty, have been highlighted by the world media. The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing human rights violations in the US, including the frequent occurrence of women being beaten. The US report's evaluation of human rights practices in other countries is seen as dependent on political relations and self-interest, with countries like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iraq receiving disproportionate attention. The US has been accused of ignoring its own human rights issues while preparing reports on other nations. Americans have also provided evidence contradicting the report's allegations, particularly regarding religious freedom in Vietnam. The report's lack of credibility and accuracy has led to strong protests and criticism from around the world.
