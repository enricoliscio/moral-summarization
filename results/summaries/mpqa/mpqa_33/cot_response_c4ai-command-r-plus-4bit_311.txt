SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced significant backlash and condemnation from countries worldwide for its inaccurate and biased content. Many nations have refuted the report's claims, deeming it a distorted and illegitimate interference in their internal affairs. The report's selective evaluation of human rights practices, based on political relations and interests, has been exposed by analysts and media outlets alike. The report's criticism of other countries' human rights records contrasts starkly with its own human rights violations, as detailed in a report by the Chinese People's Congress. The US report's credibility is further undermined by the testimony of Americans and organizations refuting its allegations, particularly regarding religious freedom in Vietnam. The US report is criticized for being inaccurate, fabricated, and lacking in moral legitimacy. END OF SUMMARY.
