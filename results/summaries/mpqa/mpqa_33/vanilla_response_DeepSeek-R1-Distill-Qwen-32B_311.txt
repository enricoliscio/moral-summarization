Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report. The article mentions that many countries have criticized the report for being inaccurate and biased. I should note that these criticisms come from various regions like Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. 

The report itself is said to distort the situation and interfere in other countries' affairs. It's important to highlight that China has released a counter-report pointing out human rights issues in the US, such as high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, and poverty. 

The article also discusses how the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own problems. There's a point about the US using the report to serve political interests, like criticizing Egypt one year and then not the next because of changing relations. 

Additionally, the report's credibility is questioned because it's seen as inaccurate and fabricated. Some Americans have even criticized their own government's report, especially regarding Vietnam, where religious freedom is highlighted. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the criticism, then the content of the US report, followed by the counter-arguments and the underlying issues with the report's credibility and bias.
