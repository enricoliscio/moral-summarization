SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and biased content. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and serving US political interests. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also pointed out the hypocrisy of the US, which has been ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on its political relations with them. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report's inaccuracies, including a representative of the US Fund for Reconciliation and Development who rejected the report's allegations against Vietnam. The report's malicious goals and biased content have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world.
