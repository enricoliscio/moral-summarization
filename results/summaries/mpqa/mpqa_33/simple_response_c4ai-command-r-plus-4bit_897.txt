SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by countries worldwide for its inaccuracy and interference in internal affairs. The report, which critiques human rights practices in other countries, has been exposed as a tool to serve US political interests and ignore violations within the United States. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have denounced the report as a distortion of the truth and an illegitimate interference in their internal affairs. The report's credibility is further undermined by the release of a report by the Chinese People's Congress, exposing human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and the sentencing of innocent people to death. Even Americans have provided evidence against their administration's wrong judgment, especially regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The US report's bias and lack of objectivity are evident in its selective criticism, as pointed out by the British News Agency Reuters. The world strongly protests and criticizes the US report for its malicious intent and disregard for fundamental human rights.
