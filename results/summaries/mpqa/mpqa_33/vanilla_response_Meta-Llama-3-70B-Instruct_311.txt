SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries. The report has been accused of being inaccurate, lacking good will, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also pointed out that the US has been ignoring its own human rights issues while criticizing others. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and US interests. The report has been accused of being hypocritical, with the US criticizing other countries for practices it is planning to adopt itself. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report, rejecting its allegations of human rights abuses in countries like Vietnam. Overall, the report has been deemed unconvincing and fabricated.
