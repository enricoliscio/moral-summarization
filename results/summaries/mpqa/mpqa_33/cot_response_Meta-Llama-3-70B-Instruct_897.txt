SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and malicious contents. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. The report also pointed out that many people have been sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit due to an unjust legal system. The US has been accused of ignoring human rights violations at home while preparing reports on other countries. World analysts remark that the US evaluation of human rights depends on political relations and US interests. The report is facing strong protest and criticism from the world, with many Americans rejecting its allegations. The report is deemed unconvincing, inaccurate, and fabricated. END OF SUMMARY.
