SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by countries worldwide for its inaccurate and distorted portrayal of human rights situations in other nations. Many countries have called out the report as an interference in their internal affairs, with some highlighting the hypocrisy of the United States' own human rights violations, such as torture and an unjust legal system. The report's selective criticism, depending on political relations and interests, has been exposed by analysts and news agencies alike. The report's allegations and judgments are not supported by evidence, and it ignores the real human rights issues within the United States itself. The report's inaccuracy and bias have been further highlighted by Americans providing evidence of the wrong judgment of their administration, especially regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The report's lack of credibility and fabrication of information have led to strong protests and criticism from the international community.
