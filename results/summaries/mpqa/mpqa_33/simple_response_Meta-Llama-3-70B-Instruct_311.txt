SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries, who deem it inaccurate and lacking good will. The report's bias is evident in its selective criticism of human rights practices in other countries, while ignoring its own violations. A report by the Chinese People's Congress highlights the US's own human rights issues, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The US report is seen as an interference in internal affairs and a tool to serve US political interests. Analysts point out that the US evaluation of human rights practices depends on its political relations with other countries. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report's inaccuracies, particularly regarding Vietnam. The report's credibility is undermined by its fabrications and lack of attention to fundamental human rights unless they serve US interests.
