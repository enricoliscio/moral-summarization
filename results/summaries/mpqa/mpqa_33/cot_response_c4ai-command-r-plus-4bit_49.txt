SUMMARY:
The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has faced strong criticism and condemnation from numerous countries for its inaccurate content and malicious intentions. Many countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report, calling it a brazen distortion of the truth and an illegitimate interference in their internal affairs. The report's selective criticism and double standards have been exposed, with the US ignoring its own human rights violations while judging other countries based on its political interests. For example, the US criticized Egypt in its 2000 report for trying suspected terrorists in military courts, yet it plans to do the same with al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees. The US report also ignores the daily human rights violations in the US, such as torture, an unjust legal system, and violence against women. The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing the US for these violations, citing data from reputable sources. Americans have also spoken out against the report, providing evidence of its wrong judgment, especially regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The Washington Times published an article refuting the allegations of human rights violations in Vietnam. The US State Department's report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies and fabricated content. END OF SUMMARY.
