Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of the US State Department's Human Rights Report. It mentions that many countries, including China, have condemned the report as inaccurate and biased. The Chinese report points out issues like high crime rates, torture, poverty, and gender-based violence in the US. The article also notes that the US tends to focus on countries with which it has poor relations, suggesting a political motive behind the reports. Additionally, it highlights that the US has changed its stance on Egypt, which aligns with its own interests. The summary should capture these points succinctly, emphasizing the criticism of the US report's credibility and its underlying political motives.
