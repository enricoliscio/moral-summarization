SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been criticized and rejected by many countries for its inaccuracy and interference in internal affairs. The report has been called a brazen distortion of the human rights situation in other countries. The Chinese People's Congress released a report on human rights violations in the US, highlighting issues such as a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. World analysts and news agencies have noted the US report's bias and double standards, with criticism depending on political relations and interests. An article in the Washington Times also refuted the report's allegation of human rights violations in Vietnam. The US report is seen as lacking credibility due to its inaccuracies and bias. Many Americans have provided evidence that contradicts the report's claims.
END OF SUMMARY.
