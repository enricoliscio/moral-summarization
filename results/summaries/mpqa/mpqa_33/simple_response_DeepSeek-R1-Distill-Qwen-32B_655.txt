Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article talks about the US State Department's Human Rights Report being criticized by many countries. It mentions that the report is inaccurate and lacks goodwill, leading to worldwide condemnation. Countries from various continents are rejecting it, calling it a distortion and interference in internal affairs.

The article also points out that China released a report criticizing human rights issues in the US, like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, child poverty, and domestic violence. It highlights that the US focuses on other countries while ignoring its own problems and uses political relations to evaluate human rights.

I should make sure the summary includes these points: the US report's criticism, the reasons given (inaccuracy, interference), examples of countries opposing it, the counter-report from China with specific US issues, and the critique that the US uses the report for political purposes, not genuine human rights concerns.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective presented in the original text. Let me structure it to first mention the criticism, then the reasons, followed by the counterpoints from China and others, and conclude with the political angle.

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has faced strong criticism and condemnation from numerous countries, including China, which released its own report highlighting human rights issues in the US, such as high crime rates, torture, wrongful convictions, child poverty, and domestic violence. The report is accused of being inaccurate, biased, and a tool for political interference, with critics pointing out that the US often ignores its own human rights problems while scrutinizing others. The report's credibility is further undermined by its selective focus on certain countries based on political interests, such as criticizing Egypt in 2000 but omitting similar criticisms in 2001 due to changing US priorities. Many argue that the report serves political purposes rather than promoting genuine human rights, leading to widespread protests and accusations of hypocrisy. END OF SUMMARY.
