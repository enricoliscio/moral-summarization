SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized by many countries, who claim it is inaccurate and lacks good will. The report has been accused of distorting the situation in other countries and interfering in their internal affairs. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also pointed out that the US ignores its own human rights issues while criticizing others. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and US interests. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report, citing inaccuracies and biases. The report's credibility has been questioned, with some calling it "inaccurate" and "fabricated".
