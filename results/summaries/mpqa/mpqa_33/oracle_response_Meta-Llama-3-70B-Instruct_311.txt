SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and distorted contents. The report's brazen interference in the internal affairs of other countries has been rejected by nations in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. The report also noted that many people have been sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit due to an unjust legal system. Furthermore, over 12 million children live below the poverty line, and one American woman is beaten every 15 seconds. The US has been ignoring its own human rights violations for years, while preparing reports on 190 other countries. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights depends on political relations and serves its own interests. The report's malicious goals have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world.
