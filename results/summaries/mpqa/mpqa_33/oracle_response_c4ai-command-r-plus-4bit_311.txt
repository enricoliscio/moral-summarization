SUMMARY: The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and rejected by numerous countries worldwide. The report, which has been described as inaccurate and lacking good will, distorts the human rights situation in other nations and interferes in their internal affairs. Many countries have called out the United States for its hypocrisy and double standards in evaluating human rights practices, with its judgments seemingly based on political interests and relations. The report has faced strong condemnation, with evidence highlighting human rights violations within the United States itself, including a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty. The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing human rights violations in the US, while Americans have also provided evidence of their administration's wrong judgment, especially regarding Vietnam. The Washington Times published an article refuting the report's allegations, emphasizing religious freedom in Vietnam. The US report's inaccuracy and fabrication have led to its lack of credibility. The selective attention paid to human rights by the United States, ignoring its own issues while scrutinizing others, has sparked protests and criticism from around the globe.
