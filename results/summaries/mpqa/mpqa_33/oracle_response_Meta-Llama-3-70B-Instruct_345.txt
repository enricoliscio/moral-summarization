SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and distorted contents. The report is seen as a wrongful and illegitimate move, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, the Chinese People's Congress released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. The report also noted that many people have been sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit, and over 12 million children live below the poverty line. Furthermore, the US has been accused of ignoring human rights violations at home while criticizing other countries. The report's judgment of human rights practices in other countries is seen as dependent on US political interests, and its criticism of other countries is often hypocritical. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report's allegations, calling them inaccurate and fabricated. END OF SUMMARY.
