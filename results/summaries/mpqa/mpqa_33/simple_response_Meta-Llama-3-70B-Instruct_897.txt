SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and biased content. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, an illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report suggests that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and US interests. Many have rejected the report, citing its hypocrisy and malicious goals. Even Americans have spoken out against the report's inaccuracies, including a representative from the US Fund for Reconciliation and Development who disputed the report's allegations on Vietnam. The report's lack of credibility and fabricated content have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world.
