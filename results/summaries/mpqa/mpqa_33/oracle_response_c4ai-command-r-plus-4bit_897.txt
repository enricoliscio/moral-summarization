SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by countries around the world for its inaccurate and distorted portrayal of human rights situations in other nations. The report has been called an interference in the internal affairs of other countries and a move that serves the political purposes of the United States. Many countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have condemned the report, highlighting its brazen distortion of facts and illegitimate criticism. The report has been further discredited by evidence of widespread human rights violations in the United States itself, including a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty. The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing human rights violations in the US, including the frequent occurrence of women being beaten. The US report's selective criticism of countries like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iraq, while ignoring its own human rights issues, has been denounced. Americans have also spoken out against the report's false judgment of human rights in other nations, particularly Vietnam. An article in the Washington Times refuted the report's allegations, emphasizing religious freedom in Vietnam. The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies and fabricated content.
