SUMMARY: The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by numerous countries and the world media for its inaccuracy and bias. Many countries have rejected the report's content, calling it a distortion of the truth and an interference in their internal affairs. The report's credibility is further questioned by a report on human rights violations in the United States released by the Chinese People's Congress, highlighting issues such as a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The United States' selective evaluation of human rights practices in other countries based on political relations and self-interest is also criticized, with the example of the double standard applied to Egypt in the 2000 and 2001 reports. Americans themselves have provided evidence against their administration's wrong judgment, particularly regarding Vietnam. An article in the Washington Times refutes the report's allegation of human rights violations in Vietnam, emphasizing religious freedom in the country. The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report lacks credibility due to its inaccuracies, bias, and selective application of human rights standards.
