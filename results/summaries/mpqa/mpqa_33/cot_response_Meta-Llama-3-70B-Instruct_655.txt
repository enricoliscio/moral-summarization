SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and malicious content. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also criticized the US for ignoring its own human rights issues while judging others. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and US interests. Many Americans have rejected the report's allegations, calling them wrong and fabricated. The report's credibility is under fire, and its malicious goals have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world.
