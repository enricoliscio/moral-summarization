SUMMARY: The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by numerous countries and the world media for its inaccuracy and bias. Many countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the report's content, calling it a brazen distortion of the truth and an interference in their internal affairs. The report's credibility is further undermined by the release of a report by the Chinese People's Congress, which exposes human rights violations in the United States, including a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and poverty. The United States' own human rights violations are often ignored, while its evaluation of other countries is based on political relations and self-interest. This hypocrisy is highlighted by the absence of criticism for Egypt in the 2001 report, despite the United States' own plans to try suspected terrorists in military courts. Americans themselves have provided evidence of the report's wrong judgment, particularly regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The overall sentiment is that the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report lacks credibility due to its inaccurate, biased, and politically motivated nature.
