SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and distorted contents. The report has been accused of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and ignoring the real human rights situation in the US. In response, China released a report highlighting the US's own human rights violations, including a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. The report also pointed out that many people have been sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit due to an unjust legal system. Moreover, over 12 million children live below the poverty line, and one American woman is beaten every 15 seconds. The report suggests that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and serves its own interests. Many Americans have also spoken out against the report's allegations, calling them fabricated and inaccurate. The report's malicious goals have sparked strong protests and criticism from around the world.
