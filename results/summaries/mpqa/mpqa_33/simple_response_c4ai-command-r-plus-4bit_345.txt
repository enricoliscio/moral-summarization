SUMMARY: The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by various countries and the world media for its inaccurate and biased content. Many countries have rejected the report's portrayal of the human rights situation in their nations, viewing it as a distortion of the truth and an interference in their internal affairs. The report's credibility is further questioned by a report released by the Chinese People's Congress, which exposes human rights violations in the United States, including a high murder rate, torture, and the injustice of the legal system. The United States' own human rights violations are often ignored, while its evaluation of other countries is seen as politically motivated and serving its own interests. This hypocrisy is evident in the inconsistent criticism of Egypt's use of military courts, which the US plans to employ itself. The report faces strong criticism and evidence-backed refutations from Americans and the world, highlighting the wrongful judgment of the US administration against other countries, particularly Vietnam, where religious freedom exists contrary to the report's claims.
