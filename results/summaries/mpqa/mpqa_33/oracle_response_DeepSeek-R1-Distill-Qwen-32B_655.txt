Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report being criticized by many countries. It mentions that the report is inaccurate and lacks goodwill. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America are rejecting it, calling it a distortion and interference in their internal affairs. 

The Chinese People's Congress released a report criticizing human rights in the US, pointing out issues like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, poverty, and domestic violence. They argue that the US focuses on other countries' human rights while ignoring their own problems. 

The article also mentions that the US report's criticism of other countries depends on political relations. For example, Egypt was criticized in 2000 but not in 2001 when the US planned similar actions. This shows the US is selective and uses human rights as a political tool. 

Some Americans are speaking out against the report, like Andrew Welsdon, who defends Vietnam's religious freedom. The article concludes that the US report is inaccurate and fabricated, leading to strong global criticism.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the criticism, inaccuracies, interference, and the hypocrisy of the US focusing on others while ignoring their own issues. I'll make sure to mention the specific criticisms and the examples given, like the murder rate, torture, poverty, and the change in Egypt's treatment. I'll also note the counterarguments from people like Welsdon and the overall lack of credibility in the US report.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key points and moral terms. I'll start by stating the criticism, then the US hypocrisy, the specific issues highlighted, the political bias, and the lack of credibility leading to protests. I'll end with the counterarguments and the fabricated nature of the report.
