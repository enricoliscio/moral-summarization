SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been criticized and condemned by countries worldwide for its inaccuracy and bias. Many countries have rejected its content, calling it a distortion of the truth and an interference in their internal affairs. The report has been criticized for ignoring human rights violations in the US while unfairly targeting other countries. A report on human rights violations in the US released by the Chinese People's Congress highlights issues such as a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. It also points out the injustice of the legal system and the high number of children living in poverty. The US administration's hypocrisy has been exposed, as it prepares reports on human rights in other countries while ignoring its own issues. Analysts and media outlets have noted the US report's bias, with countries' evaluations depending on political relations and the US's own interests. Protests and criticism from both within and outside the US have highlighted the report's flawed judgment, especially regarding Vietnam's religious freedom. The credibility of the US State Department's report is questioned due to its inaccuracies and fabrications.
