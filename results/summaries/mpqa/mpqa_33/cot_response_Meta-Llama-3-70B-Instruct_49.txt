SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly condemned and criticized by many countries for its inaccurate and malicious contents. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report also pointed out that the US has been ignoring its own human rights issues for years. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations and US interests. The report is facing strong protest and criticism from the world, with many Americans rejecting its allegations, calling them wrong and fabricated. The report's credibility is questioned, and its moral legitimacy is seen as lacking. END OF SUMMARY.
