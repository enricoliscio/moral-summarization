SUMMARY: The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and rejected by countries around the world for its inaccurate and distorted portrayal of human rights situations in other nations. Many countries have called out the report as an interference in their internal affairs, with a blatant disregard for the actual human rights violations occurring within the United States itself. The report has been described as lacking good will and serving the political purposes of the US. The Chinese People's Congress released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, an unjust legal system, and the prevalence of poverty and domestic violence. Americans themselves have provided evidence contradicting their administration's judgment, particularly regarding religious freedom in Vietnam. The report's allegations have been described as fabricated and lacking credibility. The selective criticism and double standards employed by the US in its evaluation of human rights practices in other countries have been exposed, with the report facing strong protest and criticism from the international community. This reveals the hypocrisy and self-serving nature of the US's assessment of human rights, which is influenced by its political interests and relations with other nations. END OF SUMMARY.
