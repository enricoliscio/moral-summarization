SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and distorted portrayal of human rights situations. The report has been accused of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and serving as a tool for the US to advance its political interests. In response, China has released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and pressure to confess crimes. The report also notes that many people have been sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit, and that over 12 million children live below the poverty line. The US has been accused of ignoring its own human rights violations while criticizing other countries. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights practices depends on its political relations with other countries. The report has been deemed "inaccurate" and "fabricated" by many, and its judgment has been rejected by countries around the world.
