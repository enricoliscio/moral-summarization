SUMMARY:
The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries for its inaccurate and malicious contents. The report is seen as a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, China released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, common torture, and unjust legal system. The report also pointed out that the US has been ignoring its own human rights violations for years. World analysts remarked that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries depends on political relations, and the report is not convincing due to its fabricated contents. Many Americans have also rejected the report's allegations, calling them wrong and inaccurate. END OF SUMMARY.
