SUMMARY:

The US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report has been widely criticized and condemned by many countries. The report has been accused of being inaccurate and biased, and is seen as an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In response, the Chinese People's Congress has released a report highlighting human rights violations in the US, including a high murder rate, torture, and poverty. The report suggests that the US ignores human rights violations at home while criticizing other countries. World analysts argue that the US evaluation of human rights in other countries is influenced by political relations and US interests. The report has been criticized for its hypocrisy, with many Americans speaking out against the report's inaccuracies, particularly regarding Vietnam. The report's credibility has been questioned, with many countries rejecting its contents.
