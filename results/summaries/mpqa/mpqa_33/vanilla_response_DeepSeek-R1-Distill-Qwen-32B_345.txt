Okay, I need to summarize this article about the US State Department's Annual Human Rights Report. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that many countries have criticized the report, calling it inaccurate and an interference in their internal affairs. Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America are rejecting it. China released a report criticizing human rights issues in the US, like high murder rates, torture, wrongful convictions, and poverty. The US has been ignoring its own problems while evaluating others for 25 years.

It also mentions that the US report's focus on countries like North Korea and Iraq is politically motivated. Reuters noted that the US changed its stance on Egypt's military trials when it suited their interests. The article concludes that the US report is facing strong criticism because it's seen as biased and serving political purposes, not genuine concern for human rights.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: international criticism, the US's own human rights issues, political bias in the report, and the lack of credibility. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well. Let me draft that.
