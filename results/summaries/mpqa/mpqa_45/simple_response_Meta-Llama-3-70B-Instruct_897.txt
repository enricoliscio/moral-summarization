SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect Suhakam's findings, particularly in the Kesas report, which found police guilty of excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The government has also failed to ratify international human rights instruments and has restricted democratic space. The NGOs are concerned about Suhakam's independence following the appointment of a new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners who produced the Kesas report. The boycott is seen as a moral imperative to hold the government accountable for its human rights record. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their position after 100 days.
