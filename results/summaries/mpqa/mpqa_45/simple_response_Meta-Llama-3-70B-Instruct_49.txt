SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect or recognize Suhakam's recommendations, including its maiden report and freedom of assembly report. They also expressed concern over the appointment of a new chairperson and commissioners, which they believe undermines Suhakam's independence. The NGOs will not hold dialogues, send memorandums, or complaints to Suhakam during the boycott period and will instead monitor the commissioners' performance. They stressed that Suhakam's performance will be judged on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not on the number of statements issued or reports produced. The NGOs will review their position after the 100-day period.
