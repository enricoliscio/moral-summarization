SUMMARY:

Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, effective April 24. The boycott is in protest of the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs claim that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of a new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, which they believe undermines Suhakam's independence. The boycott will be reviewed after 100 days, and the NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations.

END OF SUMMARY.
