Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about thirty-two NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government hasn't responded well to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights in Malaysia, citing issues like detentions without trial, restrictions on free speech, and more. They also criticize the recent appointments to Suhakam, saying they undermine its independence.

I should make sure to include the main points: the NGOs' boycott, their reasons (government ignoring Suhakam's reports, decline in human rights), concerns about the new appointments affecting independence, and the NGOs' intention to monitor Suhakam's performance.

I need to keep it under 200 words and in a formal tone. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to highlight the NGOs' actions and their moral stance against the government's handling of human rights.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights in Malaysia. They criticize the government for ignoring reports on freedom of assembly and excessive police force, and for failing to ratify key international human rights instruments. The NGOs also express concerns over recent Suhakam appointments, including the chairperson Abu Talib Othman, whose past actions raise doubts about his commitment to human rights. They argue that the removal of three commissioners signals a lack of independence for Suhakam. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and may reassess their stance after the boycott period. Suhakam Commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan disagrees, calling the boycott unfair and urging collaboration for human rights advancement. END OF SUMMARY.
