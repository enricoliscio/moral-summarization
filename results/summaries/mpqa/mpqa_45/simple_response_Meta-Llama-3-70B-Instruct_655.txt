SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect and recognize Suhakam's recommendations, which has led to a decline in human rights in Malaysia. They are also concerned about the controversial appointments to the commission, including the new chairperson, Abu Talib Othman, who has a questionable record on human rights. The NGOs believe that the appointments undermine the commission's independence and erode public confidence. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage with Suhakam and will instead monitor its performance. They will review their position after 100 days. The boycott is seen as a moral imperative to hold the government and Suhakam accountable for promoting and protecting human rights in Malaysia.
