SUMMARY:

Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect or recognize Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. They also expressed concern over the appointment of a new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, which they see as undermining the commission's independence. The NGOs will not hold dialogues, send memorandums, or complaints to Suhakam during the boycott period and will instead monitor the commission's performance. The boycott is seen as a response to the government's failure to adhere to universal human rights principles and the decline of human rights in Malaysia.

END OF SUMMARY.
