SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have suspended their engagement with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24, 2002. The boycott is a protest against the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs, led by human rights organization Hakam, criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report, while dismissing the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass gathering in 2000. They also lamented the government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations, giving the impression that Suhakam is merely a public relations tool. The NGOs further expressed concern over the controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson. They perceived that three commissioners were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favor, undermining the independence of the Commission. The NGOs questioned Abu Talib's commitment to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights, citing his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' and his role in the impeachment of the Lord President and Supreme Court judges in 1988. They also noted the government's failure to show commitment to universal human rights principles by ratifying key international covenants. During the boycott, the NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations. They will review their position after the 100-day period. Other notable NGOs involved include the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), Suaram, and Amnesty International's Malaysian chapter. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, calling it unfair and suggesting that the NGOs are acting out of self-interest. END OF SUMMARY.
