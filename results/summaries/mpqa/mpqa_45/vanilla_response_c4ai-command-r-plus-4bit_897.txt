SUMMARY: Thirty-two Malaysian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The boycott began on April 24, 2002, when controversial new appointments to the commission took effect. The NGOs, led by human rights organization Hakam, criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports and recommendations, including the Kesas report which found the police guilty of using excessive force during an anti-government gathering in 2000. They also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly and free speech, and restrictive amendments to election laws. The NGOs questioned the independence of Suhakam following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners who were instrumental in the Kesas report. They also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners, mostly retired civil servants, and doubted their ability to objectively assess executive policies impacting human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage with Suhakam but will monitor its performance and the government's compliance with Suhakam's recommendations. They will review their position after the 100-day period. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, saying that it was unfair and could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self-interest.
