Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is from May 4, 2002, and it's about thirty-two NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They started this boycott on April 24 when new appointments took effect. 

The main reason for the boycott is that the government hasn't responded well to Suhakam's recommendations. They mention that the government ignored Suhakam's reports, especially the Kesas report which was critical and led to the Prime Minister dismissing it as biased. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights in Malaysia, citing issues like detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly, free speech, and election laws. 

They also talk about the independence of Suhakam being compromised because of new appointments. The chairperson, Abu Talib, was a former attorney-general involved in controversial cases, and three commissioners were removed. The NGOs worry that this makes Suhakam less independent and trustworthy. 

The NGOs plan to monitor Suhakam's performance and will review their position after 100 days. Some commissioners, like Prof Hamdan Adnan, are disappointed with the boycott, thinking it's unfair and not in the spirit of collaboration for human rights.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the boycott, the reasons, the concerns about Suhakam's independence, and the NGOs' plan. I'll also mention the opposing views from Suhakam commissioners.

Let me structure it: first, the NGOs' action and reasons, then the concerns about Suhakam's independence, followed by the NGOs' plan and the commissioners' reactions. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear but brief.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's neglect of Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights. They criticize the government's dismissal of reports, including the Kesas report, and note issues like detentions without trial, restricted assembly, and free speech. Concerns over Suhakam's independence arise from controversial appointments, including former attorney-general Abu Talib, and the removal of three commissioners. NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their stance after the boycott. Suhakam commissioners, like Prof Hamdan Adnan, view the boycott as unfair and counterproductive. END OF SUMMARY.
