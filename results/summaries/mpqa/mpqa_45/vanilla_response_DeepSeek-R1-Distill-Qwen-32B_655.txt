Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is from May 4, 2002, and it's about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days starting April 24. The NGOs are protesting the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. 

Hakam's president, Ramdas Tikamdas, is speaking on behalf of the NGOs. They're concerned because the government ignored Suhakam's reports, especially the Kesas report which criticized the police for excessive force. The Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, dismissed this report as biased. 

The NGOs are pointing out that human rights in Malaysia have worsened, with more detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly and speech, and changes to election laws that limit democracy. They also mention the government hasn't ratified key international human rights covenants. 

Another issue is the recent appointments to Suhakam. Abu Talib Othman, a former attorney-general, was appointed as chair, and three commissioners were not renewed. The NGOs think this undermines Suhakam's independence because the new chair and commissioners might not be committed to human rights. They also express concern that the new commissioners are mostly retired civil servants who might not objectively assess government policies. 

The NGOs are boycotting by not engaging with Suhakam, not sending any memos or complaints, but they will monitor Suhakam's performance. They plan to meet after 100 days to review their stance. Suhakam's Prof Hamdan Adnan is disappointed, saying the boycott is unfair and that NGOs should work with Suhakam instead.

So, to summarize, the key points are: NGOs suspending work with Suhakam due to government inaction on recommendations, concerns about human rights decline, issues with Suhakam's independence due to appointments, and the NGOs' boycott and monitoring plan. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights. They criticized the government's inaction on reports, including the Kesas report, which was dismissed by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. NGOs highlighted worsening human rights, such as detentions under the ISA, assembly bans, and restrictive laws. They also expressed concern over Suhakam's independence due to controversial appointments, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chair, and the removal of three commissioners. The NGOs plan to monitor Suhakam's performance and will review their stance after 100 days. Suhakam's Prof Hamdan Adnan called the boycott "unfair," urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
