Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government has ignored Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights in Malaysia, citing issues like detentions without trial, police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws. They also criticize the recent appointments to Suhakam, questioning the independence of the commission.

I should start the summary by mentioning the NGOs' boycott, using words like "suspended" and "protest." Then, I'll note that the government has "ignored" and "dismissed" Suhakam's reports. The NGOs are worried about the "decline" in human rights and the "failure" to respect recommendations. I'll include the specific issues like "detained without trial," "ban on assemblies," and "restrictions on free speech." Also, the "amendments" to election laws have "denied" democratic space.

Next, I'll address the concerns about the new appointments to Suhakam, using words like "controversial," "independence," and "undermines." The NGOs are skeptical about the new chairperson and the retired civil servants on the commission, fearing they might not "objectively assess" policies. They also mention that the government hasn't "ratified" international human rights instruments, which is a "failure" to show commitment.

I should also include Suhakam's response, where a commissioner called the boycott "unfair" and suggested the NGOs are acting out of self-interest. This adds a counterpoint to the summary.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all key points and as many moral words as possible without making it too verbose. I'll structure it to first state the boycott, then the reasons, the concerns about appointments, and the counterpoint from Suhakam.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's failure to address its recommendations. They criticize the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, dismissing its findings, and failing to improve human rights. NGOs highlight the decline in rights, including detentions without trial, bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws, which have denied democratic space. They also express concern over Suhakam's independence, as three commissioners were axed, undermining its credibility. The appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson and retired civil servants as new commissioners raises fears of policy bias. NGOs stress the government's failure to ratify international human rights instruments, further eroding trust. Suhakam's performance will be judged by actual rights improvements, not just reports. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's compliance with recommendations and meet after 100 days to review their stance. Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan called the boycott unfair, urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
