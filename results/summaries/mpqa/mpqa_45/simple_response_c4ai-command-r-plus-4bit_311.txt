SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have boycotted the country's Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The boycott, led by human rights organization Hakam, highlights the government's failure to respect Suhakam's findings and act on its recommendations, particularly regarding the excessive use of force by police during a 2000 anti-government gathering. The NGOs also criticized the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments, seeing it as a threat to the commission's independence. They questioned Abu Talib's commitment to protecting civil liberties and raised concerns about the appointment of retired civil servants as commissioners. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage in dialogues or send complaints to Suhakam but will monitor the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with Suhakam's recommendations. They hope that Suhakam will prove itself as an institution dedicated to protecting and promoting human rights in Malaysia.
END OF SUMMARY.
