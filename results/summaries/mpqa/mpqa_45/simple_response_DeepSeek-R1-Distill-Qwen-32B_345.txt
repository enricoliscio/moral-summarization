Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government hasn't responded to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are upset because the government ignored Suhakam's reports, especially the Kesas report which criticized the police's use of excessive force. They feel Suhakam isn't independent anymore because of recent appointments, like Abu Talib Othman, who they see as not committed to human rights. Also, they're concerned about the new commissioners being mostly retired civil servants, which might affect their objectivity.

The NGOs are boycotting by not engaging with Suhakam, not sending any complaints or memos. They'll monitor Suhakam's performance and whether it improves human rights. They mention that human rights in Malaysia have deteriorated with more detentions, restrictions on assemblies, and free speech. They also point out the government hasn't ratified key international human rights covenants.

On the other side, Suhakam's Prof Hamdan Adnan is disappointed, saying the boycott is unfair and that NGOs should work with Suhakam instead of acting out of self-interest.

So, the main points are: NGOs boycotting Suhakam, government's lack of response to recommendations, concerns about Suhakam's independence, deteriorating human rights, and the government's failure to ratify international covenants.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing, which is the NGOs' perspective on the government's failure to uphold human rights and the loss of Suhakam's independence. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all key points without being too verbose. I'll mention the NGOs' boycott, their reasons, the impact on human rights, and the opposing viewpoint from Suhakam.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and its independence. They criticize the government's inaction on human rights issues, including detentions, assembly bans, and restrictions on free speech. NGOs are concerned about recent Suhakam appointments, such as Abu Talib Othman, who they view as not committed to human rights, and the dominance of retired civil servants on the commission, which may compromise objectivity. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and its impact on human rights, while Suhakam's Prof Hamdan Adnan calls the boycott unfair and urges collaboration. END OF SUMMARY.
