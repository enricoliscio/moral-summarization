SUMMARY:
A group of 32 NGOs have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) to protest the government's poor response to its recommendations. The NGOs expressed their deep concern that the government had ignored Suhakam's reports, particularly the Kesas report which found the police guilty of excessive force during an anti-government gathering. The Malaysian government has also failed to respect Suhakam's recommendations, leading to a deterioration of human rights in the country, with increasing numbers of people being detained without trial and restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech. The NGOs lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia and the government's failure to commit to universal human rights principles. They also raised concerns about the controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson, which undermines the commission's independence. The NGOs will not engage with Suhakam for 100 days to monitor the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with previous human rights recommendations. They believe that Suhakam's performance should be judged by the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not by the number of statements or reports produced. One of Suhakam's commissioners, Prof Hamdan Adnan, called the boycott unfair and expressed disappointment that the NGOs are not working with them to advance human rights in the country.
