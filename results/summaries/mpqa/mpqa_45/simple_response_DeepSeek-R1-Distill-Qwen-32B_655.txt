Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about NGOs boycotting the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They're upset because the government isn't following Suhakam's recommendations and they're concerned about the commission's independence after some appointments.

First, I need to understand the key points. The NGOs are suspending their engagements because the government hasn't acted on Suhakam's reports. They're also worried that the new appointments, like Abu Talib, might compromise Suhakam's independence. The NGOs are highlighting the decline in human rights in Malaysia, like more detentions without trial and restrictions on freedoms.

I should make sure the summary captures the moral stance of the NGOs. They see Suhakam as a PR tool instead of a real human rights body. I'll mention the specific issues they're highlighting, like the Internal Security Act and the new commissioners' backgrounds.

Also, I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the boycott, then the reasons, the concerns about appointments, and the NGOs' stance on human rights. I'll end with their plan to review the situation after 100 days and Suhakam's response.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Make sure to include all the main points without getting too detailed. Double-check to ensure the moral framing is preserved, showing the NGOs' disappointment and the government's lack of action.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and its perceived lack of independence. NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the controversial Kesas report, which accused the police of excessive force. They also highlighted the decline in human rights in Malaysia, citing increased detentions without trial, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws. The NGOs expressed concern over recent appointments to Suhakam, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman, questioning his commitment to human rights and independence. They argue that the removal of three commissioners, instrumental in the Kesas report, undermines Suhakam's credibility. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and decide whether to resume engagements after 100 days. Suhakam, however, criticized the boycott as "unfair," urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
