SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The government's failure to respect Suhakam's recommendations has created the impression that the commission is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs are also concerned about the decline of human rights in Malaysia, including the detention of people without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, and restrictions on free speech and expression. The boycott is a protest against the government's disregard for human rights and its failure to fulfill its promise to protect and promote human rights in Malaysia. END OF SUMMARY.
