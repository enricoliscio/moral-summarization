SUMMARY:
Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have decided to boycott the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24th, 2002. The reason for this decision is their concern about the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. They cite specific issues such as the government's disregard for Suhakam's reports on freedom of assembly and the use of excessive force by police during a mass anti-government gathering. The NGOs also lament the increasing number of people detained without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive amendments to election laws, which have denied democratic space. They further express disappointment in the government's failure to commit to universal human rights principles by ratifying key international covenants. The controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the removal of three commissioners who were instrumental in a critical report, have also raised doubts about the commission's independence. The NGOs worry that the new commissioners, mostly retired civil servants, may not objectively assess executive policies that impinge on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage in any dialogues or send memorandums to Suhakam but will monitor the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with Suhakam's previous recommendations. They emphasize that Suhakam's success should be judged by the improvement of human rights in Malaysia. One Suhakam commissioner has expressed disappointment in the boycott, calling it unfair and suggesting that NGOs are acting out of self-interest rather than honestly championing human rights.
