SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations creates the impression that the commission is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs also lament the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing increasing numbers of people detained without trial and restrictions on free speech and assembly. The boycott is a protest against the government's disdain for human rights and its failure to respect Suhakam's independence. END OF SUMMARY.
