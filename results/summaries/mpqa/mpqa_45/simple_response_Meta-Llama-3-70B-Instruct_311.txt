SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect Suhakam's recommendations, including its maiden report and freedom of assembly report, and the appointment of a new chairperson and commissioners who are perceived to be biased towards the government. The NGOs also expressed concern over the government's failure to ratify international human rights instruments and the increasing use of detention without trial, police bans on assemblies, and restrictions on free speech and expression. The boycott is seen as a moral imperative to hold the government accountable for its human rights record and to ensure that Suhakam remains an independent and effective institution.
