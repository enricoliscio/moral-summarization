SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect and recognize Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found police guilty of excessive force during a mass gathering. The government has also failed to ratify international human rights instruments. The NGOs are concerned about the appointment of a new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners, which undermines Suhakam's independence. They also question the commitment of the new commissioners to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights. The boycott is seen as a moral imperative to hold the government accountable for its human rights record and to ensure that Suhakam remains an independent and effective institution.
