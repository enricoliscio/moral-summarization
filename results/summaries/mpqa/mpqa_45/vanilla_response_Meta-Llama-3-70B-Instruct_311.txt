SUMMARY:

Thirty-two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Malaysia have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs claim that the government has ignored Suhakam's reports and failed to respect its recommendations, leading to a decline in human rights in Malaysia. They also express concern over the appointment of a new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, which they believe undermines the commission's independence. The NGOs will not hold dialogues or send memorandums to Suhakam during the boycott period and will instead monitor the commission's performance. They will review their position after 100 days.

END OF SUMMARY.
