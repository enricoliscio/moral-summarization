SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect or recognise Suhakam's recommendations, which has created the impression that the commission is a mere public relations tool. The government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The NGOs are also concerned about the decline of human rights in Malaysia, including the detention of people without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, and restrictions on free speech and expression. The appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's chairperson has also raised concerns about the commission's independence. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their position after the 100-day period.
