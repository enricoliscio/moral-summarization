SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have taken a stand against what they perceive as a decline in human rights and the government's disregard for the recommendations of the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, or Suhakam. They have boycotted Suhakam for 100 days to protest the government's inaction on Suhakam's reports and recommendations, particularly on the freedom of assembly and the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during an anti-government gathering. The NGOs also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing detentions without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive amendments to election laws. They questioned the independence of Suhakam following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners who were instrumental in the Kesas report. The NGOs expressed concern over the appointment of retired civil servants as commissioners and doubted their ability to objectively assess and critique executive policies impinging on human rights. They vowed to monitor Suhakam's performance and judge it based on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment in the boycott, believing that NGOs should work with Suhakam for human rights advancement.
