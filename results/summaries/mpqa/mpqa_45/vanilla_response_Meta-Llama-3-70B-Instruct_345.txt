SUMMARY:

Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, effective April 24. The boycott is in protest of the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs claim that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports and has failed to respect or recognize its recommendations. They also expressed concern over the appointment of new commissioners, including a former attorney-general, which they believe undermines Suhakam's independence. The NGOs will not hold dialogues or send memorandums to Suhakam during the boycott period and will instead monitor the commission's performance. They will review their position after 100 days. A Suhakam commissioner has described the boycott as "unfair‚Äù and urged the NGOs to work with the commission for the advancement of human rights.
