SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organisations have suspended their engagement with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24, 2002, due to concerns over the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs, led by human rights organisation Hakam, cited the government's dismissal of Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report, as well as the failure to respect or recognise the commission's recommendations. They also lamented the increasing use of the Internal Security Act to detain people without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive amendments to election laws, which have denied democratic space. The controversial appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments, including those instrumental in the critical Kesas report, have also raised doubts about the commission's independence. The NGOs expressed concern that Suhakam is now mostly comprised of retired civil servants, questioning their ability to objectively assess and critique executive policies that impinge on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will refrain from dialogues or sending memorandums to Suhakam, instead monitoring the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations on human rights issues. They emphasised that Suhakam's success will be judged on the actual improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not just on reports produced. One of the Suhakam commissioners, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, arguing that the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights and that the boycott may create the impression that the NGOs are acting out of self-interest.
