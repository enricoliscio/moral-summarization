SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs also lament the decline of human rights in Malaysia, including the increasing numbers of people detained without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, and restrictions on free speech and expression. The appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's new chairperson has also raised concerns about the commission's independence. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their position after the 100-day period.
