SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's failure to act on its recommendations. The NGOs argue that the government has ignored Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report, and dismissed the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass gathering. The NGOs also lament the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing numbers of people detained without trial and restrictions on free speech and assembly. They criticize the government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations, giving the impression that Suhakam is merely a public relations tool. The NGOs further express concern over the controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson, and the removal of three commissioners who were instrumental in the critical Kesas report. They question Abu Talib's commitment to protecting civil liberties and highlight his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' detentions and the impeachment of the Lord President and Supreme Court judges in 1988. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance during the boycott and review their position after the 100-day period. They emphasize that Suhakam's success should be judged on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not on the number of reports produced. END OF SUMMARY.
