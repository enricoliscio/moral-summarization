SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force. The government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs also lament the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing increasing detentions without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, and restrictions to free speech and expression. The controversial appointments to Suhakam have also raised concerns about its independence and commitment to protecting civil liberties. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their position after 100 days. END OF SUMMARY.
