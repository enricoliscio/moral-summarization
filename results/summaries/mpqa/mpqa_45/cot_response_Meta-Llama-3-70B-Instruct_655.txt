SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force. The government's failure to respect Suhakam's recommendations has created the impression that the commission is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs are also concerned about the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing numbers of people detained without trial and restrictions on free speech and assembly. The controversial appointments to Suhakam have undermined its independence, and the NGOs will review their position after the 100-day period. END OF SUMMARY.
