SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended their engagement with Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days in protest of the government's poor response to the Commission's recommendations. The boycott highlights the government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's advice, creating the impression that the Commission is merely a "public relations tool". The NGOs lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing the increasing use of the ISA, police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive amendments to election laws as evidence. They also expressed concern over the controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson, and the non-renewal of three commissioners who were instrumental in a critical report on police use of excessive force. The NGOs questioned Abu Talib's commitment to civil liberties and highlighted his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' and his role in the impeachment of judicial officers. They also questioned the appointment of retired civil servants as commissioners and whether they could objectively assess executive policies impacting human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations. Ramdas Tikamdas, speaking on behalf of the NGOs, emphasized that Suhakam's success would be judged by the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not by the number of statements or reports produced. The NGOs will review their position after the 100-day boycott period. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment in the boycott, calling it unfair and questioning the NGOs' commitment to championing human rights.
