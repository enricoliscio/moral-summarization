Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government hasn't responded well to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights, like people being detained without trial, restrictions on assembly, and free speech. They also mention the government hasn't ratified key international human rights instruments.

There's also a concern about the independence of Suhakam after some commissioners were replaced. The NGOs feel that the new appointments might not be committed to human rights, especially since one of them was involved in past controversial actions. They're boycotting by not engaging with Suhakam and monitoring its performance.

I need to include the morally framed words the author used, such as "ignored," "failed," "detained," "restrictions," etc. I should make sure the summary reflects the NGOs' criticism of the government's actions and their concerns about Suhakam's effectiveness.

Let me structure the summary: start with the NGOs' action, their reasons (government's failure to respond), mention the human rights issues, the concern over commissioners' appointments, and the NGOs' boycott and monitoring plan. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's failure to address Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found excessive police force during a 2000 anti-government gathering. They highlighted a decline in human rights, with increasing detentions without trial, bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws. The NGOs also noted the government's lack of commitment to international human rights instruments. Concerns over Suhakam's independence arose after controversial appointments, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson, and the removal of three commissioners seen as critical of the government. The NGOs boycotted Suhakam, refusing dialogues or complaints, while monitoring its performance. They emphasized that Suhakam's value lies in improving human rights, not just issuing reports. The NGOs will review their stance after 100 days. END OF SUMMARY.
