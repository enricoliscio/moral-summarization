SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The NGOs, led by human rights organization Hakam, cited the government's disregard for Suhakam's reports and the decline of human rights in the country as reasons for the boycott. They also expressed concern over the controversial appointments to the commission, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners who were instrumental in a critical report on police use of excessive force. The NGOs questioned Abu Talib's commitment to protecting civil liberties and raised concerns about the independence of the commission. They also noted that the government has yet to ratify key international human rights instruments. Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan expressed disappointment with the boycott, saying that the NGOs should work with the commission to advance human rights. The NGOs plan to review their position after the 100-day boycott period. Notable NGOs involved include the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), Suaram, and Amnesty International's Malaysian chapter.
