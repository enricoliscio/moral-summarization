SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's failure to act on its recommendations. The NGOs, led by Hakam president Ramdas Tikamdas, expressed deep concern over the government's disregard for Suhakam's reports, particularly its maiden report and its freedom of assembly report. The government has also failed to respect Suhakam's recommendations and has been criticized for the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing numbers of people detained without trial and restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly. The controversial appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments have raised doubts about the commission's independence. The NGOs questioned Abu Talib's commitment to protecting civil liberties and highlighted his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' and his role in the impeachment of the Lord President and Supreme Court judges in 1988. They also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners, mostly retired civil servants, and whether they can objectively assess executive policies that impinge on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage in any dialogues or send memorandums to Suhakam but will monitor the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations. Ramdas stressed that Suhakam's success will be judged on the actual improvement of human rights in Malaysia. END OF SUMMARY.
