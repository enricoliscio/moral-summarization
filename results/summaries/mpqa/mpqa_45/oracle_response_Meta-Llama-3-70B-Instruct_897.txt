SUMMARY:

Thirty-two NGOs in Malaysia have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but "a mere public relations tool". The NGOs also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing the increasing numbers of people detained without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, and restrictions on free speech and expression. The NGOs are also concerned about the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's new chairperson, which they perceive as undermining the commission's independence. The boycott is a protest against the government's failure to respect and recognize Suhakam's recommendations, and the NGOs will review their position after the 100-day period.
