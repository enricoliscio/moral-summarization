SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have decided to boycott the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, or Suhakam, for 100 days to protest the government's inadequate response to the commission's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports and recommendations, particularly on issues of freedom of assembly and police use of excessive force. They also expressed concern over the controversial appointments to Suhakam's leadership, including the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson, and the non-renewal of three commissioners who were instrumental in a critical report on police conduct. The NGOs questioned Abu Talib's commitment to civil liberties and human rights, citing his defense of mass detentions under the Internal Security Act in 1987 and his role in the impeachment of judicial officials in 1988. They also questioned the independence of Suhakam with the majority of its commissioners being retired civil servants. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage in any dialogues or send complaints to Suhakam but will monitor the commission's performance and the government's compliance with Suhakam's recommendations. They expect to see improvements in the human rights situation in Malaysia as a result. Ramdas Tikamdas, president of human rights organization Hakam, stressed that the boycott is not personal but a stand against the erosion of human rights and the weakening of Suhakam's independence.
