Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, keeping as many of those words as possible, and make sure it's under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 32 NGOs boycotting Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government hasn't responded well to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights in Malaysia, mentioning things like detentions without trial, bans on assemblies, restrictions on speech, and amendments to election laws. They also criticize the government for not ratifying international human rights covenants.

Next, the article talks about controversial appointments within Suhakam. The new chairperson, Abu Talib Othman, is a former attorney-general, and the NGOs are worried about his commitment to human rights, especially given his past actions like defending the Internal Security Act and impeaching judges. The NGOs are also concerned about the new commissioners being mostly retired civil servants, questioning their ability to objectively assess government policies.

The NGOs are suspending all engagements with Suhakam and will monitor its performance. They plan to meet after 100 days to review their position. On the other side, a Suhakam commissioner feels the boycott is unfair and suggests the NGOs should work with them instead.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words: ignored, dismissed, force, failed, decline, failure, detained, trial, ban, restrictions, amendments, denied, dropped, axed, pleased, undermines, policies, impinge, compliance, improvement, advancement, acknowledge.

I'll start by stating the NGOs' boycott and their reasons, using the moral words where appropriate. I'll mention the government's failure to respond and the decline in human rights. Then, I'll address the concerns about the new appointments and the impact on Suhakam's independence. Finally, I'll note the NGOs' monitoring and the commissioner's response.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make each sentence cover a main point without going into too much detail. I'll ensure that the moral framing is clear by using the specified words. Let me structure this step by step to make sure I hit all the key points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's failure to address its recommendations. They criticize the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found police used excessive force during a 2000 anti-government rally. The NGOs highlight the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing detentions without trial, bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws. They also note the government's failure to ratify key international human rights instruments. Concerns over Suhakam's independence arise from controversial appointments, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson and the axing of three commissioners. The NGOs question whether retired civil servants can objectively critique government policies. They will monitor Suhakam's performance and compliance with previous recommendations, judging its success by human rights improvements, not just reports. The NGOs stress their commitment to advancing human rights and will review their position after 100 days. Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan calls the boycott "unfair," urging NGOs to work with the commission instead. END OF SUMMARY.
