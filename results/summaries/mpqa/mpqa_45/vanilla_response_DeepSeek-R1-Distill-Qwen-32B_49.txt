Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They're protesting the government's lack of response to Suhakam's recommendations. 

The NGOs are concerned that the government hasn't acted on Suhakam's reports, especially the Kesas report which criticized the police's use of excessive force. They also mention that the government hasn't ratified key international human rights covenants, which is a problem.

Another issue is the recent appointments to Suhakam. The NGOs are worried about the independence of the commission because three commissioners were removed, and the new chairperson, Abu Talib Othman, has a history that doesn't align with human rights advocacy. They're concerned this makes Suhakam seem like a tool for the government rather than an independent body.

The NGOs are boycotting by not engaging in dialogues or sending complaints to Suhakam. They'll monitor the commission's actions during this period. Suhakam's performance will be judged based on actual human rights improvements, not just reports.

On the other side, a Suhakam commissioner feels the boycott is unfair and suggests NGOs should work with Suhakam instead. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the NGOs' boycott and their reasons: government's neglect of Suhakam's recommendations, human rights decline, and concerns over the commission's independence due to appointments. Mention the key points like the Kesas report, lack of international covenants ratified, and the new chairperson's background. Also, include the NGOs' actions and Suhakam's response.

Let me structure it: 

- NGOs suspend engagements with Suhakam for 100 days.
- Reasons: government neglect, human rights decline, appointments undermining independence.
- Concerns about the chairperson and retired civil servants on the commission.
- NGOs will monitor Suhakam's actions and performance.
- Suhakam's response: disappointment, suggesting collaboration instead.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's neglect of Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights. They criticize the government for ignoring reports, including the Kesas report, which criticized police force, and for not ratifying international human rights covenants. Concerns over Suhakam's independence arise from the removal of three commissioners and the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman, linked to past human rights issues. NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance, judging it by actual rights improvements, not just reports. Suhakam's commissioner expressed disappointment, urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
