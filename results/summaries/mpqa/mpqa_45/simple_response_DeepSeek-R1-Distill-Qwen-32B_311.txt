Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. They're protesting the government's lack of response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government isn't respecting human rights and that Suhakam isn't independent.

I should highlight the key points: the boycott, the reasons behind it (ignored reports, government's actions like detentions and restrictions), concerns about Suhakam's independence due to new appointments, and the NGOs' stance that Suhakam isn't effective.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral issues, like the decline in human rights and the NGOs' criticism of the government's actions. Also, mention the counterpoint from Suhakam's commissioner who thinks the boycott is unfair.

Let me structure it: start with the NGOs' action, their reasons, concerns about Suhakam's independence, and the counterargument. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's neglect of Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs criticized the government's failure to address issues like detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly and speech, and amendments to election laws, which they argue erode democratic space. They also expressed concerns over Suhakam's independence following controversial appointments, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson and the removal of three commissioners linked to critical reports. The NGOs argue that these changes undermine Suhakam's credibility and its ability to objectively assess government policies. They will monitor Suhakam's performance and evaluate its impact on human rights. Suhakam commissioner Prof. Hamdan Adnan criticized the boycott, calling it "unfair" and urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
