SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The boycott began on April 24, coinciding with the appointment of a new chairperson and five new commissioners to Suhakam. The NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports and recommendations, including the Kesas report which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass gathering in 2000. They also expressed concern over the independence of Suhakam following the controversial appointments, noting that the new chairperson, Abu Talib Othman, has a history of defending the Internal Security Act (ISA) and the impeachment of judicial officials. The NGOs questioned the ability of retired civil servants, who make up the majority of the new commissioners, to objectively assess and critique executive policies that impinge on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage with Suhakam but will monitor the commission's performance and the government's compliance with Suhakam's previous recommendations. They will review their position after the 100-day period. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment over the boycott, stating that it was unfair and could create the impression that the NGOs are acting out of self-interest. END OF SUMMARY.
