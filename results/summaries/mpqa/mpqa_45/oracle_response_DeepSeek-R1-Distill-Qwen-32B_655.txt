Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. The NGOs are protesting the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the recent appointments that they see as undermining the commission's independence.

The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I need to include as many of those as possible in the summary. Words like "ignored," "dismissed," "failed," "decline," "detained," "ban," "restrictions," "denied," "undermines," etc., are key here.

I should structure the summary to highlight the NGOs' concerns: the government ignoring Suhakam's reports, the Prime Minister dismissing a report, the decline in human rights, and the controversial appointments that threaten the commission's independence. Also, mention the NGOs' boycott actions and their expectations for Suhakam to improve human rights.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start with the NGOs' action, then the reasons, the impact on human rights, the concerns about the new appointments, and end with the NGOs' expectations and the response from Suhakam.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all the moral terms are included where appropriate. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct. Also, I need to remember to place the summary between the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's failure to address Suhakam's recommendations and the recent appointments that undermine its independence. The NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which was dismissed by the Prime Minister as "western biased." They highlighted the decline in human rights in Malaysia, citing detentions without trial, bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and restrictive election laws. The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as Suhakam's chairperson and the removal of three commissioners, Anuar Zainal Abidin, Prof Mehrun Siraj, and Dr Salleh Mohd Nor, who were seen as performing their duties without fear or favor. The NGOs questioned whether retired civil servants could objectively critique government policies. They vowed to monitor Suhakam's performance and evaluate its impact on human rights improvements. The NGOs emphasized that Suhakam's value lies in advancing human rights, not just producing reports. Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan criticized the boycott as "unfair," arguing that collaboration, not isolation, was the better path for human rights advancement. END OF SUMMARY.
