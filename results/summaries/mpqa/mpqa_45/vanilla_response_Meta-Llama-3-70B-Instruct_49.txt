SUMMARY:

Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have suspended their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, citing the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are protesting the government's failure to respect or recognize Suhakam's recommendations, particularly in regards to the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering. The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of a new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, which they believe undermines Suhakam's independence. During the boycott, the NGOs will not hold dialogues or send memorandums to Suhakam, but will instead monitor the commission's performance and judge it on its ability to improve human rights in Malaysia.

END OF SUMMARY.
