SUMMARY:
Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, or Suhakam, for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to the commission's recommendations. The boycott, which began on April 24, 2002, was sparked by the government's disregard for Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report. The NGOs expressed deep concern that the government had ignored Suhakam's findings and recommendations, lamenting the decline of human rights in the country. They also criticized the government for failing to respect universal human rights principles by not ratifying key international human rights instruments. The controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the replacement of three commissioners and the selection of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson, have raised doubts about the commission's independence. The NGOs perceived that the commissioners who were dropped had been performing their duties without fear or favor, and that the new chairperson had a history of defending actions that infringed on civil liberties. They questioned whether retired civil servants appointed as commissioners could objectively assess and critique executive policies impinging on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage with Suhakam but will monitor the commissioners' performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations on human rights issues. They emphasized that Suhakam's success should be judged by the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not by the number of statements or reports produced. One Suhakam commissioner expressed disappointment with the boycott, calling it unfair and suggesting that the NGOs were acting out of self-interest and dishonesty. END OF SUMMARY.
