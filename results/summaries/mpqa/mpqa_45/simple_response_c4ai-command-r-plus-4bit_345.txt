SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have taken a stand for human rights and against governmental indifference by boycotting the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, or Suhakam, for 100 days. This bold move is a protest against the government's repeated failure to act on Suhakam's recommendations and its disregard for human rights, as evidenced by the increasing use of the Internal Security Act to detain people without trial and the erosion of freedoms of assembly, speech, and expression. The final straw for the NGOs was the government's controversial appointment of the new chairperson and commissioners, which raised doubts about Suhakam's independence and commitment to human rights. They questioned the new chairperson's defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' and his role in the impeachment of the Lord President and Supreme Court judges in 1988. The NGOs lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia and vowed to monitor Suhakam's performance, not based on reports or statements, but on the tangible improvement of human rights in the country. They urged Suhakam to fulfill the promise of being a positive force for human rights protection and promotion. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment in the boycott, believing that the NGOs should work together with Suhakam for human rights advancement.
END OF SUMMARY.
