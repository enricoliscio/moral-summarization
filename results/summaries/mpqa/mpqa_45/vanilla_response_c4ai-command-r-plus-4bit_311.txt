SUMMARY: Thirty-two Malaysian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24, 2002, to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report which found the police guilty of using excessive force during an anti-government gathering in 2000. They also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly and free speech, and amendments to election laws. The NGOs raised concerns about Suhakam's independence following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments. They questioned Abu Talib's commitment to civil liberties and human rights, citing his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' and his role in the impeachment of the Lord President and Supreme Court judges in 1988. The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners, mostly retired civil servants, and doubted their ability to objectively assess executive policies impacting human rights. Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan called the boycott unfair and said it created the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self-interest. END OF SUMMARY.
