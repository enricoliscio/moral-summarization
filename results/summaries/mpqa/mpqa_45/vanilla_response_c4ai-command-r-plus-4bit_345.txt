SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24, 2002, due to concerns about the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The boycott is also in protest of controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the new chairperson, former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman, and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments. The NGOs argue that Suhakam's independence has been undermined and that the new commissioners, mostly retired civil servants, may not be objective in assessing executive policies that impinge on human rights. During the boycott, the NGOs will not engage in any dialogues or send any memorandums or complaints to Suhakam. Instead, they will monitor Suhakam's performance and the government's compliance with previous recommendations on human rights issues. One of Suhakam's commissioners, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, stating that the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
