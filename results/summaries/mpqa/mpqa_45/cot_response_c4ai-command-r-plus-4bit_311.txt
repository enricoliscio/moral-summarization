SUMMARY:
Thirty-two NGOs have suspended all engagement with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The boycott, which began on April 24, highlights the NGOs' deep concern over the government's disregard for Suhakam's reports, particularly the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of excessive force during an anti-government gathering. The NGOs lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, citing increasing detentions without trial, blanket police bans on assemblies, restrictions on free speech, and amendments to election laws that deny democratic space. They also noted the government's failure to ratify key international human rights instruments. The controversial appointments to Suhakam, including the replacement of three commissioners and the selection of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson, have raised concerns about Suhakam's independence. The NGOs perceived that commissioners instrumental in critical reports were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favor, undermining Suhakam's independence and eroding public confidence. Meanwhile, one Suhakam commissioner expressed disappointment with the boycott, calling it unfair and suggesting that the NGOs are acting out of self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to human rights. The NGOs, however, maintain that their concern is based on Abu Talib's defense of past human rights violations and his role in the impeachment of judicial officials. They will monitor Suhakam's performance and review their position after the 100-day period.
