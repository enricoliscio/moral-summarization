Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally charged words as possible and be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, for 100 days. They're protesting the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights, the government ignoring reports, and the appointment of commissioners that might undermine Suhakam's independence.

I notice that the author used words like "ignored," "failed," "decline," "detained," "restrictions," "amendments," "denied," "dropped," "axed," "pleased," "undermines," "impinge," "compliance," "improvement," "advancement," and "acknowledge." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the key points: the NGOs' boycott, the reasons (government ignoring reports, human rights decline, controversial appointments), and the implications. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the action (boycott), then the reasons, followed by the impact and the response from Suhakam.

I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, when talking about the government's response, I'll use "ignored" and "failed." When discussing the commissioners, I'll use "dropped" and "axed." I'll also highlight the NGOs' concerns about the commissioners' independence and the impact on human rights.

I need to keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed. I'll end by mentioning the NGOs' intention to review their position after 100 days and the opposing viewpoint from Suhakam's commissioner.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the necessary morally framed words. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's failure to address its recommendations. They criticized the government for ignoring Suhakam's reports, including the Kesas report, which found excessive police force during a 2000 anti-government rally. NGOs highlighted the decline in human rights, citing detentions without trial, assembly bans, free speech restrictions, and restrictive election laws. They also noted the government's lack of commitment to international human rights instruments. Controversial appointments to Suhakam, including former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chair, raised concerns about the commission's independence. NGOs expressed doubt about the new commissioners' ability to objectively assess government policies. They will monitor Suhakam's performance, judging it by human rights improvements rather than reports produced. The NGOs stressed Suhakam's potential to fulfill its mandate but questioned its credibility under current leadership. Suhakam commissioner Prof. Hamdan Adnan criticized the boycott as "unfair," urging collaboration instead. The NGOs will review their position after 100 days. END OF SUMMARY.
