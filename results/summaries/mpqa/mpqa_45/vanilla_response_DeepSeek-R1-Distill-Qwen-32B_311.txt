Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, Suhakam, for 100 days. They're protesting because the government hasn't acted on Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned about the decline in human rights in Malaysia, like people being detained without trial and restrictions on free speech.

They also mention the recent appointments to Suhakam, questioning its independence. The new chairperson, Abu Talib, was a former attorney-general involved in controversial cases. The NGOs worry that Suhakam is becoming a tool for the government rather than an independent body. They plan to monitor Suhakam's performance and will review their position after 100 days.

On the other hand, Suhakam's commissioner, Hamdan Adnan, feels the boycott is unfair and suggests the NGOs should work with them instead.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the NGOs' boycott, reasons (government's lack of action, human rights decline, concerns over Suhakam's independence), and the response from Suhakam.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's neglect of Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights. They criticize the government for ignoring reports, including the Kesas report, which criticized police excesses. The NGOs also express concern over Suhakam's independence due to controversial appointments, such as former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chairperson, and the removal of three commissioners. They question whether retired civil servants can objectively assess government policies. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and may reassess their position after 100 days. Suhakam commissioner Hamdan Adnan calls the boycott "unfair" and urges collaboration. END OF SUMMARY.
