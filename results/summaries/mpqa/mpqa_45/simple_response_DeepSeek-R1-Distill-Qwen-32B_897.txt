Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about 32 NGOs suspending their engagements with Suhakam for 100 days. They're protesting the government's lack of response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs are concerned that the government isn't respecting human rights and that Suhakam is just a PR tool.

They mention specific issues like detentions without trial, restrictions on assembly and speech, and election laws. Also, the government hasn't ratified key international human rights covenants.

The appointment of Abu Talib as chair is a problem because of his past actions, like defending Ops Lalang and impeaching judges. The NGOs worry this affects Suhakam's independence.

They're boycotting by not engaging in dialogues or sending complaints. They'll monitor Suhakam's performance and decide after 100 days. Suhakam's commissioner, Hamdan, feels the boycott is unfair and that NGOs should work with them instead.

I need to capture all these points concisely, keeping the moral tone about the government's failure to uphold human rights and the NGOs' justified protest. I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words and structured clearly.

SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have suspended engagements with Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, protesting the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and the decline in human rights. They criticize the government's failure to address excessive police force, detentions without trial, and restrictions on free speech and assembly. The NGOs also highlight the government's lack of commitment to international human rights instruments. Concerns over Suhakam's independence arise from the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as chair, linked to past controversial actions, and the removal of commissioners who authored critical reports. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and reassess their stance after the boycott period. Suhakam's commissioner, however, views the boycott as unfair, urging collaboration instead. END OF SUMMARY.
