SUMMARY: Thirty-two NGOs have temporarily boycotted Malaysia's Human Rights Commission (Suhakam), citing concerns about the government's disregard for Suhakam's recommendations and the decline of human rights in the country. The boycott, which will last for 100 days, is a protest against the government's failure to act on Suhakam's reports, particularly the Kesas report which found the police guilty of using excessive force during an anti-government gathering. The NGOs also criticized the government for not adhering to universal human rights principles and questioned the independence of Suhakam following controversial appointments to the commission. They argued that the removal of three commissioners who were instrumental in the Kesas report and the appointment of a new chairperson with a questionable human rights record undermined Suhakam's integrity and public confidence. The NGOs will monitor Suhakam's performance and judge it based on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not on the number of reports produced. They will reassess their position after the 100-day period. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, believing that the NGOs should work collaboratively with Suhakam to advance human rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
