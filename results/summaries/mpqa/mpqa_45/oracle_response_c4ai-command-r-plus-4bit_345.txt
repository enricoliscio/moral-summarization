SUMMARY: Thirty-two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have boycotted the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) for 100 days, starting from April 24, 2002, to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's recommendations. The NGOs, including Hakam, MTUC, Suaram, and Amnesty International's Malaysian chapter, cited the government's failure to adhere to Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report, as well as the dismissal of the Kesas report, which found the police guilty of using excessive force. They also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia, with increasing numbers of people detained without trial, restrictions on free speech and assembly, and amendments to election laws that deny democratic space. The NGOs questioned the independence of Suhakam following the appointment of Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the non-renewal of three commissioners' appointments. They claimed that those who performed their duties without fear or favour were dropped, undermining the Commission's independence. The NGOs expressed concern over the appointment of retired civil servants as commissioners and whether they can objectively assess and critique executive policies that impinge on human rights. They will monitor Suhakam's performance and judge it based on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia, not on the number of statements or reports produced. One Suhakam commissioner, Prof Hamdan Adnan, expressed disappointment with the boycott, stating that the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights and that the boycott may create the impression that they are acting out of self-interest.
