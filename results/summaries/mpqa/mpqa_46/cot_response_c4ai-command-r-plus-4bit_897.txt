SUMMARY:
Seyyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP) and a former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), strongly **rejected** the US State Department's report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights **violations**. Abbas highlighted the irony of America, itself a **violator** of human rights, pointing out its involvement in the killing and **injury** of thousands of innocent people, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror." He also condemned the US for its **maltreatment** of prisoners of war. Abbas **criticized** America's double standards, **denouncing** human rights **violations** while simultaneously **supporting** Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He accused the US of **labelling** countries that refuse to bow to its **dictation** as human rights **violators**, while **showering** favors on those that **submit** to its **policies**. Abbas **hopes** that the world can see through America's unjust and **discriminatory** actions and no longer **believes** its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
