Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report on Iran and other countries. He's criticizing the US for being hypocritical because they violate human rights themselves.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "rejected," "violator," "killed," "innocent," "maltreated," "double standard," "denounces," "perishing," "injustices," "discriminatory," and "hypocrisy" stand out. These words are charged with moral judgment, so I should list them in step one.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words. I need to capture the main points: Abbas rejecting the report, criticizing US hypocrisy, mentioning their actions in the Muslim world, their support for Israel, and the double standard policy. Also, he hopes the world sees through their policies.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his rejection, then the reasons behind it, and ending with his hope about global awareness. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so using words like "hypocrisy," "violator," and "discriminatory" will be important.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll draft the summary, then trim any unnecessary words to keep it concise. Also, I need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I've covered all the key points. Now, I'll put it all together, making sure the moral elements are clear and the summary is within the word limit.

He criticized the US for violating human rights while accusing others, citing its role in killing innocent people in the Muslim world and maltreating prisoners of war. Abbas condemned America's double standard policy, where it denounces human rights violations but supports Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He argued that independent nations not submissive to US dictates are labeled as human rights violators, while those compliant receive favors. Abbas accused the US of pursuing strategic and economic interests under the guise of combating terrorism. He expressed hope that the world can recognize the injustices and discriminatory policies of America, as people no longer believe its claims.
