SUMMARY:

Seyed Qamar Abbas, Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP), has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries. Abbas argues that the US has no right to make such a report as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world. He criticizes the US for having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that are independent and do not submit to US policies are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are showered with favors. He concludes that the people of the world can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe what the US says.
