SUMMARY: A senior leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed and injured thousands of innocent people in the Muslim world under the guise of its "war on terror." He condemns the US for its double standards, supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon while denouncing human rights violations in other countries. Abbas believes that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights violators, while rewarding those that accept its supremacy. He accuses the US of pursuing its own strategic and economic interests under the pretext of fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Abbas concludes that the people of the world are no longer in the dark and can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies. END OF SUMMARY.
