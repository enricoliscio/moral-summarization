SUMMARY:

Pakistani leader Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, accusing America of being a violator of human rights itself. Abbas argued that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its so-called war on terror. He criticized the US for having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violation while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas claimed that independent nations that refuse to submit to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply are showered with favors. He accused the US of following its strategic and economic interests, rather than genuinely fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Abbas expressed hope that people can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and no longer believe its claims.
