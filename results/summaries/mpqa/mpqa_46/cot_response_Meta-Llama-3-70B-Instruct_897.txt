SUMMARY:
Former Pakistani provincial minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own "violations" of human rights globally. Abbas argued that the US has "killed thousands of innocent people" in the Muslim world, particularly in Afghanistan, and has a "double standard policy" when it comes to human rights. He criticized the US for supporting Israel's "perishing" of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon, while labelling independent nations that don't submit to US policies as human rights "violators". Abbas concluded that the US follows its own "strategic and economic interests" and that people are no longer blind to its "unjust and discriminatory policies". He hopes that the world can see through America's motives and no longer believes its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
