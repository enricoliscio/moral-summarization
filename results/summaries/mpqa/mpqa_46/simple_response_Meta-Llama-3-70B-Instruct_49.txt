SUMMARY:

Former Pakistani minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has condemned the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, arguing that the US has no moral authority to criticize others given its own history of human rights violations. Abbas pointed out that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He criticized the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that refuse to submit to US dominance are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. He accused the US of pursuing its strategic and economic interests under the pretext of fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Abbas expressed hope that people around the world are no longer fooled by US rhetoric and can see through its unjust and discriminatory policies.
