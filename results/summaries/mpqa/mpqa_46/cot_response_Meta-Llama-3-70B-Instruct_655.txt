SUMMARY:
Former Pakistani minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own record of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "so-called war on terror". He criticizes the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries which refuse to submit to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply are showered with favours. He hopes that people can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
