SUMMARY:
Seyyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), has vehemently **rejected** the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas **criticized** the US for its hypocrisy, stating that it has no right to accuse others of human rights violations when it has **killed** and **injured** thousands of innocent people worldwide, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror." He highlighted the US's **discriminatory** policies and its unconditional support for Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas asserted that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as **human rights violators**, while those that comply are rewarded. He believes that the US is only motivated by its strategic and economic interests, but the **people of the world are no longer in the dark**. They can see through the US's unjust actions and **do not believe** its claims. Abbas's statement highlights the moral concerns surrounding the US's self-proclaimed role as a global arbiter of human rights.
