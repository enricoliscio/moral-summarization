SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own human rights violations. Abbas argued that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He accused the US of having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that don't submit to US policies are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. He thinks the US follows its own interests, using its "war on terrorism" and "war against weapons of mass destruction" as a cover for its strategic and economic interests. Abbas hopes that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe its claims.
