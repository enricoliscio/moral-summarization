SUMMARY:

Seyed Qamar Abbas, Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP), has strongly rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries. He argues that America has no moral authority to criticize others, given its own track record of human rights violations globally, particularly in the Muslim world. Abbas cites the killing of thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan, maltreatment of prisoners of war, and support for Israel's oppression of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon as examples of America's double standard policy. He believes that countries that refuse to submit to US supremacy are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. Abbas concludes that people around the world are no longer deceived by America's rhetoric and can see through its unjust and discriminatory policies, driven by strategic and economic interests.
