SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has condemned the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, arguing that the US has no moral authority to criticize others when it has committed numerous human rights violations itself. Abbas pointed out that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He accused the US of having a double standard policy, where it denounces human rights violations but supports Israel's oppression of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that independent nations that refuse to submit to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those that comply are showered with favors. He hopes that people around the world can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe its claims.
