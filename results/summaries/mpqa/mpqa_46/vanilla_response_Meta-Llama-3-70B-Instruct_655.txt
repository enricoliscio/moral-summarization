SUMMARY:

Seyed Qamar Abbas, Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP) and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries. He argues that the US has no right to make such a report, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world. Abbas criticizes the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He believes that countries that are independent and don't submit to US policies are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are showered with favors. Abbas hopes that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe its claims.
