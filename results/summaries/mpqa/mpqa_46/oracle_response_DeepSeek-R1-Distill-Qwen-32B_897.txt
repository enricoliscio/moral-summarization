Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report on Iran and others. He accuses the US of being a human rights violator themselves, citing their actions in the Muslim world and the Middle East. He also criticizes the double standards, supporting Israel's actions against Muslims. 

The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included: violator, killed, guise, injured, maltreated, violators, has, denounces, violation, supports, perishing, labelled, dark, unjust, discriminatory. I need to make sure these words are in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main points: Abbas rejecting the report, US hypocrisy, their actions in wars, double standards with Israel, labeling independent countries as violators, and the hope that people see through their policies.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points and the moral words. Make sure it's concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.

I think I've got all the necessary elements. Let me check the word count and make sure it's clear and flows well.

SUMMARY: Seyed Qamar Abbas, a leader of Pakistan's PPP, has rejected the US State Department's human rights report on Iran and other countries, accusing America of being a violator of human rights itself. He criticized the US for killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of the "war on terror," and for maltreating prisoners of war. Abbas condemned the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He argued that independent nations not submitting to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply receive favors. Abbas accused the US of pursuing its strategic and economic interests under the guise of combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He expressed hope that the world can no longer be kept in the dark about America's unjust and discriminatory policies, emphasizing that people no longer believe what the US says. END OF SUMMARY.
