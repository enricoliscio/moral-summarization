SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, strongly criticizes the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people worldwide, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror." He exposes America's double standards, condemning human rights abuses while supporting Israel's atrocities against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that the US labels countries as human rights violators based on their submission to its policies and interests, rather than actual human rights practices. He concludes that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer trust its words. Abbas's stance highlights the moral imperative of holding powerful nations accountable for their actions and respecting the independence and human rights of all nations.
