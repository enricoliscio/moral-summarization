SUMMARY:
Former Pakistani minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own "violations" of human rights globally, particularly in the Muslim world. Abbas argued that the US has "killed thousands of innocent people" and "maltreated" prisoners of war, while hypocritically denouncing human rights violations in other countries. He accused the US of having a "double standard policy", supporting Israel's "perishing" of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon, while labeling independent nations as human rights violators. Abbas believes the US follows its own "strategic and economic interests" under the guise of fighting terrorism, and that its "unjust and discriminatory policies" are now visible to the world.
