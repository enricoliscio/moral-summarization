Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, a Pakistani political leader, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's criticizing the US for its own human rights violations, especially in places like Afghanistan and Palestine. He also mentions the double standards of the US supporting Israel while accusing others. The summary needs to capture his main points succinctly, under 200 words. I'll focus on his rejection of the report, his arguments about US hypocrisy, and his hope that the world sees through their policies. I should structure it clearly, starting with his rejection, then his criticisms, and ending with his hope. Make sure to include key terms like "double standard," "war on terror," and "strategic interests." Keep it concise and within the word limit.
