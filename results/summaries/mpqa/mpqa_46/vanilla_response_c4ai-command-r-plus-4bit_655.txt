SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, rejected the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas criticized the US for its double standards and selective condemnation of human rights abuses, arguing that the US itself is a violator of human rights, citing the killing and injury of thousands of innocent people in Muslim countries under the guise of the war on terror. He accused the US of supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon while denouncing human rights violations in other countries. Abbas also suggested that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights violators and that its actions are driven by its strategic and economic interests. He expressed hope that people worldwide can see through the US's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe whatever it says. END OF SUMMARY.
