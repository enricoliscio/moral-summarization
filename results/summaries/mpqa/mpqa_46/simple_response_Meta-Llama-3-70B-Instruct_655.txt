SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has strongly condemned the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, arguing that the US has no moral authority to criticize others when it has committed numerous human rights violations itself. Abbas pointed out that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He also criticized the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that refuse to submit to US dictates are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. He urged people to see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies, which are driven by strategic and economic interests rather than a genuine concern for human rights.
