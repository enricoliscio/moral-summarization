SUMMARY: A central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people in its "war on terror." He highlights the hypocrisy in America's foreign policy, where it claims to denounce human rights violations yet supports Israel's violence against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights violators while rewarding those that comply. He asserts that America's actions are driven by its own strategic and economic interests rather than a genuine concern for human rights. Abbas concludes that people are no longer fooled by America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
