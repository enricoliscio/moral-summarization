SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, Seyed Qamar Abbas, strongly condemns the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no moral authority to judge other nations on human rights, given its own history of killing thousands of innocent people, particularly in the Muslim world, and its support for Israel's violence against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He believes the US report is motivated by its own strategic and economic interests rather than a genuine concern for human rights. Abbas asserts that the US employs a double standard, rewarding those who submit to its policies while labeling independent nations as human rights violators. He concludes that the people of the world are no longer fooled by America's unjust and discriminatory actions and statements. END OF SUMMARY.
