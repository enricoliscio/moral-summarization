SUMMARY: A senior leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas termed the report as unjust and discriminatory, stating that America itself is the violator of human rights, killing and injuring thousands of innocent people in its so-called war on terror. He highlighted the double standards of the US, condemning human rights violations while supporting Israel's atrocities against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argued that the US labels countries as human rights violators if they do not submit to its policies and accept its supremacy. He exposed America's self-interest in its war on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, stating that people are no longer in the dark and can see through its unjust and discriminatory policies. Abbas concluded that the world no longer believes in whatever America says.
