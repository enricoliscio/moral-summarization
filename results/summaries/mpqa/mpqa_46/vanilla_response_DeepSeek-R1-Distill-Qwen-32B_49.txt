Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first. It's about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's from the PPP and a former minister in NWFP. 

He's criticizing the US for their double standards. They talk about human rights violations but support Israel against Muslims. He mentions the US killing innocent people in the Muslim world and maltreating prisoners. 

The article also says that the US report labeled Iran and Pakistan as violators. Abbas argues that independent countries are labeled negatively, while those who follow US policies get favors. He believes the US is driven by strategic and economic interests, not genuine concern for human rights.

He's hopeful that people worldwide can see through the US's policies and don't believe their narratives anymore. 

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Abbas rejecting the report, his main points about US hypocrisy, their policies in the Middle East, and his views on the US's interests. I should end with his hope about global awareness. 

Let me structure it: introduce Abbas and his rejection, then his criticism of US policies, mention the countries named in the report, his point about independent nations, the US's hidden motives, and his conclusion about people seeing through their tactics. 

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.
