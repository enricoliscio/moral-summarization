SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own history of human rights violations. Abbas accused the US of killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He also criticized the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argued that independent nations that refuse to submit to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply are showered with favors. He claimed that the US follows its own strategic and economic interests, and that people are no longer deceived by its unjust and discriminatory policies. Abbas hopes that the world can see through America's motives and reject its biased reports.
