SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, rejected the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas criticized the US for its double standards and hypocrisy in denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions in Palestine and Lebanon. He accused the US of killing thousands of innocent people in its "war on terror" and maltreating prisoners of war. Abbas argued that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights violators, while favoring those that accept its supremacy. He concluded that people are no longer fooled by America's unjust and discriminatory policies and do not believe its claims.
