Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report on Iran and others. He accuses the US of being a human rights violator itself.

I notice the user provided a list of morally framed words that must be included. These include words like "violator," "killed," "guise," etc. My task is to ensure these words are present in the summary without making it too long, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll start by identifying the key points: Abbas's rejection of the report, the US's hypocrisy, the mention of killing innocents, the war on terror as a guise, mistreatment of prisoners, support for Israel, labeling of independent countries, and the US's strategic interests. I need to weave these points into a concise summary using the specified words.

I should structure the summary to first state Abbas's rejection, then his accusations against the US, followed by the implications of their policies, and conclude with his hope that people see through their actions. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included naturally within the sentences.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary elements. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: Seyed Qamar Abbas, a prominent Pakistani political figure, has strongly rejected the US State Department's human rights report, accusing America of being a violator of human rights itself. He criticized the United States for killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its so-called war on terror. Abbas highlighted the maltreatment of prisoners of war and the US's double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel in its actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He argued that independent nations not submissive to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those compliant with US policies receive favors. Abbas accused the US of pursuing strategic and economic interests under the pretext of combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He expressed hope that the world can no longer be kept in the dark about America's unjust and discriminatory policies, emphasizing that people increasingly recognize the US's hypocrisy. END OF SUMMARY.
