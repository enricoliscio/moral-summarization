SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own human rights violations. Abbas stated that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He accused the US of having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that refuse to submit to US policies are labeled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. He argued that the US follows its own strategic and economic interests, rather than genuinely fighting terrorism or promoting human rights. Abbas expressed hope that people worldwide are no longer deceived by America's unjust and discriminatory policies.
