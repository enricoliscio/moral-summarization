SUMMARY:
Former Pakistani provincial minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own history of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "so-called" war on terror. He criticizes America's "double standard policy", where it denounces human rights violations but supports Israel's "perishing" of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that refuse to submit to US policies are labelled as human rights violators, while those that comply are showered with "favours". He hopes that people can see through America's "unjust and discriminatory policies" and no longer blindly believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
