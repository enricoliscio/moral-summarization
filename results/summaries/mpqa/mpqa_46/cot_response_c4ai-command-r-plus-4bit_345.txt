SUMMARY:
Seyyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), has vehemently *rejected* the US State Department's report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights *violations*. In an interview with IRNA, Abbas asserted that the US has no moral ground to issue such a report when it has itself *killed* and *injured* thousands of innocent people worldwide, particularly in the Muslim world, under the pretext of its "war on terror." He *criticized* the US for its double standards, accusing it of *labelling* countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights *violators*. Abbas highlighted the US's *support* for Israel's *perishing* of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon, while *denouncing* human rights *violations* elsewhere. He also pointed out the *discrimination* in the US's treatment of countries, favoring those that *submit* to its policies. Abbas questioned the motives behind the US's so-called war on terrorism and its pursuit of strategic and economic interests. He expressed hope that the world can see through the US's unjust and *discriminatory* policies and no longer *believes* its claims.
