Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, a Pakistani political leader, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's criticizing the US for its double standards. He mentions that the US kills innocent people, especially in the Muslim world, under the guise of the war on terror. He also points out that the US supports Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argues that independent countries are labeled as human rights violators, while those compliant with US policies get favors. He believes the US's real motives are strategic and economic interests, not human rights. He hopes the world sees through America's policies.

I need to capture all these points concisely. The summary should highlight his rejection, the US's hypocrisy, the impact on Muslims, support for Israel, labeling of countries, and his hope for global awareness. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral criticism against the US.
