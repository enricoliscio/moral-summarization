SUMMARY: A Central Leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly rejected and criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations when it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed and injured thousands of innocent people in the Muslim world under the guise of its "war on terror." He exposes America's double standards, highlighting its support for Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that the US labels countries as human rights violators based on their independence and willingness to submit to its policies, rather than any genuine concern for human rights. He asserts that America's actions in the name of fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are driven by its own strategic and economic interests. Abbas concludes that the unjust and discriminatory policies of the US are visible to the people of the world, who no longer trust its words. END OF SUMMARY.
