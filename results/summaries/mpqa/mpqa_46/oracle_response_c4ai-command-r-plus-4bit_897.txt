SUMMARY: A senior leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations when it itself is guilty of violating human rights on a massive scale. He highlights the US's killing and injuring of thousands of innocent people in Muslim countries under the guise of the "war on terror," as well as its maltreatment of prisoners of war. Abbas condemns America's double standards, where it denounces human rights violations in some cases while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He believes that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as "human rights violators" to serve its own strategic and economic interests. Abbas concludes that the people of the world are no longer in the dark about America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer blindly accept its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
