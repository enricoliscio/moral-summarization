SUMMARY: Pakistan People Party leader Seyed Qamar Abbas denounced a recent US State Department report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argued that the US has no credibility to make such accusations, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people in its "war on terror" and supporting Israel's atrocities against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He criticized America's double standards and pointed out that countries that do not submit to US policies are often labeled as human rights violators. Abbas asserted that America's actions are driven by its own strategic and economic interests rather than a genuine concern for human rights. He expressed hope that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
