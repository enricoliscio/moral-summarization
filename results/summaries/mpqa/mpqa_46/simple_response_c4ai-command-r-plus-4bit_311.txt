SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and a former provincial minister, strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argued that the US has no credibility to issue such reports, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people, particularly in the Muslim world, under the pretext of its "war on terror." He denounced America's double standards, highlighting its support for Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas asserted that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as human rights violators, while rewarding those that accept its supremacy. He believes that the world is no longer ignorant of America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and people no longer blindly accept its claims. Abbas' stance challenges the moral authority of the US and emphasizes the need for an unbiased and ethical approach to human rights assessments. END OF SUMMARY.
