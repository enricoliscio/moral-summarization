SUMMARY:

Seyed Qamar Abbas, Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP), has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own human rights violations. He argues that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". Abbas criticizes the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He believes that countries that refuse to submit to US policies are labelled as human rights violators, while those that comply are rewarded. Abbas asserts that the US prioritizes its strategic and economic interests, and that people worldwide are no longer deceived by America's unjust and discriminatory policies.
