SUMMARY: A senior leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), Seyed Qamar Abbas, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations when it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed and injured thousands of innocent people, particularly Muslims, in its so-called war on terror. He condemns the US for its double standards, supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon while claiming to denounce human rights violations. Abbas believes that the US labels countries as human rights violators based on their independence and willingness to submit to its policies. He exposes America's self-interest in its war on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and hopes that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies. Abbas concludes that the US cannot keep the world in the dark anymore, as its actions and motives are transparent to the people.
