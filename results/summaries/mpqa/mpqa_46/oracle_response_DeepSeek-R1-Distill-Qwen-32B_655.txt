Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the provided morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He criticizes the US for being a human rights violator itself, mentioning their actions in the Muslim world, Afghanistan, and their support for Israel. He also talks about the double standards and how independent countries are labeled as violators.

I should identify the key points and the moral terms used. The main points are Abbas's rejection of the report, the US's hypocrisy, the killing and maltreatment of people, the double standard policy, support for Israel, labeling independent countries, and the covert motives behind the US's actions.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include words like violator, killed, guise, injured, maltreated, violators, denounces, violation, supports, perishing, labelled, dark, unjust, and discriminatory.

I'll structure the summary to first state Abbas's rejection, then his criticism of the US's actions and policies, and conclude with his hope that people recognize the US's injustices. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

Let me draft it:

Abbas rejects the US report, calling them violators. He mentions the US killing and injuring innocents under the guise of the war on terror. Criticizes their support for Israel and double standards. Labels independent nations as violators while favoring those who submit. Accuses the US of pursuing interests under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Hopes the world sees their unjust policies.

Now, I'll refine it to include all the moral terms and ensure clarity, keeping it concise.

SUMMARY:  
Seyed Qamar Abbas, a prominent Pakistani political leader, has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, accusing America of being a violator of human rights. He criticized the US for killing thousands of innocent people, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its so-called "war on terror." Abbas highlighted the maltreatment of Afghan civilians and prisoners of war, calling the US policies "unjust" and "discriminatory." He accused the US of a double standard, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel in its actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argued that independent nations not submissive to US dictates are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply receive favors. He claimed the US's war on terrorism is a pretext to advance its strategic and economic interests. Abbas expressed hope that the world can no longer be deceived by US injustices, as people increasingly recognize its discriminatory policies.  
END OF SUMMARY.
