Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The main figure is Seyed Qamar Abbas from the PPP in Pakistan, who's criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He's rejecting the report, saying the US has no right to judge others because they violate human rights themselves.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used: violator, killed, guise, injured, maltreated, violators, has, denounces, violation, supports, perishing, labelled, dark, unjust, discriminatory. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The article mentions the US killing innocent people, especially in the Muslim world, under the guise of the war on terror. They also maltreat prisoners. Abbas points out the double standard, supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He labels independent countries as violators and favors those who follow US policies. The US's true motives are strategic and economic interests, not human rights. Abbas hopes the world sees through their unjust policies.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure to use the moral terms. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me start by stating Abbas's rejection, then the US's actions, the double standard, labeling, and conclude with his hope about the world's awareness.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral tone. Let me draft it, then check the word count and the inclusion of the key terms.

SUMMARY:  
Seyed Qamar Abbas, a leader of Pakistan's PPP, has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, accusing America of being a violator of human rights itself. He criticized the US for killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of the "war on terror," while maltreating prisoners of war. Abbas condemned the double standard policy, where the US denounces human rights violations but supports Israel in perishing Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He argued that independent nations not submissive to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply are favoured. Abbas accused the US of prioritizing strategic and economic interests over human rights, asserting that its so-called fight against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction is a cover for its true motives. He expressed hope that the world can no longer be kept in the dark about America's unjust and discriminatory policies.  
END OF SUMMARY.
