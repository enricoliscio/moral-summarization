Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. Let me break it down.

First, the article starts by mentioning that Abbas, a PPP leader, rejects the US report on Iran and others. He accuses the US of being a human rights violator itself. I should note that he's from Pakistan and a former minister.

Next, he criticizes the US for killing innocent people, especially in the Muslim world, under the guise of the war on terror. He mentions Afghanistan and maltreatment of prisoners. That's a strong moral statement against US actions.

He also talks about the US's double standard policy, supporting Israel in Palestine and Lebanon, which is another moral point against US foreign policy. He labels independent countries as human rights violators if they don't follow US dictates, highlighting a power imbalance.

Abbas points out that the US's war on terrorism is a cover for strategic and economic interests, another critique of US motives. He ends on a hopeful note that people are seeing through US policies and not believing them anymore.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, keeping the moral critique intact. I'll structure it to include his rejection of the report, his accusations against the US, the double standards, and his hope for global awareness.

Let me check the word count. I'll keep each point brief but clear. Make sure the summary flows logically and doesn't exceed 200 words.

He argued that America, as a violator of human rights itself, has no moral authority to criticize others. Abbas criticized U.S. actions in Afghanistan and the Middle East, claiming they amount to killing innocent people under the guise of the "war on terror." He also accused the U.S. of supporting Israel's treatment of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon, while labeling independent nations that resist U.S. influence as human rights violators. Abbas emphasized that the U.S. prioritizes its strategic and economic interests over human rights, and he expressed hope that the global public is becoming aware of these injustices and no longer believes U.S. claims.  
END OF SUMMARY.
