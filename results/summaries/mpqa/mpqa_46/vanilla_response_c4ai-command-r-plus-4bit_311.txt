SUMMARY: Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP) and former provincial minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has strongly rejected the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas criticized the US for its hypocrisy and double standards, highlighting America's own violations of human rights, including the killing of thousands of innocent people in the Muslim world under the guise of the "war on terror." He accused the US of having a biased policy, favoring those who submit to its interests and labeling those who pursue true independence as human rights violators. Abbas also questioned the motives behind America's so-called war on terrorism and against weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that they are driven by strategic and economic interests. He expressed hope that the world can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer be deceived by its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
