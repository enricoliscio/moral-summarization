SUMMARY: In an interview with IRNA, Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, rejected the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas criticized the US for its double standards and hypocrisy in addressing human rights issues, arguing that the US itself is a violator of human rights, having killed and injured thousands of innocent people in its "war on terror." He accused the US of selectively targeting countries that do not submit to its policies and labeled them as human rights violators. Abbas also highlighted America's support for Israel's actions in Palestine and Lebanon as further evidence of its biased approach. He believed that the people of the world are no longer ignorant of America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer accept its claims at face value. Abbas concluded by emphasizing the need to expose America's hidden agenda and self-serving motives behind its actions. END OF SUMMARY.
