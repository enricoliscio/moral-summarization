Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and a list of morally framed words used by the author. My task is to summarize the article while preserving those moral terms. 

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report, accusing the US of being a human rights violator. He criticizes their double standards, especially regarding Israel and their policies in Muslim countries. 

Next, I should identify the key points: Abbas's rejection of the report, his accusations against the US, their policies in the Muslim world, support for Israel, and the strategic interests behind their actions. 

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words provided are: violator, killed, guise, injured, maltreated, violators, has, denounces, violation, supports, perishing, labelled, dark, unjust, discriminatory. 

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. For example, using "violator" when referring to the US, "killed" and "injured" when talking about their actions in Afghanistan. Also, mention how the US is "denouncing" human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while maintaining the moral framing. 

Now, putting it all together, I'll start by stating Abbas's rejection of the report, then his accusations about the US's actions and policies, followed by their double standards and the impact on independent nations. Finally, I'll conclude with his hope that the world sees through their policies.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and captures all the main points without being too verbose. Also, I should avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral terms provided.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all the key points and moral words are included. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
Seyed Qamar Abbas, the Central Leader of Pakistan People's Party (PPP), has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, accusing America of being a violator of human rights. He criticized the US for killing and injuring thousands of innocent people, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror." Abbas condemned the US for its double-standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He argued that independent nations not submitting to US supremacy are labelled as human rights violators, while those compliant receive favors. Abbas accused the US of prioritizing its strategic and economic interests over justice, claiming its so-called fight against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction is a cover for its true motives. He expressed hope that the world can no longer be kept in the dark about America's unjust and discriminatory policies, emphasizing that people no longer blindly believe its claims.  
END OF SUMMARY.
