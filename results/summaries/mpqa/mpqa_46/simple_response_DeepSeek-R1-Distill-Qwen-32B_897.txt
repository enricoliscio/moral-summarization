Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, a leader from the PPP in Pakistan, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's criticizing the US for having a double standard. They say other countries are violating human rights, but the US does the same or worse.

I should highlight his main points: the US's hypocrisy, their involvement in killing innocent people, especially in Muslim countries, and their support for Israel. Also, he mentions that independent countries are labeled as violators, while those who follow US policies get favors.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral stance against US policies. I'll start by stating Abbas's rejection, then outline his criticisms, and end with his hope that people are aware of the US's injustices.

Let me structure it: start with his rejection, mention the US's actions in the Muslim world, their support for Israel, the labeling of independent nations, and conclude with his hope about people's awareness.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural, within the word limit. Make sure the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the US's hypocrisy and the impact on human rights.
