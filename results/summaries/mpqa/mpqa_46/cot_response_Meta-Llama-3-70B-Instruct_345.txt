SUMMARY:
Former Pakistani minister Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own history of human rights violations. Abbas argues that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, and has a double standard policy when it comes to human rights. He criticizes the US for supporting Israel's "perishing" of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon, while labelling independent nations that don't submit to US policies as human rights violators. Abbas believes the US follows its own strategic and economic interests, and its policies are "unjust" and "discriminatory". He hopes that people can see through America's "unjust" policies and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
