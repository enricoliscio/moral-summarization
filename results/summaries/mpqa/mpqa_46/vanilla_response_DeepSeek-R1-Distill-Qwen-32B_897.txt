Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Seyed Qamar Abbas is the Central Leader of the PPP and a former minister in NWFP. He's rejecting the US report on human rights in Iran and other countries. He argues that the US has no right to make such a report because it's a violator of human rights itself. He points out that America has killed thousands of innocent people globally, especially in the Muslim world, under the guise of the war on terror. He mentions the maltreatment of prisoners of war and criticizes the US for having a double standard policy, supporting Israel in Palestine and Lebanon while denouncing others. He also says that independent countries not taking orders from the US are labeled as human rights violators, while those who comply get favors. Abbas believes the US is pursuing its interests, including strategic and economic motives, under the pretense of fighting terrorism. He hopes the world can see through America's policies and no longer believes their claims.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include who Seyed Qamar Abbas is, his rejection of the US report, his main criticisms about the US's human rights violations, the double standard, the labeling of independent countries, and his hope that the world recognizes the US's true motives.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with his position and the rejection, then listing his criticisms, and ending with his conclusion. I need to make sure it's concise and within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go.

Wait, the user provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide. Their summary is 108 words, so I can aim for something similar but ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding 200 words.

I think I have all the necessary points. Now, I'll put it together in a clear, concise manner.
