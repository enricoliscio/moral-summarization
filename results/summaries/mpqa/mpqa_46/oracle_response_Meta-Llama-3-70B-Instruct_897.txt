SUMMARY:

Pakistani leader Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, accusing America of being a violator of human rights itself. Abbas pointed out that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its so-called war on terror. He criticized the US for having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violation while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argued that countries that refuse to submit to US policies are labelled as human rights violators, while those that comply are showered with favors. He claimed that the US follows its strategic and economic interests, and its war against terrorism is a covert motive. Abbas expressed hope that people can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
