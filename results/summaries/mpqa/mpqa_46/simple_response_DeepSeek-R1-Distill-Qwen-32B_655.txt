Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's criticizing America for being a human rights violator itself. He mentions the US killing innocent people in the Muslim world, particularly in Afghanistan and Palestine. He also talks about double standards, supporting Israel while criticizing others. He labels independent countries as violators and those who comply get favors. He hopes the world sees through US policies.

I need to capture all these points succinctly. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by stating Abbas's rejection of the report, then his accusations against the US. I'll mention the war on terror, the double standards, and the strategic interests. Finally, I'll include his hope about the world realizing the truth.

I should make sure the moral framing is clear, highlighting the US's hypocrisy and Abbas's stance against it. Keeping the language concise but informative is key. Let me structure this step by step to ensure all main points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Seyed Qamar Abbas, the Central Leader of Pakistan People's Party (PPP), has condemned the US State Department's human rights report, accusing America of hypocrisy and double standards. He argued that the US, as a violator of human rights itself, has no right to criticize others. Abbas criticized the US for killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of the "war on terror," and for maltreating prisoners of war. He also accused the US of supporting Israel in its conflicts with Palestine and Lebanon while condemning human rights violations elsewhere. Abbas claimed that independent nations not submissive to US dictates are labeled as human rights violators, while those compliant receive favors. He asserted that the US prioritizes its strategic and economic interests over human rights. However, Abbas expressed hope that the world can no longer be deceived by US policies, as people increasingly recognize its unjust and discriminatory actions. END OF SUMMARY.
