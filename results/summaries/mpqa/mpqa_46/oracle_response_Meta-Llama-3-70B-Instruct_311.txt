SUMMARY:

Pakistan People Party leader Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, calling out America's hypocrisy. Abbas argued that the US has no right to judge others, as it is itself a violator of human rights, having killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world. He criticized the US for its double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas claimed that independent nations that refuse to submit to US dictates are labelled as human rights violators, while those who comply are rewarded. He accused the US of pursuing its strategic and economic interests under the guise of fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Abbas expressed hope that people are no longer blind to America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and that they can see through its deceit.
