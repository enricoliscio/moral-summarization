SUMMARY: Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province, has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report alleging human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas argues that the US has no credibility to make such accusations as it is itself a violator of human rights, citing the thousands of innocent lives lost due to US military interventions and the mistreatment of prisoners of war. He accuses the US of having a double standard policy, condemning human rights violations while supporting Israel's aggression against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that the US labels countries as human rights violators if they do not align with its policies and interests. He concludes that people are no longer ignorant of America's unjust and discriminatory policies and no longer blindly accept its statements.
