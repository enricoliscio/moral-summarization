Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, a Pakistani political leader, rejecting a US State Department report on human rights in Iran and other countries. He's criticizing the US for not having the right to make such a report because they themselves violate human rights. 

He mentions that America has killed many innocent people, especially in the Muslim world, under the guise of the war on terror. He also points out that the US supports Israel in Palestine and Lebanon, which he sees as a double standard. Abbas argues that countries independent from US influence are labeled as human rights violators, while those that follow US policies are favored. He believes the US is driven by strategic and economic interests, not genuine human rights concerns. He hopes the world can see through this and not believe the US's claims.

So, the summary should include the main points: Abbas rejecting the US report, criticizing US human rights violations, the double standard with Israel, labeling independent countries as violators, and the US's true interests. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure it to first mention Abbas and his rejection, then his criticisms of the US's actions and policies, and conclude with his hope about the world recognizing the US's true motives. I'll need to keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me make sure each key point is covered without going over the word limit.
