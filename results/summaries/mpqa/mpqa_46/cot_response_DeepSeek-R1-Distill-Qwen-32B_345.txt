Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, a Pakistani leader, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He accuses the US of being hypocritical because they violate human rights themselves. He mentions the US killing innocent people, maltreating prisoners, and supporting Israel against Muslims. He also talks about the US having a double standard and only accusing independent countries of human rights violations while favoring those who comply with US policies. He hopes people will see through the US's unjust policies.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again:

- Rejected
- Violator
- Killed
- Innocent
- Maltreated
- Double standard
- Denounces
- Perishing
- Independent
- Dictation
- Supremacy
- Labelled
- Favour
- Covert motive
- Unjust
- Discriminatory

I think these words carry moral weight in the context.

For the summary, I need to include these words as much as possible. I'll start by stating that Abbas rejected the US report, highlighting that the US is a violator. I'll mention the killing of innocents, maltreatment of prisoners, and the double standard. Then, I'll note his criticism of the US supporting Israel and the labeling of independent countries. Finally, I'll include his hope that people recognize the US's unjust policies.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.
