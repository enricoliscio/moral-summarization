SUMMARY:

Seyed Qamar Abbas, Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP), has strongly rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Iran and other countries, citing America's own record of human rights violations. Abbas accused the US of killing thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its so-called war on terror. He condemned the US for maltreating prisoners of war and supporting Israel's persecution of Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas criticized the US for its double standard policy, labelling independent nations that don't submit to its supremacy as human rights violators, while showering favors on those that comply. He argued that the US follows its strategic and economic interests, not genuine concern for human rights. Abbas expressed hope that people worldwide can see through America's unjust and discriminatory policies, and no longer believe its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
