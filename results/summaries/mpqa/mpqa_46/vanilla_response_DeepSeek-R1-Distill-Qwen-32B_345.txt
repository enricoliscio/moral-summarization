Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Seyed Qamar Abbas, the leader of the PPP in Pakistan, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's criticizing the US for having a double standard. They accuse other countries but are themselves guilty of human rights violations, especially in the Muslim world. He mentions the US killing innocent people in Afghanistan and mistreating prisoners. He also points out that the US supports Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argues that independent countries are labeled as human rights violators, while those who comply with US policies are favored. He believes the US is driven by strategic and economic interests, not genuine concern for human rights. He hopes the world sees through their policies and doesn't believe the US anymore.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: Abbas's rejection of the US report, criticism of US human rights violations, mention of Afghanistan and Israel, the double standard, labeling of independent countries, and his hope for global awareness.

I should structure it clearly, making sure each main point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll make sure to mention the US's actions, Abbas's specific criticisms, and his conclusion about global perception.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.
