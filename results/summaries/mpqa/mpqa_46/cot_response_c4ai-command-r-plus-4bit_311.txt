SUMMARY:
Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP) and a former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), has strongly *rejected* the US State Department's report on human rights violations in Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. Abbas *criticized* the US for its double standards, stating that it denounces human rights violations yet supports Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. He accused the US of being a *violator* of human rights itself, highlighting the thousands of innocent lives lost and the mistreatment of prisoners of war as a result of its "war on terror." Abbas argued that the US labels countries that do not submit to its policies as *human rights violators* while favoring those that accept its supremacy. He believes that the US pursues its own interests under the guise of fighting terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Abbas expressed hope that the world can see through the US's unjust and *discriminatory* policies and no longer be deceived by its claims. END OF SUMMARY.
