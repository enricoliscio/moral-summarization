SUMMARY: Seyed Qamar Abbas, a central leader of the Pakistan People Party (PPP), has vehemently rejected the US State Department's report accusing Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of human rights violations. Abbas asserted that the US has no moral ground to judge others when it has itself inflicted countless casualties and committed heinous acts in the name of its "war on terror." He condemned the US for its double standards and hypocrisy, pointing out that it denounces human rights violations yet turns a blind eye to Israel's atrocities against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas argued that the US employs a discriminatory approach, labeling countries that refuse to submit to its policies as "human rights violators" while rewarding those that obey with favors. He asserted that the world is waking up to America's unjust and self-serving agenda, driven by strategic and economic interests. Abbas' statement underscores a growing skepticism towards US moral authority on the global stage. END OF SUMMARY.
