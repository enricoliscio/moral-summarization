SUMMARY:

Pakistani politician Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected a US State Department report on human rights in Iran and other countries, accusing the US of being a violator of human rights itself. Abbas stated that the US has killed thousands of innocent people globally, particularly in the Muslim world, under the guise of its "war on terror". He criticized the US for having a double standard policy, denouncing human rights violations while supporting Israel's actions against Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon. Abbas believes that countries that don't submit to US policies are labeled as human rights violators, while those that do are showered with favors. He also accused the US of following its own strategic and economic interests, rather than genuinely fighting terrorism or weapons of mass destruction. Abbas expressed hope that people around the world can see through the US's unjust and discriminatory policies.
