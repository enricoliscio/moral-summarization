SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He claimed that the US seeks to "subjugate" the world community and is not ready to tolerate any "hurdle" in its pursuit of "hegemony." Gul accused the US of being the "most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country," citing its "barbarities" against Afghan people and its silence on the "brutal" killings of Indian Muslims. He argued that the US only sees human rights violations when a country or group becomes a "hurdle" to its "vested interests." Gul urged Muslim scholars to mount a "concerted moral resistance" against US influence and called on Muslim rulers to forge unity to resist US "hegemony." END OF SUMMARY.
