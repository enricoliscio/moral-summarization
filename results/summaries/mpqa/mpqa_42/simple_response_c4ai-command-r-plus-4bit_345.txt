SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report on human rights, alleging it is filled with lies and propaganda. He accuses the US of attempting to subjugate the world to its hegemony and disregarding human rights, decency, and religious values to pursue its interests. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine, arguing that the US turns a blind eye to these atrocities while accusing others of human rights violations when it suits its agenda. He warns that the US aims to crush Muslims globally and calls for Muslim scholars and rulers to unite and resist American influence, or risk being targeted individually. Hameed Gul's statements reflect a perspective that views the US as a morally corrupt imperialist force and advocates for a united Muslim response to protect their rights and values.
