SUMMARY: Former Pakistani ISI director-general Hameed Gul denounces the US State Department's human rights report as propaganda and a tool to enforce American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, or human rights, citing its actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and Palestinian Muslims as examples. Gul asserts that the US wants total submission from Muslims globally and warns of the need for moral resistance and unity among Muslim scholars and rulers to counter American influence. He emphasizes that the US and its allies use human rights as a pretext to serve their vested interests and suppress those who challenge their dominance. Gul's statements reflect a strong criticism of US foreign policy and its selective application of human rights concerns.
