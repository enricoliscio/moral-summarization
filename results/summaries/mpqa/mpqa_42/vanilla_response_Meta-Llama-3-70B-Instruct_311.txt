SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's 2023 report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, believes that the US targets countries that resist its hegemony, labeling them as human rights violators. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, or human rights, and of committing atrocities in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Gul also criticized the US for its silence on human rights abuses in India and Palestine, and for denying Muslims the right to defend themselves against oppression. He called for Muslim scholars to resist US influence and for Muslim rulers to unite against US hegemony, warning that if they remain divided, they will be crushed one by one.

END OF SUMMARY.
