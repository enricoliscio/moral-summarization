SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of seeking to "subjugate" the world community and using the report to further its "hegemonistic designs." Gul labeled the US as the "most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country" responsible for "barbarities" against innocent people. He criticized the US for its silence on human rights abuses in India and Palestine, where Muslims are being "brutally murdered" and "oppressed." Gul urged Muslim scholars to resist US influence and called for Muslim rulers to unite against "imperialist forces" led by the US. He warned that if they remain "indifferent," they will be "crushed one by one." END OF SUMMARY.
