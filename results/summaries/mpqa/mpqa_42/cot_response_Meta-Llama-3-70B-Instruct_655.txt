SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it a "pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He believes the report is a manifestation of the US's "hegemonistic designs" to subjugate countries that resist its influence. Gul accuses the US of being the "most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country" that has committed "barbarities" against innocent people, including Afghan civilians and Indian Muslims. He criticizes the US for its silence on human rights abuses in Palestine and India, and for denying Muslims the right to defend themselves against their oppressors. Gul warns that the situation requires a "concerted moral resistance" by Muslim scholars and rulers to resist US influence, lest they be "crushed one by one." END OF SUMMARY.
