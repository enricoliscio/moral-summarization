Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Hameed Gul is criticizing the US State Department's human rights report, calling it lies and propaganda. He accuses the US of hegemony and hypocrisy, pointing out their silence on issues in India and Palestine while focusing on countries that oppose them. He also calls for Muslim unity against US influence.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "lies," "propaganda," "force," "subjugate," "oppression," "murdered," "silence," "abuses," "submission," "plight," "crushed," and "forge" are central to the moral argument.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these terms. I'll structure the summary to highlight Gul's main criticisms: the US report's hypocrisy, their actions in Afghanistan and against Palestine, silence on India's violence, and the call for Muslim unity.

I'll start by stating Gul's rejection of the report, using "lies" and "propaganda." Then, mention the US's hegemonic designs and force. Include the oppression in Afghanistan and the hypocrisy regarding Palestine and India. Highlight the US's silence on human rights abuses and their denial of Palestinian rights. Conclude with Gul's call for moral resistance and unity among Muslims.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral framing words. I'll avoid adding any new information not in the article and keep the language clear and direct.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key moral terms are included appropriately. This approach should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of using force to subjugate the world and tolerate no resistance to its hegemony. Gul criticized the US for its hypocrisy, noting its silence on human rights abuses in India, where over 600 Muslims were murdered by extremist Hindus, and in Palestine, where Israel continues to oppress Muslims. He emphasized that the US only "sees" human rights violations when they hinder its vested interests. Gul condemned the US for denying Palestinians their right to an independent state, effectively forcing Muslims into submission. He warned that Muslim scholars and rulers must forge a concerted moral resistance to counter the ever-increasing US influence, or risk being crushed individually. The situation, he said, requires unity to resist imperialist forces and uphold religious and cultural values. END OF SUMMARY.
