SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul argues that the US labels countries that resist its hegemony as human rights violators, and that the report is a manifestation of the US's hegemonistic designs. He criticizes the US for having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and for committing atrocities against innocent people, including Afghans and Indian Muslims. Gul also points out the US's hypocrisy in ignoring human rights abuses in Palestine and India, while condemning those who resist its influence. He warns that Muslims must unite to resist US influence, or they will be crushed one by one. The solution to the Palestinian issue, according to Gul, is a free and independent state, but the US is denying this right to Muslims. The moral imperative is clear: Muslims must stand together against imperialist forces led by the US.
