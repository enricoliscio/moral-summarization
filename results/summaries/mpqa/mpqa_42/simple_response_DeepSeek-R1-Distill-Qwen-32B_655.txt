Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it "blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. He mentions the US wanting to subjugate the world and not tolerating any obstacles. 

He criticizes the US for not respecting religion, faith, norms, decency, and human rights. He brings up the US's actions in Afghanistan, using force against defenseless people, and the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims by extremist Hindus, which the US ignores. He also points out that the US is silent on Israel's actions in Palestine but condemns Palestinian reactions. 

Gul believes the US wants global Muslim submission and urges Muslim scholars and leaders to unite morally to resist US influence, warning that otherwise, they'll be targeted individually.

So, the main points are:
1. Hameed Gul rejects the US report as lies and propaganda.
2. The US labels resistant countries as human rights violators.
3. Criticism of US hypocrisy in human rights, especially regarding Afghanistan, India, and Palestine.
4. Call for Muslim unity against US influence.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral critique intact. I should make sure to include his accusations against the US, the specific examples, and his call to action for Muslims.

I'll structure it by starting with his rejection of the report, then outline his accusations, the examples, and conclude with his call for unity. I need to keep it concise but cover all key points.

Let me draft it:

Hameed Gul rejects the US human rights report as propaganda, accusing it of targeting countries resisting US hegemony. He criticizes the US for hypocrisy, citing its actions in Afghanistan, ignoring Indian Muslim killings, and remaining silent on Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He calls for Muslim unity to resist US influence, warning against division and urging moral resistance.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words.

Maybe expand a bit on each point, ensuring all key elements are present. Let me try again, ensuring each accusation and example is mentioned.

Hameed Gul, a Pakistani analyst, rejects the US human rights report as propaganda, arguing it targets countries opposing US hegemony. He accuses the US of hypocrisy, pointing to its actions in Afghanistan, ignoring Indian Muslim killings, and silence on Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He calls for Muslim unity to resist US influence, emphasizing moral resistance to avoid being targeted individually.

Still concise but covers all points. Maybe add that the US doesn't respect human rights and norms, and that Muslims should unite to defend themselves.

Final version:

Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, rejects the US human rights report as propaganda, accusing it of targeting countries opposing US hegemony. He criticizes the US for hypocrisy, citing its actions in Afghanistan, ignoring Indian Muslim killings, and silence on Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He urges Muslim unity to resist US influence, emphasizing moral resistance to prevent division and targeted oppression.

That should cover all the key points within the word limit.
