SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly condemned the US State Department's recent report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. Gul accuses the US of attempting to subjugate and forcibly impose its will on other nations, with no respect for human rights, religions, or cultural values. He points to the ongoing oppression and use of latest weaponry against the Afghan people, as well as the silence of the US and other nations on the recent killings of Indian Muslims, as evidence of America's fraudulent and extremist nature. According to Gul, the US deems any country or group that stands in the way of its vested interests as a violator of human rights, while remaining silent on the abuses committed by its allies such as Israel. He warns that the US wants total submission of Muslims globally and calls for moral resistance and unity among Muslim scholars and rulers to counter the ever-increasing US influence and targeted attacks on the community. The situation, he argues, requires a strong and united front to defend against the imperialist forces led by the US, or risk being crushed one by one.
