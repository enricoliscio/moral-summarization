SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. In an interview with IRNA, Gul, a former director-general of Pakistani ISI, said the US wanted to subjugate the world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in its pursuit of hegemony. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, or decency, and of committing barbarities against innocent Afghans. Gul also highlighted the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims, stating that extremist Hindus have brutally murdered hundreds of people while the US and other nations remain silent. He argued that the US sees human rights violations only when they interfere with its vested interests, and that it wants total submission from Muslims globally. He warned that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite and forge resistance against the ever-increasing US influence, or risk being crushed one by one. Gul's remarks reflect a strong sentiment of anti-US sentiment and a belief in American hegemony and oppression.
