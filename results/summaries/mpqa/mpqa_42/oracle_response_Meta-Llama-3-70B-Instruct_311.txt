SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He claims that the US seeks to "subjugate the entire world community" and labels countries that resist American hegemony as violators of human rights. Gul accuses the US of having "no respect for any religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules," and of being "the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country." He cites the US's actions in Afghanistan, where it "unleashed oppression" and committed "barbarities" against innocent people, and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and human rights abuses in Palestine. Gul warns that Muslims must resist US influence through "concerted moral resistance" and unity among Muslim rulers, or they will be "crushed one by one." He concludes that the US "wants total submission of Muslims across the globe."
