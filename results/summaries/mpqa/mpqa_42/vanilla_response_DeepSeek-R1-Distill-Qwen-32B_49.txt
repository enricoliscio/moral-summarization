Alright, I need to summarize this article about Hameed Gul's comments on the US State Department's human rights report. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Hameed Gul is a leading Pakistani defense analyst and a former ISI director. He's rejecting the US report, calling it lies and propaganda. He thinks the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. The US wants to dominate the world, and this report is part of that plan. He criticizes the US for not respecting religions, norms, and human rights. He mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan, using force and latest weapons, which caused suffering for Afghans, including women, children, and the elderly. He also brings up the recent violence against Indian Muslims, where over 600, mostly Muslims, were killed by extremist Hindus, but the US and others stayed silent. He points out that the US only sees human rights violations when it's against their interests. He uses the example of Israel in Palestine, where the US is silent about Israel's actions but condemns Palestinian reactions. He believes the solution is an independent Palestine, as per UN resolutions, but the US is against it. He warns that Muslims need to unite morally and politically to resist US influence; otherwise, they'll be targeted individually.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Gul's rejection of the report, his criticism of US hegemony, examples of US actions in Afghanistan and India, the Palestinian issue, and his call for Muslim unity. I'll make sure to include the key criticisms and the call to action.

I should structure it logically, starting with Gul's rejection, then his reasons, examples, and the conclusion about unity. Keep it concise, ensuring each sentence covers a main point without going into too much detail.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, I think this captures all the essential elements within the limit.

Gul criticized the US for using human rights as a tool to justify its hegemonic ambitions, particularly targeting countries that resist American influence.

He called for a unified Muslim response to counter US influence and urged adherence to UN resolutions for Palestinian independence. END OF SUMMARY.
