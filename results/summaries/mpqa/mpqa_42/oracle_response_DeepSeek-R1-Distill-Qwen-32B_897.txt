Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He's pretty critical of the US, calling their report lies and propaganda. 

First, I should identify the key points. He's saying that the US is using human rights as a tool to impose its hegemony. Countries that resist the US are labeled as human rights violators. He mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan, India, and Palestine as examples of hypocrisy. The US is accused of committing atrocities but staying silent on human rights abuses by its allies, like Israel.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words the author used. Words like lies, propaganda, force, subjugate, committed, oppression, murders, silent, violations, etc. These words are crucial for maintaining the moral tone.

I should structure the summary to cover Hameed Gul's main arguments: the US report is false, the US uses force to dominate, the hypocrisy in ignoring its own allies' actions, and the call for Muslim unity against US influence.

I also need to keep it concise, under 200 words. So, I'll start by introducing Gul and his rejection of the report, then outline his accusations against the US, provide examples, and conclude with his call for resistance.

I have to make sure the summary flows logically and includes all the key moral points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the author's framing.

Let me draft a rough version: Hameed Gul rejects the US report as lies and propaganda, accusing the US of using force to dominate. He points out the US's hypocrisy in ignoring its allies' human rights abuses, like in India and Palestine. He calls for Muslim unity to resist US influence, emphasizing moral resistance against oppression.

Wait, I should include more specifics, like the Afghan people, the 600 murdered Muslims in India, and the Palestinian issue. Also, mention the US's silence on these matters.

Putting it all together, ensuring I hit all the moral points and keep it within the word limit. I think that's a solid approach.

SUMMARY:  
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul strongly condemned the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of using force to subjugate the world and tolerate no resistance to its hegemony. Gul criticized the US for committing atrocities in Afghanistan and remaining silent on human rights violations by its allies, such as Israel in Palestine and extremist Hindus in India, where over 600 Muslims were brutally murdered. He argued that the US hypocritically ignores human rights abuses that serve its interests while targeting those who oppose its dominance. Gul emphasized that the US seeks the submission of Muslims globally and urged Muslim scholars and rulers to forge unity and resist the ever-increasing US influence, warning that inaction would lead to their crushing by imperialist forces. He stressed the need for concerted moral resistance to uphold religious and cultural values and achieve justice for oppressed peoples, such as Palestinians, who deserve a free and independent state as per UN resolutions.  
END OF SUMMARY.
