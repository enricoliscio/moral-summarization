SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries that resist its hegemony as human rights violators. Gul criticizes the US for having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and for committing atrocities against innocent people, including Afghan civilians and Indian Muslims. He points out the US's hypocrisy in remaining silent on Israel's human rights abuses in Palestine, while condemning Palestinian reactions. Gul warns that Muslims must unite and resist US influence, or they will be crushed one by one. He calls for a concerted moral resistance by Muslim scholars and rulers to forge unity and defend against imperialist forces led by the US.
