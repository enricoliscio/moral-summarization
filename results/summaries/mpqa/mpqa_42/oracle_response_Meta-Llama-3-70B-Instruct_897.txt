SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul argues that the US aims to "subjugate the entire world community" and labels any country that resists American hegemony as a violator of human rights. He accuses the US of having "no respect" for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being "the most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country." Gul points to the US's actions in Afghanistan, where it "unleashed oppression" and committed "barbarities" against innocent people. He also highlights the US's silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and Israel's human rights abuses in Palestine. Gul warns that Muslims must resist US influence and forge unity to avoid being "crushed one by one." He urges Muslim scholars to take a moral stand against the "ever-increasing" US influence.
