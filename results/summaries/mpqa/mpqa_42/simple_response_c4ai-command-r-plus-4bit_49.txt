SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul denounces the US State Department's annual human rights report as propaganda, alleging that it is used to further American hegemony and that it lacks any respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules. He asserts that the US is the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country, citing its actions in Afghanistan and silence on the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims and Israeli abuses against Palestinians as evidence. Hameed Gul warns of the need for moral resistance and unity among Muslim scholars and rulers to counter growing US influence and imperialism, arguing that submission to American interests will result in the crushing of Muslim nations one by one. He concludes that the US report is a tool to demonize countries that resist its global domination.
