Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. The article is about Hameed Gul's rejection of the US State Department's human rights report. He's a Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Hameed Gul is criticizing the US report as lies and propaganda. He argues that the US considers any resistance to its hegemony as human rights violations. He mentions the US's history of disregarding human rights and cultural values, especially in Afghanistan. He also brings up the situation in India with the killing of Muslims and the silence of the US and other nations. 

He points out the US's silence on Israel's actions in Palestine and criticizes their hypocrisy. He believes the US wants global Muslim submission and calls for a moral resistance from Muslim scholars and unity among Muslim leaders to counter US influence.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance against US hypocrisy and the call for solidarity. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the rejection of the report, the US's hegemonic designs, examples from Afghanistan, India, and Palestine, and the call for unity.

I'll structure it by starting with Gul's rejection, then his critique of the US's approach to human rights, the examples he uses, and his conclusion about the need for Muslim solidarity. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing, emphasizing the US's hypocrisy and the need for resistance.

Let me check the word count. I'll keep each sentence brief to stay within the limit. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, moving from the rejection to the critique and then to the call to action.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and captures all the essential points while maintaining the moral perspective.
