SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI chief Hameed Gul strongly criticizes the US State Department's human rights report, calling it propaganda and a tool to further American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, or international norms and points to the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine as examples of the US's selective silence on human rights abuses. Hameed Gul argues that the US and its allies have oppressed the Afghan people and that America's actions in the region are driven by self-interest. He calls for Muslim unity and resistance against US influence, warning that Muslim nations will be crushed if they do not collectively stand against imperialist forces. Hameed Gul's comments reflect a critical view of US foreign policy and its impact on global human rights and cultural values.
