SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report on human rights, calling it a tool of American hegemonistic propaganda. He argues that the US tries to subjugate any country that resists its influence and has no respect for religion, human rights, or cultural values. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine, which he believes is ignored by the US and its allies due to their vested interests. He warns that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite and morally resist American imperialism or risk being crushed one by one. He also advocates for an independent Palestinian state as per UN resolutions, which the US denies, showcasing its bias and double standards towards Muslims worldwide. Hameed Gul's stance reflects a strong moral position against perceived American hegemony and injustice towards Muslims.
