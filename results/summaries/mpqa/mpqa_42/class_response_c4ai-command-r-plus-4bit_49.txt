SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. He accuses the US of attempting to subjugate and forcibly impose its will on other nations, with no respect for their religious and cultural values. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine, where extremist Hindus and Israelis commit brutal murders and abuses with impunity, while the US remains silent. He argues that the US only accuses countries of human rights violations when it serves their vested interests. The analyst warns that the US wants total submission from Muslims and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite in moral resistance against this imperialist agenda or risk being crushed one by one. He concludes that the US is the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country, with no regard for human rights or decency. Its actions in Afghanistan, where it unleashed oppression and used the latest weaponry against a defenseless nation, are a testament to its hegemonic designs.
END OF SUMMARY.
