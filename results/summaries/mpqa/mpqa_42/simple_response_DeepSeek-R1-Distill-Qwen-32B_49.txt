Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, is criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it a pack of lies and propaganda. He's saying that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. He mentions the US's hegemonic designs and its lack of respect for religion, culture, and human rights.

He also talks about the US's actions in Afghanistan, calling them barbaric. He brings up the situation in India with Hindu extremists killing Muslims, which the US is ignoring. He points out that the US only notices human rights violations when they hinder its interests, like with Israel in Palestine. He argues that the US wants global Muslim submission and urges Muslim scholars and leaders to unite morally and resist US influence to avoid being crushed one by one.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it by highlighting Gul's rejection of the report, his critique of US hegemony, examples from Afghanistan and India, the US's selective concern for human rights, and his call for Muslim unity. I'll make sure to maintain the moral tone against US imperialism and the need for resistance.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, that's concise and covers all key points while preserving the moral framing. I think this should meet the requirements.
