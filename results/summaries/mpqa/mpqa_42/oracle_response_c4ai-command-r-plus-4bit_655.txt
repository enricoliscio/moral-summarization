SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's recent report on human rights as blatant propaganda and a tool to subjugate countries to American hegemony. He accused the US of having no respect for human rights, religion, or cultural values and of using force to oppress and commit atrocities against those who resist its influence. Hameed Gul highlighted the ongoing killings of Muslims in India and Israel's abuses against Palestinians, while the US remains silent, only speaking up when its vested interests are at stake. He warned that the US wants total submission from Muslims and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite in moral resistance against imperialist forces led by the US, or risk being crushed one by one. Hameed Gul's statements reveal a deep distrust of American intentions and a belief that the US is a fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist force in the world.
