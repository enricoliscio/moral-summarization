Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the language used.

The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it "blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. The US wants to subjugate the world and doesn't tolerate any obstacles, hence the report. He criticizes the US for not respecting religion, faith, norms, and human rights. He mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan, calling them fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist. He also brings up the recent violence against Muslims in India and the US's silence on it, as well as Israel's actions in Palestine. He believes the US wants global Muslim submission and urges Muslim scholars and leaders to resist collectively, warning that inaction will lead to being crushed one by one.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping as many of the morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: rejection of the report, US hegemony, human rights violations, US actions in Afghanistan, India, and Palestine, and the call for Muslim unity.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using words like "rejected," "blatant lies," "subjugate," "oppression," "fraudulent," "barbarities," "brutally murdered," "silent," "attacks," "submission," "resistance," "indifferent," "plight," "crushed," "forge," "influence," "targeted."

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary moral terms without being too verbose.

He condemned US actions in Afghanistan, describing them as barbarities against innocent civilians.
