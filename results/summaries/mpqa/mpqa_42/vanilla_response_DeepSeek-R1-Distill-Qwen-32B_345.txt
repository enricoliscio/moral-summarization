Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He's calling it "blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US is using human rights as a tool to impose its hegemony, targeting countries that resist American influence. 

He also criticizes the US for not respecting religions, cultures, and human rights. He mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan, using force and advanced weapons, and the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine. He points out that the US remains silent on these issues when it suits their interests but condemns others when it doesn't. 

Gul calls for Muslim unity and moral resistance against US influence, warning that if they don't unite, they'll be targeted one by one. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Gul's rejection of the report, his main criticisms, the examples he gives, and his call to action. Make sure it's concise and captures all key points without going into too much detail. 

Let me structure it: mention Gul's position, his criticism of the report, his view on US hegemony, examples from Afghanistan, India, and Palestine, the US's selective concern, and his call for unity. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
