SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it a "pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of wanting to "subjugate the entire world community" and using the report to further its "hegemonistic designs." Gul condemned the US for its "barbarities" against the Afghan people and its "oppression" against Muslims in India. He also criticized the US for its "silence" on Israel's human rights abuses in Palestine. Gul warned that the US wants "total submission" of Muslims worldwide and urged Muslim scholars to resist US influence through "concerted moral resistance." He concluded that Muslim rulers must unite to resist US hegemony, or they will be "targeted one by one." END OF SUMMARY.
