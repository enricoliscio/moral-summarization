SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the recent US State Department report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. He accuses the US of attempting to subjugate the world community through force and hegemonistic tactics, with no regard for religion, faith, human rights, or decency. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing oppression in Afghanistan and the killing of Indian Muslims as examples of the US's fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist nature, where vested interests take precedence over human lives. He also points out the double standards regarding human rights abuses, with the US turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities against Palestinians while condemning their reactions. According to him, the US demands submission from Muslims worldwide, and Muslim scholars and rulers must unite in moral resistance against these imperialist forces. Failure to do so, warns Hameed Gul, will result in their individual crushing. He concludes that unity is essential to counter the ever-growing US influence and targeted attacks on Muslim nations.
