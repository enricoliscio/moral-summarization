SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's 2023 report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, claims that the report is a manifestation of the US's hegemonic designs, targeting countries that resist American influence. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country. Gul cites the US's treatment of Afghan people, Indian Muslims, and Palestinians as examples of human rights abuses that the US ignores or downplays. He calls for Muslim scholars to resist US influence and for Muslim rulers to unite against American hegemony, warning that if they don't, they will be targeted one by one.
