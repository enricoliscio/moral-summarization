SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. He accused the US of attempting to subjugate the world community through force and having no respect for human rights and rules. Hameed Gul highlighted the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims and US silence on the issue, as well as US support for Israeli attacks on Palestinians, as examples of American hypocrisy and hegemony. He warned that the US wants total submission of Muslims globally and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite to resist American influence or face being crushed one by one. Hameed Gul's remarks come as a sharp critique of US foreign policy and its selective approach to human rights, exposing the underlying power dynamics and moral implications.
