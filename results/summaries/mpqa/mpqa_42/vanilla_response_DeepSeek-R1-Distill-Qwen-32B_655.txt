Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He's pretty harsh, calling it lies and propaganda. He thinks the US uses human rights as an excuse to impose its hegemony. 

I need to make sure I capture all the main points. He mentions the US not respecting any religion or norms, and points out their actions in Afghanistan. Also, he brings up the situation in India with the killings of Muslims and how the US isn't speaking up. He compares it to Israel's actions in Palestine, noting the US's silence there too. 

Gul suggests that the US only cares about human rights when it's in their interest. He calls for Muslim unity to resist US influence, warning that they'll be targeted otherwise. 

I should structure the summary to include his criticism, his reasons, the examples he uses, and his call to action. Keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed. 

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, I think this covers all the essential elements without going over the limit. The user wants it after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly.
