SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accuses the US of wanting to "subjugate the entire world community" and using the report to further its "hegemonistic designs." Gul asserts that the US has no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, or rules, and is the most "fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country." He cites the US's brutal treatment of Afghan people, women, and children, as well as its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims, as examples of its disregard for human rights. Gul argues that the US only sees violations of human rights when they interfere with its "vested interests." He urges Muslims to resist US influence and forge unity, warning that if they remain indifferent, they will be "crushed one by one." Gul concludes that the US wants "total submission of Muslims across the globe."
