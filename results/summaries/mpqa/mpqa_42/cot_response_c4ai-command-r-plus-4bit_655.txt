SUMMARY: 
Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a "pack of blatant lies." He accuses the US of trying to subjugate the world to its hegemonistic designs and having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, and decency. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine, which he says the US ignores due to its vested interests. He characterizes the US as fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist, committing barbarities and oppression in Afghanistan. Hameed Gul warns of the dangers of American influence, urging Muslim scholars and rulers to unite in moral resistance against imperialist forces. He concludes that the US seeks the submission of Muslims worldwide and that indifference to each other's plight will result in their being crushed individually.
