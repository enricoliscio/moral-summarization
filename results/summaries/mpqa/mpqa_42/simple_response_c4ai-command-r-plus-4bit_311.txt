SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul denounces the US State Department's recent human rights report as propaganda and a tool to further American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, or decency, citing its actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and Palestinian Muslims as examples of its hypocrisy. Hameed Gul warns that the US is attempting to subjugate Muslims globally and calls for Muslim scholars and rulers to unite in moral resistance against imperialist forces led by the US, or risk being crushed individually. He also advocates for a free and independent Palestinian state as enshrined in UN resolutions.
