SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's 2023 report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, believes the report is a manifestation of the US's hegemonic designs, targeting countries that resist American dominance. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of being the "most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country." Gul cited the US's actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims as examples of its hypocrisy. He also criticized the US's stance on the Palestinian issue, saying it denies Muslims the right to defend themselves against oppressors. Gul warned that Muslims must unite to resist US influence, or they will be targeted one by one.
