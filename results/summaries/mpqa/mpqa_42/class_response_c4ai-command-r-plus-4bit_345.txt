SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly rejected the recent US State Department report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. In an interview with IRNA, Gul, a former director-general of Pakistani ISI, said the US wants to subjugate the world community and will not tolerate any resistance to its hegemony. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, and decency, and of committing barbarities on innocent people in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Gul also drew attention to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims, where extremist Hindus have brutally murdered hundreds of people, while the US and other countries remain silent. He argued that the US selectively highlights human rights violations to serve its own interests and warned that Muslims worldwide are facing oppression and must unite to forge resistance against imperialist forces led by America, or risk being crushed individually. Hameed Gul's remarks reflect a strong criticism of US foreign policy and its alleged disregard for human rights and religious values in the region. END OF SUMMARY.
