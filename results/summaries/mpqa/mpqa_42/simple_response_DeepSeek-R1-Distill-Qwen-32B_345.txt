Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it "blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. He mentions the US's hegemonic designs and its lack of respect for religion, faith, and human rights. He also brings up the US's actions in Afghanistan, India, and Palestine, highlighting the US's silence on human rights abuses in these regions when it suits their interests. He calls for Muslim unity against US influence.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Gul's rejection of the report, the US's hegemony, examples of hypocrisy (Afghanistan, India, Palestine), and his call for Muslim unity. I must maintain the moral critique against the US's actions and the call for resistance.

I should structure the summary to first state Gul's rejection, then explain his reasons, provide examples, and conclude with his call to action. Keeping it concise but covering all critical aspects without losing the moral framing.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included succinctly.

He condemned the US for supporting Israel's actions against Palestinians while condemning Palestinian resistance. Gul emphasized the need for Muslim unity to resist US influence, warning that inaction would lead to further oppression. He stressed the importance of moral resistance and unity among Muslim scholars and leaders to counter imperialist forces. END OF SUMMARY.
