SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries that resist its hegemony as human rights violators. Gul accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, or human rights, and of being the most "fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country" in the world. He cites the US's actions in Afghanistan and its silence on India's persecution of Muslims and Israel's occupation of Palestine as examples of its hypocrisy. Gul warns that Muslims must resist US influence and unite to defend themselves against imperialist forces, or they will be crushed one by one. He urges Muslim scholars to take a moral stand against US aggression and for Muslim rulers to forge unity to resist US influence.
