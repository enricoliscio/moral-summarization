SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's latest human rights report, calling it a pack of "blatant lies and propaganda." Hameed Gul argues that the report is a tool to further American hegemony and that the US is attempting to subjugate the world through force. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, or rules, and of committing barbarities and oppression in Afghanistan and Palestine. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims and the silence of the US and other nations, exposing their hypocrisy on human rights. He believes that the US views Muslims as oppressors and seeks their total submission. He warns of the dangers of indifference among Muslim scholars and rulers, urging them to unite and morally resist the imperialist forces led by the US, or else face being crushed and targeted individually. Hameed Gul concludes that the US is the world's most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country.
