Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the strong moral language used.

The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, rejecting the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it "blatant lies and propaganda." He's criticizing the US for using human rights as a tool to exert hegemony, meaning they're trying to control other countries. He mentions that the US doesn't respect any religion, faith, or human rights, and that it's unprecedented for a country to force others to give up their cultural values.

He also talks about the US's actions in Afghanistan, using advanced weapons and committing atrocities against innocent people. He brings up the ongoing violence against Indian Muslims by extremists, noting that the US and other nations are silent. He points out that the US only sees human rights violations when it's against their interests, like in Palestine where Israel is abusing rights but the US remains silent. He argues that the US wants global submission from Muslims and urges scholars and rulers to unite against US influence to avoid being crushed individually.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The list provided includes words like lies, propaganda, force, subjugate, etc. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by outlining the main points: rejection of the report, US hegemony, disregard for rights, actions in Afghanistan, silence on India and Palestine, call for Muslim unity.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step.

1. Hameed Gul rejects the US report, calling it lies and propaganda.
2. Criticizes US for using human rights to subjugate others, unable to tolerate resistance.
3. Accuses US of not respecting religion, faith, or human rights, unprecedented in history.
4. Mentions US's role in Afghanistan's suffering and silence on India's violence against Muslims.
5. Points out US's silence on Israel's abuses in Palestine, only caring when it suits their interests.
6. Argues US wants Muslim submission, urging scholars and rulers to unite to resist US influence and avoid being targeted.

Now, I'll craft the summary using these points and the moral terms provided, ensuring it's concise and within the word limit.
