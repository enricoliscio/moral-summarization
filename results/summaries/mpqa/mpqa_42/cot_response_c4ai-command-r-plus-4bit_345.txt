SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a propaganda piece that serves American hegemonistic designs. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, human rights, or decency, and of using force to subjugate the world community to its will. Hameed Gul highlighted the ongoing oppression in Afghanistan and the killing of Indian Muslims as examples of the US's selective silence on human rights abuses. He believes that the US and its allies have unleashed oppression and committed barbarities on defenseless people to serve their vested interests. Hameed Gul warned of the US's intention to achieve the total submission of Muslims and called for moral resistance from Muslim scholars and unity among Muslim rulers to counter the ever-increasing US influence and imperialist agenda. He asserted that the US denies the Palestinian people their right to an independent state and justifies Israeli abuses, demonstrating a clear bias and disregard for Muslim lives and rights. Hameed Gul's statements reflect a strong stance against American hegemony and the perceived targeting of Muslims worldwide.
