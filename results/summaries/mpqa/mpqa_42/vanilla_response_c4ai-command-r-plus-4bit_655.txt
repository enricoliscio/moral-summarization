SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul strongly criticizes the US State Department's human rights report, calling it propaganda and a tool to further American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, norms, or human rights, citing the country's actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims and Israeli abuses against Palestinians as examples. Gul believes that the US views countries and groups that stand in the way of its interests as human rights violators and seeks total submission from Muslims worldwide. He warns of the need for Muslim scholars and rulers to unite and resist increasing US influence, or risk being crushed individually. Hameed Gul's remarks highlight a critical perspective on US foreign policy and its perception in the region.
