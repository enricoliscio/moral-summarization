Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long, maybe around 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Hameed Gul is a Pakistani analyst criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it lies and propaganda. He argues that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. The US wants to subjugate the world and can't tolerate any obstacles. He mentions the US not respecting religion, faith, and human rights. He brings up the US's actions in Afghanistan, using force and latest weapons. He also points out the ongoing violence against Indian Muslims and the US's silence on that. He criticizes the US for ignoring human rights abuses by Israel in Palestine but reacting when Palestinians resist. He calls for Muslim unity and moral resistance against US influence, warning that without unity, they'll be crushed one by one.

Now, I need to condense this, using the moral words provided. I should start with Hameed Gul rejecting the report as lies and propaganda. Mention the US's hegemony and subjugation. Highlight the US's disrespect for values and its actions in Afghanistan and India. Include the silence on human rights issues. Critique the US's stance on Israel and Palestine. Conclude with the call for unity and resistance.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.
