SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He believes that the US aims to "subjugate" the world community and is not willing to "tolerate" any hurdles in its pursuit of hegemony. Gul accuses the US of having no "respect" for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules. He labels the US as "fraudulent," "terrorist," and "extremist," citing its "barbarities" against innocent Afghan people, women, children, and the elderly. Gul also condemns the US for its silence on the "killings" of Indian Muslims and "abuses" in Palestine. He argues that the US only sees "violations" of human rights when a country or group becomes an obstacle to its interests. Gul urges Muslims to forge unity and resist US influence, warning that if they remain "indifferent" to each other's plight, they will be "crushed" one by one. He calls for a "concerted moral resistance" against US imperialism.
