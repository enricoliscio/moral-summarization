SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly rejected the recent US State Department report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. In an interview with IRNA, Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani ISI, criticized American hegemony and its disrespect for human rights and religious values worldwide. He accused the US of using force to subjugate other nations and committing barbarities in Afghanistan. Gul also highlighted the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims, with over 600 people brutally murdered by extremist Hindus, while the US remains silent. He believes the US sees human rights violations only when its vested interests are threatened and is quick to deem Muslims as oppressors. According to Gul, America wants total submission from Muslims, and Muslim scholars and rulers must unite in moral resistance to avoid being crushed by imperialist forces. He concluded that the US is the most fraudulent and extremist country, with no respect for human life and religious freedom.
