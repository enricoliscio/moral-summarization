SUMMARY:
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it a "pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of seeking to "subjugate" the world community and using human rights as a pretext to justify its "hegemonistic designs." Gul condemned the US as the "most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country," citing its "barbarities" against Afghan civilians and its silence on Indian Muslim killings. He argued that the US only sees human rights "violations" when countries resist its "vested interests." Gul urged Muslim scholars to mount a "concerted moral resistance" against US influence, warning that if they remain "indifferent" to each other's plight, they will be "crushed one by one." He called for Muslim rulers to unite against US "imperialist" forces. END OF SUMMARY.
