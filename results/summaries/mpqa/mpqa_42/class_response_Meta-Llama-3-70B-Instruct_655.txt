SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul argued that the US seeks to "subjugate" the world community, and its report is a manifestation of its "hegemonistic designs." He claimed that the US has no "respect" for religion, faith, or human rights, and is the most "fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist" country. Gul pointed to the US's "barbarities" in Afghanistan and its silence on the "brutal" killings of Indian Muslims. He accused the US of "oppression" and "violations" of human rights, particularly against Muslims, and warned that if Muslims remain "indifferent" to each other's plight, they will be "crushed" one by one. Gul urged Muslim scholars to forge a "concerted moral resistance" and Muslim rulers to unite against US influence, lest they be "targeted" individually.
