SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul argues that the US targets countries that resist its hegemony, labeling them as violators of human rights. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of forcibly preventing countries from upholding their cultural values. Gul condemns the US for its "barbarities" against the Afghan people and its silence on the "brutal murders" of Indian Muslims. He also criticizes the US for its double standard on human rights, remaining silent on Israel's abuses in Palestine while condemning Palestinian reactions. Gul warns that the US seeks "total submission" of Muslims worldwide and urges Muslim scholars to resist US influence through "concerted moral resistance." He advises Muslim rulers to forge unity to counter US dominance, lest they be "targeted one by one." END OF SUMMARY.
