SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly condemned the US State Department's recent report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US targets countries that resist its hegemony, labeling them as human rights violators. Gul accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of committing atrocities against innocent people, including Afghan civilians and Indian Muslims. He also criticizes the US for its silence on Israel's human rights abuses in Palestine. Gul warns that the US seeks total submission of Muslims globally and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite to resist US influence, or they will be crushed one by one. He advocates for a free and independent state for the Palestinian people, as enshrined in UN resolutions. Gul's scathing critique of US foreign policy and human rights hypocrisy serves as a call to action for Muslims to resist imperialist forces.
