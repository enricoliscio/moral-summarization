SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul strongly criticizes the US State Department's human rights report, calling it propaganda and a tool to further American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, norms, or human rights, pointing to its actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Muslims in India and Palestine. Hameed Gul argues that the US only condemns human rights violations when they hinder its interests and warns that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite to resist American influence or face crushing consequences. He concludes that the US seeks total submission from Muslims worldwide.
