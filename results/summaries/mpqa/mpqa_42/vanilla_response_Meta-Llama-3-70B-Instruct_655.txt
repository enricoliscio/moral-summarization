SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has rejected the US State Department's 2023 report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." Gul, a former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), believes the report is a manifestation of the US's hegemonistic designs. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules, and of committing atrocities against innocent people, including Afghan civilians and Indian Muslims. Gul argues that the US only sees human rights violations when a country or group becomes a hurdle to its vested interests, citing the example of Israel's actions in Palestine. He warns that Muslims must unite to resist US influence, or they will be targeted one by one. Gul concludes that the logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state, but the US is denying this.
