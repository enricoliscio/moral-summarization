SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI chief Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. Hameed Gul accused the US of trying to subjugate the world community by force and having no respect for human rights and rules. He said the US was committing atrocities in Afghanistan and supporting oppression against Muslims in Palestine and India. The analyst argued that the US was quick to accuse others of human rights violations when it suited their vested interests but remained silent when Muslims were being oppressed. Hameed Gul warned that the US wanted total submission from Muslims and that Muslim scholars and rulers needed to unite in moral resistance against American hegemony. He concluded that the ever-increasing US influence was a threat to Muslim nations, who would be targeted and crushed one by one if they did not forge unity.
