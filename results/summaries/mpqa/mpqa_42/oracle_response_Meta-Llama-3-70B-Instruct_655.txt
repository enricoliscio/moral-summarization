SUMMARY:

Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of wanting to "subjugate the entire world community" and using the report to further its "hegemonistic designs." Gul claimed the US has no respect for religion, faith, or human rights, and is the "most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country" that has committed "barbarities" against innocent people. He pointed to the US's silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and Israel's human rights abuses in Palestine, while condemning countries that resist American influence. Gul urged Muslims to forge unity and resist US influence, warning that if they remain indifferent, they will be "crushed one by one." He called for a "concerted moral resistance" against the US's "ever-increasing influence" and its attempts to deny Muslims the right to defend themselves against oppression.
