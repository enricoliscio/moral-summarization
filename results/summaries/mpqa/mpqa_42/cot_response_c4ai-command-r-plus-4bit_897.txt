SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. He accuses the US of trying to subjugate countries that resist its hegemony, showing no respect for religion, faith, human rights, and rules. Hameed Gul highlights the ongoing oppression and use of force against Muslims in Afghanistan, Palestine, and India, with the US turning a blind eye to these atrocities and even justifying Israeli abuses. He warns that the US wants total submission from Muslims and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite in moral resistance against these imperialist forces, or else face being crushed and targeted individually. Hameed Gul's statement concludes by emphasizing the need for unity among Muslim rulers to resist the growing US influence and hegemony. END OF SUMMARY.
