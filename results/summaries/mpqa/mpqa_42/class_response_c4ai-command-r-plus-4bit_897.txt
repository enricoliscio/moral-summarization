SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly condemned the US State Department's recent report on human rights, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. In an interview with IRNA, Gul, a former director-general of Pakistani ISI, accused the US of attempting to subjugate the world community and having no respect for human rights and rules. He highlighted the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims, where over 600 people were brutally murdered by extremist Hindus, while the US remained silent. Gul believes that the US deems countries or groups as violators of human rights when they become obstacles to its vested interests. He also criticized America's stance on the Palestinian issue, stating that Muslims are denied the right to defend themselves against oppressors and are expected to submit to American hegemony. Hameed Gul warned Muslim rulers to unite and resist the growing US influence, or risk being targeted and crushed one by one. He concluded that the situation calls for moral resistance and unity among Muslim scholars and rulers to stand against imperialist forces led by the US.
