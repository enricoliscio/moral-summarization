SUMMARY:

Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul rejects the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He claims the US seeks to "subjugate" the world community, using human rights as a pretext to justify its "hegemonistic designs." Gul accuses the US of having "no respect" for religion, faith, or human rights, and of being "the most fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist country." He cites the US's actions in Afghanistan, where it "unleashed oppression" and committed "barbarities" against innocent people. Gul also points to the US's silence on India's brutal killings of Muslims and Israel's "worst examples of rights abuses" in Palestine. He warns that the US seeks "total submission" of Muslims worldwide and urges Muslim scholars to resist this oppression through "concerted moral resistance." If they remain "indifferent" to each other's plight, they will be "crushed one by one." Gul concludes that Muslim rulers must "forge unity" to resist US influence.
