Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The article is about Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He's calling it a pack of lies and propaganda. He mentions that the US is using human rights as a tool to dominate other countries. 

He also talks about the US not respecting any religion or norms, and points out the hypocrisy in their stance on countries like India and Israel. For example, he brings up the violence against Muslims in India and the ongoing conflict in Palestine. He's critical of the US for being silent on these issues when it suits their interests but quick to judge others when it doesn't.

Gul suggests that Muslims need to unite and resist US influence through moral and scholarly efforts. He believes that if they don't, they'll be targeted one by one. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points. I'll start by introducing Gul and his main criticism of the report. Then, mention the US's hegemony and hypocrisy. Include examples like India and Palestine. Finally, note his call for unity among Muslims to resist US influence. I should keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown or extra formatting as per the instructions.
