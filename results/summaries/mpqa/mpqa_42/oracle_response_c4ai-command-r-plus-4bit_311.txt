SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul has strongly criticized the US State Department's recent human rights report, calling it a pack of blatant lies and propaganda. In an interview with IRNA, Gul, a former director-general of Pakistani ISI, said the US wants to subjugate the world community and will not tolerate any hurdle in its path. He accused the US of having no respect for religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, or rules, and of committing barbarities against innocent Afghans. Gul also highlighted the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims, with over 600 people brutally murdered by extremist Hindus while the US remained silent. He believes that the US sees human rights violations only when they interfere with its vested interests. The analyst warned that the US is seeking total submission from Muslims worldwide and that Muslim scholars and rulers must unite to resist American hegemony, or else they will be crushed one by one. Hameed Gul's remarks shed light on the perceived moral double standards and hegemonic intentions of the US, urging Muslims to forge unity in the face of growing US influence and oppression.
