Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The article is about Hameed Gul rejecting the US State Department's human rights report, calling it lies and propaganda. He's critical of the US's hegemonic approach and their double standards on human rights.

First, I should identify the key points: Gul's rejection of the report, his criticism of US hegemony, the mention of Afghan people suffering, the killings in India, Israel's actions in Palestine, and his call for Muslim unity against US influence.

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible, like lies, propaganda, subjugate, oppression, murdered, silent, etc. I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Gul's rejection, moving through his criticisms, and ending with his call to action.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral stance against US policies and actions. I'll need to paraphrase some parts but keep the strong moral language intact.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered without losing the moral framing. I'll start with Gul's rejection, then his broader critique, examples of US actions, and conclude with his advice for Muslims to unite.

SUMMARY:  
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul strongly rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of using force to subjugate the world and tolerate no obstacles to its hegemony. Gul criticized the US for its hypocrisy, pointing out its silence on human rights abuses, such as the killings of Muslims in India and Israel's actions in Palestine. He condemned the US for its role in unleashing oppression on defenseless nations, including Afghanistan, and for denying the Palestinian people their right to an independent state. Gul emphasized that the US wants total submission from Muslims globally and urged Muslim scholars and leaders to forge unity to resist increasing US influence, warning that inaction would lead to their crushing one by one. He stressed the moral imperative for collective resistance against imperialist forces.  
END OF SUMMARY.
