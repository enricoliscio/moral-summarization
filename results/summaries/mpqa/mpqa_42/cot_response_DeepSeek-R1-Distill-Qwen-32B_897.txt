Alright, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a detailed news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. That means looking for words that carry strong positive or negative connotations related to ethics or values.

I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph. The analyst Hameed Gul is rejecting the US State Department report, calling it "blatant lies" and "propaganda." Those are strong negative terms. He mentions "American hegemony," which implies dominance, a negative framing. He also talks about the US not tolerating "hurdles," so "hurdles" here are seen negatively as obstacles to US goals.

Next, he accuses the US of having no respect for "religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights, and rules." All these are positive concepts, so their absence is a moral failing. He describes the US as "fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist," which are clearly negative. He mentions "barbarities" committed against Afghans, a strong negative term.

He points out the US's silence on the killings of Indian Muslims by "extremist Hindus," using another negative term. He also criticizes the US for being silent on Israeli actions in Palestine, highlighting "rights abuses." He warns about the need for "moral resistance" and "unity" among Muslims, which are positive actions. Finally, he talks about "imperialist forces" and the need for "resistance."

Now, compiling all these words, I list them each with an asterisk. Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture Hameed Gul's main points: rejecting the US report, criticizing US hypocrisy on human rights, the situation in India and Palestine, and the call for Muslim unity against US influence.

I'll structure the summary to first state his rejection of the report, then explain his accusations against the US, mention the specific examples in India and Palestine, and conclude with his call for moral resistance and unity. This way, I preserve the moral framing while keeping it concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul strongly condemned the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "blatant lies and propaganda." He accused the US of using human rights as a tool to justify its hegemonic ambitions, targeting countries that resist American dominance. Gul criticized the US for its hypocrisy, noting its silence on human rights abuses in India, where extremist Hindus have killed over 600 Muslims, and in Palestine, where Israel's actions against Muslims are ignored. He described the US as a "fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist" nation, citing its barbarities in Afghanistan and its refusal to allow Palestinians a free state as per UN resolutions. Gul warned that Muslims must unite and resist US influence morally, or face division and destruction.  

END OF SUMMARY.
