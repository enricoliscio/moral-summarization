SUMMARY: Leading Pakistani defense analyst and former ISI director-general Hameed Gul strongly criticizes the US State Department's human rights report, calling it propaganda and a tool to further American hegemony. He accuses the US of having no respect for religion, norms, or human rights, pointing to its actions in Afghanistan and its silence on the killings of Indian Muslims and Palestinian Muslims' plight. Hameed Gul argues that the US only condemns human rights violations when they hinder its interests and calls for Muslim unity and resistance against American influence. He warns of the crushing of Muslim nations if they remain indifferent to each other's struggles against imperialist forces.
