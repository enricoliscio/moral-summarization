Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. Hameed Gul, a Pakistani defense analyst, is criticizing the US State Department's human rights report. He calls it "blatant lies and propaganda." He argues that the US labels countries resisting its hegemony as human rights violators. 

I need to make sure I include all the morally charged words the author used. Words like "lies," "deemed," "subjugate," "tolerate," "respect," etc. I should structure the summary to reflect his main points: US hypocrisy, double standards, and the impact on countries like Afghanistan and Palestine. 

He mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan and the ongoing violence against Muslims in India and Palestine. It's important to highlight his call for Muslim unity and resistance. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, using those key terms to maintain the moral tone.

SUMMARY: Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul condemned the US State Department's human rights report as "blatant lies and propaganda," accusing the US of hypocrisy and double standards. He argued that countries resisting American hegemony are unfairly deemed human rights violators, with the US seeking to subjugate the global community and tolerate no opposition. Gul criticized the US for forcibly preventing nations from upholding religious and cultural values, calling it unprecedented in history. He accused the US of being fraudulent, terrorist, and extremist, citing its barbarities in Afghanistan and silence over the brutal killings of Muslims in India and Palestine. Gul emphasized that the US only sees human rights violations when they hinder its interests, while remaining silent on Israeli abuses in Palestine. He called for concerted moral resistance from Muslim scholars and unity among Muslim leaders to counter US influence, warning that inaction would lead to their crushing by imperialist forces. END OF SUMMARY.
