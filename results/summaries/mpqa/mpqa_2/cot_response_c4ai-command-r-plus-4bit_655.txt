SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed his country's strong disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. He emphasized that such malicious wording is detrimental to global peace and stability. China stands firm in its belief that anti-terrorism efforts should be grounded in irrefutable evidence and not arbitrarily expanded. Kong asserted that state-to-state relations ought to be governed by the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful coexistence, and equal treatment of all nations. China's position highlights its commitment to maintaining world peace and its disapproval of the harmful consequences that may arise from the use of such sinister labels. This statement comes in response to the U.S. leader's description of the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq as an "axis of evil," which has sparked differing opinions in American media and among the public. China's stance underscores its belief in ethical diplomacy and its opposition to divisive language that could have far-reaching implications. END OF SUMMARY.
