Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article is about China disapproving of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The author used words like expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, and peace. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read the article again to understand the main points. China's foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan comments on the U.S. leader's use of "axis of evil" regarding North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. He disapproves of such terminology. He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with the wording, and following that logic could have serious consequences. He emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence and not expanded without reason. He also stresses the importance of following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace and stability.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating China's disapproval of the term. Then mention Kong Quan's comments on the U.S. public's disagreement and the potential serious consequences. Next, highlight China's stance on anti-terrorism based on evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Finally, include the emphasis on following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace.

I should make sure to include the morally framed words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. Let me structure the sentences to incorporate these words naturally. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the summary concise.

Putting it all together, I'll start with China's disapproval, mention Kong Quan's comments, the U.S. public's stance, the consequences, the anti-terrorism points, and the principles for international relations. That should cover all the key points while preserving the moral framing.

He emphasized that such terminology risks serious consequences if its logic is followed, as it could expand anti-terrorism efforts without sufficient evidence.

He reiterated that anti-terrorism efforts must be grounded in irrefutable evidence and should not be arbitrarily expanded. China believes that adhering to these principles is essential for safeguarding global and regional peace and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
