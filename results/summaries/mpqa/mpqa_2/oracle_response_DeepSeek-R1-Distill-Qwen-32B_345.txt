Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and specified certain morally framed words to include: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. The summary should be under 200 words and include these terms.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of using "axis of evil" in international relations. He comments on US leaders labeling North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. He mentions that US public opinion doesn't agree with the term and that using it could lead to serious consequences. He emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence, not expanded arbitrarily. He also stresses following UN principles and treating countries equally, which is key for peace and stability.

Now, I need to condense this, making sure to include the moral words. I'll start by stating China's disapproval of the term. Mention Kong Quan's comments on US leaders and public opinion. Highlight the potential serious consequences. Then, address the anti-terrorism point, using "expanded" to show not extending it without reason. Finally, stress the importance of following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace.

I should structure it clearly, maybe in a few sentences, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure each moral term is included naturally in the summary.
