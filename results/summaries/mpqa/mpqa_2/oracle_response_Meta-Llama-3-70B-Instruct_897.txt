SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, emphasizing that such language can have serious consequences if its logic is followed. Kong stressed that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not be expanded arbitrarily. He emphasized the importance of handling state-to-state relations in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment for all countries. This approach, Kong argued, is the only way to ensure long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions, and to safeguard peace. By promoting a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to international relations, China aims to follow a path that prioritizes cooperation and mutual respect over divisive rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
