SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan, the term is not acceptable and its consequences could be serious if taken to its logical conclusion. China believes that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on solid evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. The country emphasizes the importance of handling state-to-state relations in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment of all nations. This approach is seen as essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally. The spokesman's comments were made in response to a statement by a US leader that referred to North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations.
