SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing concerns that it may lead to serious consequences if followed logically. Kong emphasized that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. He stressed that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment for all countries. This approach is essential for safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. Kong's comments come after the US leader described the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations, a term that has been met with disapproval from the Chinese government and parts of the US public.
