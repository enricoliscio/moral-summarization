SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry has expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing concerns over the potential consequences of such labeling. Spokesman Kong Quan emphasized that China believes anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not arbitrarily expanded. He stressed that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. This approach, according to Kong, is essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally. By taking a moral stance against the use of divisive language, China is promoting a more collaborative and respectful approach to international relations. By doing so, China is upholding the values of cooperation, equality, and respect for sovereignty, which are essential for building a more harmonious and peaceful world.
