SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry has expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing its potential to lead to serious consequences. According to spokesman Kong Quan, China has observed that the US public does not agree with the term, and stresses that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong emphasized that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. This approach is crucial for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally. By taking a stand against the divisive and provocative language, China is promoting a more collaborative and respectful approach to international relations.
