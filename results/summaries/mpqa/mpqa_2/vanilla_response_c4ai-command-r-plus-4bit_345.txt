SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. He stated that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on solid evidence and that expanding anti-terrorism attacks arbitrarily is not advisable. Kong emphasized that state-to-state relations should adhere to the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment for all countries. China has taken note that U.S. public opinion disagrees with the "axis of evil" wording, and following its logic could have serious consequences. China's stance promotes long-term peace and stability in the world and affected regions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
