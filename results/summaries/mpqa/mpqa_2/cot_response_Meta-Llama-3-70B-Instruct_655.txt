SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing that it can have serious consequences. He emphasized that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong stressed that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. He warned that using such language can lead to serious consequences and undermine long-term peace and stability in the world. China's stance is that handling international relations should be based on equality, respect, and evidence-based decision-making, rather than arbitrary and divisive labeling. END OF SUMMARY.
