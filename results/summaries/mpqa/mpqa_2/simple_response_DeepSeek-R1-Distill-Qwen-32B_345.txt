Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about China's disapproval of using the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of using such terms. He's responding to comments from U.S. leaders about North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Kong emphasizes that China doesn't support using labels like "axis of evil" because it could lead to serious consequences. He also points out that U.S. public opinion doesn't agree with this terminology.

Additionally, Kong talks about anti-terrorism efforts needing solid evidence and not expanding arbitrarily. He stresses the importance of following UN principles and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, which promote equality among nations. The summary should highlight China's stance against the term, the potential negative outcomes, their stance on terrorism, and their support for international cooperation based on equality.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects, like promoting peace and equality. I'll structure it to first state China's disapproval, then mention the consequences, their stance on anti-terrorism, and their support for international principles. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.
