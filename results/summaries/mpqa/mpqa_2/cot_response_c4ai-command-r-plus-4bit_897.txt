SUMMARY:
China has expressed its disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" to describe the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, and Iraq. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, stated that such morally charged language is inappropriate in international relations. He emphasized that China disapproves of the use of the word "evil" in this context and that the Chinese government has noticed that the U.S. public opinion and general public do not agree with this wording either. Kong further warned that following the logic of this terminology could have serious consequences. China advocates for a more ethical approach to international relations, emphasizing the importance of irrefutable evidence in anti-terrorism campaigns and upholding the principles of the United Nations Charter, peaceful coexistence, and equal treatment of all countries. This, Kong stressed, is the only moral course of action that will foster long-term peace and stability in the world.
