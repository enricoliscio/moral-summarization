SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" used to describe North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. He emphasized that such language is not conducive to international relations and can have serious consequences. Kong stressed that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. He reiterated that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. This approach is essential for safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. China's stance is rooted in a commitment to peaceful coexistence and equal treatment, rather than arbitrary and divisive labeling. END OF SUMMARY.
