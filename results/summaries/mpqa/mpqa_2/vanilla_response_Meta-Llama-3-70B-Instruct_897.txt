SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry has expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. Spokesman Kong Quan made the comment in response to a statement by a US leader describing North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations. Kong emphasized that China opposes the use of such language, citing that it may have serious consequences if taken to its logical conclusion. He also noted that US public opinion does not agree with the term.

China stresses that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. The country believes that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful co-existence, and equal treatment of all nations. This approach is crucial for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally.

Kong's remarks highlight China's concerns about the implications of using inflammatory language in international relations. By advocating for a more measured approach, China seeks to promote a more collaborative and peaceful global environment.
