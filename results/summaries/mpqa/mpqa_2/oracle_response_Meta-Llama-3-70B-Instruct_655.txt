SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the use of phrases like "axis of evil" in international relations, citing concerns over the serious consequences of such language. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan, the country believes that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong emphasized the importance of handling state-to-state relations in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment for all countries. This approach, he stressed, is the only way to safeguard long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. By following this path, China aims to promote peace and stability, rather than fueling tensions and conflicts. Kong's remarks highlight China's commitment to a more collaborative and respectful approach to international relations.
