Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article. The user has specified that the summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and should follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about China's disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, made this statement in response to U.S. leaders labeling North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as part of this axis.

I should note the key points: China's disapproval, the context of the U.S. leader's statement, the spokesman's comments on the potential serious consequences, the emphasis on anti-terrorism based on evidence, and the adherence to UN principles and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.

Next, I need to condense these points into a coherent summary. I'll start by stating China's position, then mention the context of the U.S. statement. I'll include Kong Quan's points about the consequences and the principles China supports.

I should ensure the summary is within 200 words and flows logically. I'll avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Finally, I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence covers a main point without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review it to ensure clarity and that all important aspects are included.
