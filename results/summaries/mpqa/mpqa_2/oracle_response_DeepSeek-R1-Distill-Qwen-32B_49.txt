Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified that I should include certain morally framed words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of using terms like "axis of evil" in international relations. He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with this wording and that following such logic could have serious consequences. He emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Also, he stresses the importance of following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace and stability.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I should start by stating China's disapproval of the term. Then mention the U.S. public's disagreement and the potential serious consequences. Next, highlight the points about anti-terrorism based on evidence and not expanding it. Finally, include the emphasis on following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace.

I'll make sure to include all the specified moral words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and end it properly. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.

He criticized the U.S. leader's description of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as part of such an axis, stating that expanding anti-terrorism efforts without evidence and arbitrarily is unacceptable. Kong emphasized that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and treat all countries equally. He warned that following the logic of labeling nations as "evil" could lead to serious consequences and stressed that safeguarding global peace and stability requires adherence to these principles. END OF SUMMARY.
