SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, specifically referring to a statement made by a U.S. leader describing North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. Kong emphasized that China believes anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on solid evidence and not arbitrarily expanded. He also highlighted the importance of adhering to the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment for all countries to maintain peace and stability globally and regionally. China has taken note of the disagreement within U.S. public opinion regarding the use of the term and believes that following the logic of the wording could lead to serious consequences.
