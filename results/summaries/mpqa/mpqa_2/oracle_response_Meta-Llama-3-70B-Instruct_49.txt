SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing its potential to lead to serious consequences. Kong emphasized that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily, stressing the importance of following the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. He highlighted that handling state-to-state relations should be done in a manner that safeguards long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. Kong also noted that the US public opinion and general public do not agree with the term "axis of evil", implying that it is essential to treat all countries on an equal footing.
