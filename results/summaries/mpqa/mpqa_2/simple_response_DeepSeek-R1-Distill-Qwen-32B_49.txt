Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about China disapproving of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, made this statement in response to U.S. leaders labeling North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with the term and that using it could have serious consequences. He also emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence and not expanded without reason. Plus, he stresses the importance of following UN principles and treating countries equally.

Hmm, the user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they need a concise summary that keeps the moral aspects intact. I should highlight China's disapproval of the term, the reasons given, and the emphasis on international law and equality. Also, the user wants the summary to be under 200 words and to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I need to make sure the summary includes Kong Quan's main points: disapproval of the term, the potential negative consequences, the need for evidence in anti-terrorism, and adherence to international principles. I should keep it clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions.

Let me structure it: start with China's stance, mention the specific countries labeled, Kong Quan's comments on the term's impact, the call for evidence-based action, and the emphasis on international law and equality. That should cover all the moral points without exceeding the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within 200 words and flows naturally.
