SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, specifically referring to a statement made by a U.S. leader describing North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. Kong emphasized that China believes anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on solid evidence and should not be arbitrarily expanded. He also highlighted the importance of adhering to the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment for all countries in handling state-to-state relations. China has noticed the disagreement within U.S. public opinion regarding the use of the term and warned of serious consequences if the logic of the wording is pursued. Kong's remarks emphasize China's stance on maintaining peace and stability in the world and related regions.
