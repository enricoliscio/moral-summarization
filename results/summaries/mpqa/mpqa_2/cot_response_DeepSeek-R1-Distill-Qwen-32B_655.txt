Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article mentions "axis of evil," which is clearly a negative term. Then, "disapproves" shows China's opposition. "International relations" is a neutral term but used in a moral context here. "Anti-terrorism campaigns" and "attacks" relate to moral issues of security and justice. "Irrefutable evidence" and "arbitrarily" emphasize the need for fairness and proper justification. "United Nations Charter," "Peaceful Co-existence," "equal footing," "peace and stability," and "long-term" all carry moral weight, highlighting principles of cooperation and justice.

Now, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these terms. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective presented. I'll start by stating China's disapproval of the term "axis of evil." Then, mention the context of the U.S. leader's statement and the media reactions. Highlight China's stance on evidence-based anti-terrorism and adherence to international principles. Conclude by emphasizing the importance of these principles for global stability.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. Let me check the word count to stay within the limit. Okay, that should cover it while preserving the moral framing.
