Okay, I need to summarize this news article about China's stance on the "axis of evil" term in international relations. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of using terms like "axis of evil" in international relations. He made this comment when asked about recent statements by U.S. leaders referring to North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. 

Kong Quan emphasized that China doesn't support using such language because it could lead to serious consequences. He also noted that even U.S. public opinion doesn't agree with this wording. 

He went on to say that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on solid evidence and shouldn't be expanded without reason. China advocates for international relations to follow the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equality among nations. This approach, according to Kong, is the best way to maintain global and regional peace and stability.

So, the main points are:
1. China disapproves of the term "axis of evil" in international relations.
2. They believe it could have serious consequences and isn't supported by U.S. public opinion.
3. China supports anti-terrorism based on evidence, not arbitrary expansion.
4. They advocate for international relations guided by the UN Charter, Five Principles, and equality.

I need to condense these points into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I should make sure to include the key elements: who (China's Foreign Ministry), what (disapproval of the term), why (potential consequences, U.S. public opinion), and their stance on international relations.

I'll structure it to first state China's disapproval, then mention the context of the U.S. leader's statement, followed by the reasons for their stance, and conclude with their principles for international relations.

Let me draft that and check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
