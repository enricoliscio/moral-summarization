SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing its potential to have serious consequences. He emphasized that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong stressed that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. This approach, he argued, is conducive to safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. China's stance is rooted in its commitment to promoting peace and stability, rather than fueling conflict and division. END OF SUMMARY.
