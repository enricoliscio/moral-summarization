Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about China's stance on the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, commented on this. He disapproves of using such terms because they can lead to serious consequences. He mentioned that even U.S. public opinion doesn't support it. 

He also talked about anti-terrorism efforts needing solid evidence and not expanding attacks without reason. Kong emphasized following the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and treating all countries equally. This approach is better for global peace and stability.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all key points. I'll start with China's disapproval, mention the发言人's comments, the impact of the term, the importance of evidence in anti-terrorism, and the principles they advocate for international relations.

Let me structure it step by step. First, state China's position. Then, Kong's comments on the term and its consequences. Next, the necessity of evidence in counter-terrorism. Finally, the principles they support for international relations and the benefits of that approach.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it and check the word count.
