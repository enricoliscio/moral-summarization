SUMMARY: China has expressed its disapproval of the use of morally charged language, such as the "axis of evil," in international relations. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, emphasized the potential serious consequences of employing such harmful wording. China stands firm in its belief that anti-terrorism efforts should be grounded in undeniable evidence and should not be arbitrarily expanded. Furthermore, Kong stressed the importance of upholding the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful coexistence, and equal treatment of all nations in handling state-to-state relations. China's position highlights its commitment to safeguarding long-term peace and stability worldwide and in specific regions. China's stance is supported by divergent views in U.S. public opinion and the general public, who also disagree with the use of "axis of evil" rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
