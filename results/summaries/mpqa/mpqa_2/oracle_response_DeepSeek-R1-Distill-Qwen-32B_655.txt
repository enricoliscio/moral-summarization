Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally framed words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman disapproves of using "axis of evil" in international relations. He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with the term and that using such language could lead to serious consequences. He emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. He also stresses following UN principles and treating all countries equally for peace and stability.

Now, I need to create a concise summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: China's disapproval, the impact of the term, the importance of evidence, not expanding anti-terrorism, following UN principles, treating countries equally, and safeguarding peace.

I'll structure it to highlight China's stance, the potential negative effects of the term, their emphasis on evidence and not expanding, and their commitment to international principles for peace.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to use the moral words where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.
