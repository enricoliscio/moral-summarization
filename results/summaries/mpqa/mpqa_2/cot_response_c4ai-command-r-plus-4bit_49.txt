SUMMARY:
China has disapproved of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan stating that such wording is detrimental to world peace and stability. China believes that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful co-existence, and equal treatment of all nations. The Chinese position disapproves of the "axis of evil" label, which has also been met with disagreement from US public opinion and the general public. Kong emphasized the serious consequences that could arise from following the logic of this terminology. China's stance upholds the belief that anti-terrorism efforts should not be arbitrarily expanded and that maintaining world peace requires respect for all nations, promoting long-term stability.
