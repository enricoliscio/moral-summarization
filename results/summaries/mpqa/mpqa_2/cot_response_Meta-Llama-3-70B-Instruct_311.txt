SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" used to describe the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, and Iraq. He emphasized that China notices that the US public opinion does not agree with this wording, which could have serious consequences if followed logically. Kong stressed that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. He also highlighted the importance of handling state-to-state relations according to the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among countries. This approach is conducive to safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. China's stance promotes a more equal and peaceful international relations framework.
