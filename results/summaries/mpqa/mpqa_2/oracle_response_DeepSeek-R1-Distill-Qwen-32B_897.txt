Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about China disapproving of the use of "axis of evil" in international relations. The user provided a list of morally framed words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of using terms like "axis of evil." He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with this wording, and the consequences could be serious. He also talks about anti-terrorism based on evidence, not expanding attacks, and following UN principles and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. The goal is to safeguard peace and stability.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating China's disapproval of the term. Then, mention Kong Quan's comments about U.S. public opinion and the potential serious consequences. Next, include his points about anti-terrorism needing evidence and not expanding arbitrarily. Finally, highlight the emphasis on international law principles to safeguard peace and stability.

I should make sure to include all the morally framed words: expanded, follow, treated, safeguarding, peace. Let me structure the sentences to incorporate these. For example, "expanded arbitrarily" fits when talking about anti-terrorism attacks. "Follow" can be used regarding the principles they should adhere to. "Treated" can relate to equal treatment of countries. "Safeguarding" and "peace" are already part of the conclusion.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely. Also, check that the moral framing words are naturally included without forcing them in.
