SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, specifically referencing a statement made by a U.S. leader describing North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. Kong emphasized that China opposes the arbitrary expansion of anti-terrorism campaigns without irrefutable evidence and advocates for respecting the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. He highlighted the potential serious consequences of such inflammatory language and reiterated China's commitment to long-term peace and stability in the world. China has noticed the disagreement within U.S. public opinion regarding the use of the term, and encourages a more thoughtful and evidence-based approach to international relations and anti-terrorism efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
