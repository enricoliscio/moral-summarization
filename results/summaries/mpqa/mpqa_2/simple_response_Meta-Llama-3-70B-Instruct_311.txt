SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the use of inflammatory language, such as the "axis of evil," in international relations. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan, this type of rhetoric can have serious consequences if taken to its logical conclusion. China emphasizes the importance of basing anti-terrorism efforts on irrefutable evidence and avoiding arbitrary expansions of military campaigns. Moreover, the country stresses that state-to-state relations should be guided by the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. This approach is seen as essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally and regionally. By advocating for a more measured and collaborative approach to international relations, China is promoting a moral framework that prioritizes cooperation, respect, and the avoidance of harmful rhetoric.
