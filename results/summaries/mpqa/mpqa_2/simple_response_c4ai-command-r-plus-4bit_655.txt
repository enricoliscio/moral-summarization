SUMMARY: China disapproves of the use of inflammatory language such as the "axis of evil" in international relations, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based approaches and respect for the sovereignty of nations.

Spokesman Kong Quan expressed China's disagreement with the labeling of certain nations as an "axis of evil," a term that has sparked debate and concern among the U.S. public and international community. Kong highlighted the potential severity of consequences if such labels are applied without regard for the principles of equality, peace, and justice that should govern international relations.

China advocates for a more cautious and respectful approach to counter-terrorism efforts, emphasizing the need for irrefutable evidence and caution against arbitrary expansion of anti-terrorism attacks. The nation upholds the importance of adhering to the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the treatment of all countries as equals in global affairs. This, Kong argues, is the path to safeguarding long-term peace and stability worldwide. China's stance reflects a commitment to diplomacy, respect for sovereignty, and a nuanced understanding of the complexities of international relations.
