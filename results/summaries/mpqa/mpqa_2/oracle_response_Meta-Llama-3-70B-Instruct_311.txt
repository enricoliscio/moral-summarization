SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, emphasizing that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan stressed that handling state-to-state relations should follow the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle that all countries should be treated on an equal footing. This approach is conducive to safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and related regions. Kong noted that the consequences of using such language would be serious if its logic is followed. China's stance is rooted in the importance of promoting peace and stability, rather than fueling tensions and conflicts.
