SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" being used in international relations. This came in response to a statement by a US leader that referred to North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations. Kong emphasized that China opposes the use of such language, citing that it can have serious consequences if taken to its logical conclusion. He also noted that US public opinion does not agree with the term. China advocates for anti-terrorism efforts to be based on solid evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong stressed that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. This approach is crucial for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally.
