SUMMARY: China has disapproved of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan stating that such wording could have serious consequences. China emphasizes the importance of basing anti-terrorism campaigns on irrefutable evidence and refraining from arbitrarily expanding anti-terrorism attacks. Kong asserted that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. This stance reflects China's commitment to safeguarding long-term peace and stability in the world and affected regions. By rejecting inflammatory language and advocating for evidence-based actions, China promotes a more measured and thoughtful approach to international relations and global peace.
