SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan. The term was recently used by the US to describe North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Kong stated that China opposes the use of such language, citing that it could have serious consequences if taken to its logical conclusion. He emphasized that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on solid evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. China advocates for handling state-to-state relations in accordance with the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. This approach, Kong believes, is essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally. China's stance is also influenced by the fact that US public opinion does not support the "axis of evil" terminology.
