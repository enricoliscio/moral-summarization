SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed strong disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. He emphasized that China disapproves of such morally charged language and pointed out that the consequences could be severe if the logic behind the wording is pursued. Kong stressed that China upholds the importance of irrefutable evidence in anti-terrorism campaigns and opposes the arbitrary expansion of anti-terrorism attacks. He highlighted the principles of equality, peaceful co-existence, and adherence to the UN Charter as essential frameworks for handling state-to-state relations. China believes that these principles are vital for maintaining long-term peace and stability in the world and affected regions. China's stance on this matter aligns with the views of U.S. public opinion and the general public, who also disagree with the use of such morally condemning language. END OF SUMMARY.
