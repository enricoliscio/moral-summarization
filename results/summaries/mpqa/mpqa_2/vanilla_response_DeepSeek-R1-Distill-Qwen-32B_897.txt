Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about China's response to the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, made a statement disapproving of this terminology. 

He was responding to comments from the New York Times and Washington Post regarding a U.S. leader's statement that labeled North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as part of the "axis of evil." Kong emphasized that such language isn't appropriate and could lead to serious consequences. He also mentioned that even U.S. public opinion doesn't fully support this wording.

Kong stressed that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on solid evidence and shouldn't be expanded without reason. He also pointed out that international relations should follow the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and treat all countries equally. This approach, he said, is the best way to ensure long-term peace and stability.

So, the key points are: China disapproves of the term "axis of evil," Kong's comments about the potential negative consequences, the importance of evidence in anti-terrorism, and adherence to international principles for peaceful relations.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include all these points clearly and concisely.
