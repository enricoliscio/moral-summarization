SUMMARY:

China's Foreign Ministry has expressed disapproval of the term "axis of evil" being used in international relations, citing concerns over the serious consequences that may arise from such labeling. Spokesman Kong Quan emphasized that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not arbitrarily expanded. He also stressed the importance of adhering to the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and treating all countries as equals. This approach, according to Kong, is crucial for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally. The Chinese government's stance is rooted in its commitment to promoting peaceful and respectful state-to-state relations.

By condemning the use of divisive language, China is upholding a moral imperative to prioritize diplomacy and cooperation over confrontation and hostility. This stance serves as a reminder that responsible international relations should be guided by principles of mutual respect, equality, and a commitment to peaceful resolution of conflicts.
