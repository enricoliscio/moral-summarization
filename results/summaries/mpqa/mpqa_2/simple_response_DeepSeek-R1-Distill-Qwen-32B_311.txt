Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about China's stance on the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, disapproves of this terminology. He mentions that the U.S. public doesn't agree with it either. He emphasizes that anti-terrorism should be based on evidence and shouldn't be expanded without reason. He also stresses the importance of following UN principles and treating all countries equally.

I should focus on the key points: China's disapproval, the context of the U.S. statement, the emphasis on evidence-based anti-terrorism, and adherence to international principles. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it captures the moral aspects like promoting peace and stability.

Let me structure this: start with China's disapproval, mention the U.S. context, Kong's points about evidence and expansion, and conclude with the importance of international principles for peace. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

SUMMARY:  
China has expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, as stated by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan. He criticized the U.S. leader's recent description of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as part of an "axis of evil," emphasizing that such language risks serious consequences if acted upon. Kong noted that even U.S. public opinion opposes this terminology. He stressed that anti-terrorism efforts should be grounded in undeniable evidence and should not be arbitrarily expanded, advocating instead for international relations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equality among nations. Kong argued that these principles are essential for maintaining global and regional peace and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
