SUMMARY: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, specifically referring to a statement made by a U.S. leader describing North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as such. Kong emphasized that China opposes the arbitrary expansion of anti-terrorism campaigns without irrefutable evidence and advocates for handling state-to-state relations based on the principles of the UN Charter, peaceful co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. He warned that following the logic of the "axis of evil" wording could have serious consequences and is detrimental to long-term peace and stability in the world. China's stance highlights its commitment to a moral framework in international relations that prioritizes evidence-based actions, equality, and peace.

END OF SUMMARY.
