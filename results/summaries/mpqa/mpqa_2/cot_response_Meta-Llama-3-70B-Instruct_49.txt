SUMMARY:
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, expressed disapproval of the use of the term "axis of evil" in international relations, citing that it can have serious consequences if taken to its logical conclusion. Kong emphasized that anti-terrorism efforts should be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. He stressed that state-to-state relations should adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle of equal treatment among nations. This approach is essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability in the world. Kong's comments came in response to a statement by a U.S. leader describing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations. China has noted that U.S. public opinion does not agree with this wording, highlighting the importance of a more nuanced and principled approach to international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
