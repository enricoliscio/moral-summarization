SUMMARY:

China has expressed disapproval of the use of phrases like "axis of evil" in international relations. This was stated by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan in response to a US leader's description of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as "axis of evil" nations. Kong emphasized that China opposes the use of such language, citing that it can have serious consequences. He also noted that US public opinion does not agree with the term. China advocates for anti-terrorism efforts to be based on irrefutable evidence and not expanded arbitrarily. Kong stressed that state-to-state relations should follow the principles of the UN Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and equal treatment of all countries. This approach is essential for maintaining long-term peace and stability globally.
