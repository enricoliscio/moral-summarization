SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has announced its stance on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The government appreciates the US's efforts to address climate change and notes that the new initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach. However, the Korean government believes that the initiative needs further elaboration, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The government also emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes as over 180 countries, including the US, prepare to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which requires signatories to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The US had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, but has recently announced a new policy aiming to reduce emissions relative to economic activities.
