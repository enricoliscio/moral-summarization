SUMMARY: The South Korean government has released a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, expressing appreciation for the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach adopted by the U.S. initiative and its consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, the Korean government also highlights the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement emphasizes the importance of consultations among the international community to build understanding regarding the U.S. initiative and affirms South Korea's active participation in this process. The article also mentions the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and notes that over 180 countries, including the United States, have prepared for its ratification.
