SUMMARY: The Republic of Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and its efforts to present a new initiative to tackle this global challenge. The country's foreign minister, Choi Sung-hong, released a statement acknowledging the flexible and gradual approach adopted by the US initiative, considering the concerns of developing countries. However, the statement also emphasizes the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Republic of Korea believes that consultations among the international community are necessary to build a mutual understanding of the US initiative and ensures its active participation in this process. This moral stance contrasts with the criticism the US faced for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol before the September 11 terrorist attacks and the different tones taken by other countries like Japan and Germany in response to the new US climate change policy.
