Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the South Korean government's response to the U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions. 

First, the article mentions that the government appreciates the U.S.'s continued interest in climate change and their new initiative. They acknowledge the flexible and gradual approach and that it considers developing countries' concerns. 

But they also point out that more details are needed for the initiative to be discussed internationally. The article notes that many countries, including the U.S., have prepared to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, but Bush rejected it and introduced a new policy focusing on emissions relative to GDP. 

South Korea's statement says they'll participate actively in international discussions about this new policy. Other countries like Japan and Germany have also commented on Bush's policy, but with different tones. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the appreciation of the U.S. initiative, the need for more details, the context of the Kyoto Protocol, Bush's rejection, and the U.S.'s new policy. Also, mention South Korea's active participation and the differing responses from other countries.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the announcement, appreciation, mention the gradual approach, the need for elaboration, the Kyoto Protocol context, Bush's policy, and the international reactions. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

However, they emphasize the need for further details, such as concrete methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The statement comes amid international preparations for the Kyoto Protocol's ratification, which the U.S. rejected under President Bush, opting instead for a new policy targeting emissions relative to GDP. South Korea will actively engage in international discussions on the U.S. initiative, while other countries like Japan and Germany have also commented, albeit with differing tones. END OF SUMMARY.
