SUMMARY:
The Republic of Korea has shown appreciation for the United States' continued interest and efforts in addressing climate change, specifically mentioning the new initiative presented by President George W. Bush on February 14. The Korean government believes that the initiative, which adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, takes into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, they also view that more detail is needed for future discussions, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Korean government emphasizes the importance of consultations among the international community to build understanding regarding the U.S. initiative and pledges active participation in this process. Over 180 countries, including the United States, have been preparing for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework rejected by the Bush administration early last year. The administration faced severe blame from the international community for rejecting the protocol prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Countries such as Japan and Germany have issued statements on Bush's new climate change policy, reflecting varying perspectives on the matter.
