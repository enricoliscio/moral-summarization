SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, acknowledging the importance of addressing climate change. While appreciating the US initiative, the Korean government notes that the plan lacks concrete methods for establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels and requires further elaboration. The government emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative, particularly in light of the ongoing preparations for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, aims to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the US policy focuses on reducing emissions relative to economic activities. The Korean government's stance is seen as more conciliatory compared to other countries, such as Japan and Germany, which have responded to the US policy with more critical tones. The government's approach highlights the importance of international cooperation in addressing climate change.
