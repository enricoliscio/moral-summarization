SUMMARY: The South Korean government has responded to U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions with appreciation and a call for further discussion. In a statement issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, South Korea acknowledged the flexible and gradual approach proposed by the U.S., which takes into account the concerns of developing countries. However, the country also emphasized the need for greater elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. This comes as parties to the Climate Change Convention work towards the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty adopted in 1997 to control greenhouse gas emissions. While the U.S. administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol last year, facing severe blame from the international community, the recent announcement of a new policy on climate change aims to reduce emissions relative to economic activities. The South Korean government believes that consultations among the international community are necessary to build understanding and has pledged to actively participate in this process. Other countries, including Japan and Germany, have also issued statements on Bush's new policy, with varying tones. The challenge of climate change presents a significant moral imperative for the international community to approach collaboratively, and South Korea is taking a proactive and constructive stance in this ongoing discussion.
END OF SUMMARY.
