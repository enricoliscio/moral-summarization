Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the South Korean government's response to the US's new greenhouse gas policy. They appreciate the US's interest in climate change and their new initiative. The US wants to discuss this along with the Kyoto Protocol. 

The South Korean statement mentions that the US approach is flexible and considers developing countries. They think more details are needed for future discussions. The article also notes that over 180 countries, including the US, are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, but the Bush administration rejected it last year. Some countries like Japan and Germany have already commented on the US policy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the South Korean government's appreciation of the US initiative. Then, note their support for the flexible approach and the need for more details. Also, include that the US rejected Kyoto but many countries are still on board. Finally, mention other countries' reactions. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points.
