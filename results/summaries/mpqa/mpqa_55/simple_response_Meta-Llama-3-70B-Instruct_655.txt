SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on climate change, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activity. While appreciating the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, the Korean government notes that the new initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, and that international consultations are necessary to build understanding on the US initiative. The Korean government will actively participate in this process, emphasizing the importance of cooperation among the international community. The government's stance is seen as a moral imperative, recognizing climate change as one of the greatest challenges humanity faces in the 21st century.
