SUMMARY:
The South Korean government has announced its stance on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in climate change and efforts to address this critical issue. The Korean government notes that the new initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Seoul government will actively participate in international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes after the US administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which has been severely blamed by the international community. The Korean government's stance is in contrast to other countries, such as Japan and Germany, which have issued statements on Bush's new policy in different tones. END OF SUMMARY.
