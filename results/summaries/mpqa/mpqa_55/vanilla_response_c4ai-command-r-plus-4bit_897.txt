SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which proposes an alternative approach to the Kyoto Protocol. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the U.S.'s efforts in addressing climate change and highlights the flexible and gradual nature of the new initiative, which takes into account the concerns of developing countries. However, the Korean government also emphasizes the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement suggests that consultations among the international community are necessary to build understanding and that the Seoul government will actively participate in these discussions. This comes as over 180 countries, including the U.S., have been preparing for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. administration's previous rejection of the Protocol and recent announcement of a new policy have sparked varying responses from other countries, with Japan and Germany issuing statements in rather different tones.
