Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to understand the task. They want me to identify morally framed words in the article. That means I should look for words that carry positive or negative connotations related to ethics or values. Words like "appreciates," "efforts," "challenges," "flexible," "concrete," "understanding," "reject," "blamed," "severe," "different tones." I'll list each of these with a star.

Next, I have to summarize the article, preserving as many of these moral words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the Korean government's stance on the U.S. initiative, their appreciation for the effort, the need for elaboration, and the comparison with the Kyoto Protocol. Also, mention other countries' reactions and the Bush administration's previous rejection.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the announcement, then the appreciation, the need for more details, the international context, and finally the reactions from other countries. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit.

I also need to format the response correctly, starting with STEP 1, listing each word, then the SUMMARY section, and ending with the tokens as specified. 

I think I've covered all the points. Let me put it all together now.

**STEP 1:**  
* appreciates  
* efforts  
* challenges  
* flexible  
* gradual  
* concerns  
* elaboration  
* concrete  
* understanding  
* reject  
* blamed  
* severe  
* different tones  

**SUMMARY:**  
The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative to address climate change, acknowledging its flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the government emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on establishing concrete levels of greenhouse gas intensity. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, noted that the initiative should be discussed in future international forums to build understanding. The government also highlighted the importance of international consultations, especially in light of the ongoing ratification process of the Kyoto Protocol, which over 180 countries, including the U.S., have prepared for. The U.S. administration, under President George W. Bush, had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol but introduced a new policy focusing on reducing emissions relative to GDP. Some countries, like Japan and Germany, have already responded to Bush's initiative with differing tones, reflecting the complex international dynamics surrounding climate change efforts.
