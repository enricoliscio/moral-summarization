Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the South Korean government's response to the US's new climate policy. The original text is a bit lengthy, so I'll need to condense it.

First, I should identify the key points. The US under Bush introduced a new greenhouse gas policy. South Korea appreciates the US's efforts but wants more details. They also mention the Kyoto Protocol and other countries' stances.

I need to keep the moral tone, which seems positive towards the US's initiative but critical of its lack of specifics. Also, highlight South Korea's support for international dialogue.

I'll structure the summary to include the US's new policy, South Korea's appreciation, the need for elaboration, and their commitment to international discussions. I'll make sure to mention the Kyoto Protocol and the US's previous rejection of it.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all essential elements. Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging its flexible approach and consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, they emphasize the need for greater elaboration, particularly regarding methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. South Korea supports international dialogue to build understanding of the U.S. policy and will actively participate in future discussions. This stance contrasts with the U.S.'s previous rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, which many countries, including South Korea, are preparing to ratify. The government highlights the importance of addressing climate change as a critical 21st-century challenge, while also recognizing the need for a collaborative international effort to evaluate and integrate the U.S. initiative into global efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
