SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the U.S.'s continued interest in addressing climate change and highlights the initiative's flexible and gradual approach, as well as its consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, the Korean government also believes that further elaboration is needed on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding on the U.S. initiative and pledges Korea's active participation in this process. This comes as over 180 countries prepare for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with the exception of the U.S., which rejected the protocol last year. Other countries, including Japan and Germany, have also issued statements on Bush's new climate policy, with varying tones. END OF SUMMARY.
