Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Korean government's stance on the U.S. climate policy. The article mentions that the U.S. President Bush has a new policy on controlling greenhouse gases, which he wants to discuss internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs appreciates the U.S.'s interest in climate change and their new initiative. They acknowledge the flexible approach and consideration for developing countries in the U.S. plan.

The summary should highlight that the Korean government supports the U.S. initiative but thinks more details are needed for international discussions. They also mention that over 180 countries, including the U.S., are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration rejected. Other countries like Japan and Germany have also commented on the U.S. policy differently.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include the key points: appreciation for the U.S. initiative, the need for more elaboration, the context of the Kyoto Protocol, and the international reactions.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging its flexible approach and consideration for developing countries. However, they emphasize the need for further elaboration, particularly on establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels, for meaningful international discussions. The government supports the Kyoto Protocol, which over 180 countries, including the U.S., are preparing to ratify, despite the Bush administration's rejection of the Protocol. Other nations, such as Japan and Germany, have also commented on the U.S. policy with varying tones. END OF SUMMARY.
