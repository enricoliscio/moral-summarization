Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the South Korean government's response to the US's new greenhouse gas policy. They appreciate the US's interest and efforts, noting it's a flexible approach and considers developing countries. But they also say more details are needed for international discussion. The US rejected the Kyoto Protocol before, but now has a new plan. Other countries like Japan and Germany have different reactions.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The article mentions the US's rejection of Kyoto and the appreciation for their new initiative. Also, the mention of the 180 countries preparing to ratify Kyoto shows the global consensus. The US's shift after 9/11 is a point too, as it changed their stance.

I should make sure the summary includes these points: appreciation, the need for more details, the US's previous rejection, the new policy, and the international community's preparation. Also, note that other countries have different tones.

I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me start drafting:

South Korea appreciates the US's new climate policy but wants more details. They acknowledge it's a flexible approach and considers developing nations. However, they need specifics on emission levels. The US rejected Kyoto before but now has this new plan. Many countries, including the US, are ready to ratify Kyoto. The international community needs to discuss the US initiative. Other countries like Japan and Germany have different reactions.

Wait, that's a bit choppy. Let me make it flow better and include the moral framing about the US's shift and international consensus.

Hmm, maybe start with the appreciation, then the need for details, mention the US's previous rejection, their new policy, and the global context. Also, note that other countries have different tones, showing varying moral stances.

Let me try again:

The South Korean government appreciates the US's new climate policy, seeing it as a positive step, but calls for more details. They acknowledge the flexible approach and consideration for developing countries. However, they need concrete methods on emission levels. The US had rejected the Kyoto Protocol before but now has this new initiative. Over 180 countries, including the US, are preparing to ratify Kyoto, highlighting the global consensus. The international community needs to discuss the US's plan, and other countries like Japan and Germany have different reactions, showing varied approaches to addressing climate change.

That's better. It captures the appreciation, the need for details, the US's past rejection, their new policy, the global context, and the differing international reactions, which all contribute to the moral framing of the situation.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging its flexible approach and consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, it emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels, for meaningful international discussions. The government also stressed the importance of global consultations to build understanding of the U.S. policy. This comes as over 180 countries, including the U.S., prepare to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a framework for reducing emissions. The U.S. had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol but introduced a new policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities. The international community's differing reactions, including from Japan and Germany, highlight the ongoing debate over climate change strategies. END OF SUMMARY.
