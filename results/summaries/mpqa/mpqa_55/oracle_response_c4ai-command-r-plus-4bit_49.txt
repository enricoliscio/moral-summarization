SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which he proposed as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the U.S.'s continued interest in addressing climate change and recognizes that the new initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account the concerns of developing nations. However, the Korean government also believes that more detail is needed, specifically regarding the methods for establishing levels of greenhouse gas intensity, before the initiative can be fully discussed on the international stage. The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the Bush administration before the September 11 terrorist attacks had drawn severe criticism from the international community. Now, the Seoul government emphasizes the need for consultations to build understanding regarding the new U.S. initiative and pledges its active participation in this process.
