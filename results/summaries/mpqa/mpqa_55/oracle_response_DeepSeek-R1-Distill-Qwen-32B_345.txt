Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include: challenges, approach, attacks, and rejecting. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the South Korean government's response to the U.S. President's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions. They appreciate the U.S.'s interest and efforts but want more details. The article mentions the Kyoto Protocol, which the U.S. rejected, and the new policy aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP. Also, the U.S. was criticized before 9/11 for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the words 'challenges', 'approach', 'attacks', and'rejecting'. I'll structure the summary to highlight the South Korean government's appreciation, the need for elaboration, the U.S.'s rejection of Kyoto, and the context of the 9/11 attacks.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. I'll start by mentioning the government's appreciation, then the approach and need for details. Next, I'll note the rejection of Kyoto and the international criticism before 9/11. Finally, I'll add that South Korea will participate actively in discussions.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary points without being too lengthy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each morally framed word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY:  
The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. government's renewed interest in addressing climate change through President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. While acknowledging the initiative's "flexible and gradual approach," Seoul emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on establishing concrete levels of greenhouse gas intensity. The government also noted the importance of considering the concerns of developing countries. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, stressed the need for international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. initiative.  

The U.S. administration had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which over 180 countries, including South Korea, were preparing to ratify. The Bush administration's rejection drew criticism from the international community, particularly before the September 11 attacks. The new policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to GDP, but some countries, like Japan and Germany, have responded with differing tones. South Korea reiterated its commitment to actively participate in future international discussions on climate change.  
END OF SUMMARY.
