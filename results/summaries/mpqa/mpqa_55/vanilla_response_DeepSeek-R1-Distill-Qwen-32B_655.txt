Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Korean government's response to the U.S. climate policy. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that the U.S. President, George W. Bush, has a new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which he wants to discuss internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued a statement appreciating the U.S.'s interest in climate change and their new initiative. They note that the U.S. approach is flexible and gradual, considering developing countries' concerns.

The statement also says that the Korean government believes the U.S. initiative needs more elaboration, especially on how to set greenhouse gas intensity levels. They want this discussed in future international forums. The article also mentions that many countries, including the U.S., are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, but the Bush administration rejected it earlier and introduced a new policy focusing on reducing emissions relative to GDP.

Additionally, some countries like Japan and Germany have already commented on Bush's policy with different tones. The article provides background on the Kyoto Protocol and the U.S.'s stance before and after their rejection.

So, the key points are:
1. U.S. introduces a new climate policy.
2. Korea appreciates the initiative but wants more details.
3. Korea supports international discussion on the U.S. policy.
4. Many countries are preparing to ratify Kyoto, but the U.S. rejected it.
5. Other countries have different reactions to the U.S. policy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these points concisely. I'll start by mentioning the U.S. policy and Korea's appreciation, then the need for elaboration, the international context with the Kyoto Protocol, and the differing reactions from other countries.

SUMMARY: The U.S. government has introduced a new climate policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which it wants to discuss internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The Korean government has expressed appreciation for this initiative, noting its flexible and gradual approach and consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, they emphasize the need for further elaboration, particularly on establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels, for detailed discussions in future international forums. Over 180 countries, including the U.S., are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration rejected last year. The U.S. policy now aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP. Meanwhile, countries like Japan and Germany have reacted differently to the U.S. initiative. END OF SUMMARY.
