SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to economic activity. While appreciating the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, the Korean government notes that the new initiative takes a flexible and gradual approach, considering the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that further elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Korean government also emphasizes the importance of international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative, particularly in light of the ongoing efforts to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which has been adopted by over 180 countries.

The moral framing of the article suggests that the US's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year was a mistake, and that the international community has been critical of the US's stance on climate change. The Korean government's response is presented as a more cooperative and responsible approach, highlighting the need for international cooperation and understanding in addressing this critical global issue.
