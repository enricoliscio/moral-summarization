SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP or economic activities. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in climate change and acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach of the new initiative. However, the government believes that further elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be discussed in international fora. The government also emphasizes the need for consultations among the international community to build understanding on the US initiative. Meanwhile, over 180 countries, including the US, have prepared for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires signatories to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, have also issued statements on Bush's new policy.
