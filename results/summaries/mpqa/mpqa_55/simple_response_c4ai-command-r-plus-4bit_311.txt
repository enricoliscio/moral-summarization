SUMMARY: The South Korean government has released a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, showing appreciation for the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach of the new initiative and its consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, it also points out the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Seoul government emphasizes the importance of international consultations to build understanding about the U.S. initiative and pledges to actively participate in this process. This moral stance contrasts with the criticism the Bush administration faced from the international community for initially rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, a framework committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and aligns with the responses of other countries like Japan and Germany to Bush's new climate change policy.
