SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to Gross Domestic Product. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, one of the greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century. The Korean government notes that the new initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing emissions, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be discussed in international fora. The government also emphasizes the need for consultations amongst the international community to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes after the US administration led by President Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a framework that requires signatories to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was severely blamed by the international community.
