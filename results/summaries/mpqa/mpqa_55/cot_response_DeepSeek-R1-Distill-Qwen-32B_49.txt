Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user provided a news article about the South Korean government's response to the US's new climate policy. They want me to identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary that includes those terms.

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "appreciates," "interest," "efforts," "challenges," "flexible," "gradual," "concerns," "elaboration," "levels," "ratification," "reject," "blamed," and "statements" stand out. These terms imply approval, concern, or criticism, which are moral judgments.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these words. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the South Korean government's stance, their appreciation for the US's initiative, the need for more details, and the context of the Kyoto Protocol and other countries' reactions.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the South Korean government's appreciation for the US's efforts, then note their support for the initiative's approach, the need for elaboration, and their commitment to international discussions. I'll also include that many countries are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, despite the US's previous rejection and the criticism they faced.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the appreciation, moving to the evaluation of the initiative, the need for more details, and ending with the international context and Seoul's involvement.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all key points are included without unnecessary details.

**SUMMARY:**  
The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. government's renewed interest in addressing climate change through its new initiative to control greenhouse gas emissions. While acknowledging the initiative's flexible and gradual approach and its consideration of developing countries' concerns, Seoul emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on establishing concrete levels of greenhouse gas intensity. The government also stressed the importance of international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. proposal. Over 180 countries, including the U.S., are preparing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which requires signatories to reduce emissions. However, the Bush administration had previously rejected the Protocol, drawing criticism from the international community. Seoul plans to actively participate in future discussions on the U.S. initiative, while other countries like Japan and Germany have already issued statements with differing tones.
