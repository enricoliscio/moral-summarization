Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: challenges, approach, attacks, rejecting. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the South Korean government's response to the U.S. President George W. Bush's new greenhouse gas policy. They appreciate the U.S.'s initiative but want more details. It also mentions the Kyoto Protocol and the U.S.'s rejection of it, which led to international criticism.

I should include the morally framed words where they fit naturally. For example, "challenges" when talking about climate change, "approach" when describing the U.S. initiative, "attacks" referring to the 9/11 attacks, and "rejecting" the Kyoto Protocol.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the government's appreciation of the U.S. initiative, mention the flexible approach, and note the need for elaboration. Then, I'll touch on the international context, the U.S. rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, and the criticism they faced before 9/11. Finally, I'll mention other countries' differing responses.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key points without being too detailed. Let me piece it together, making sure to incorporate the moral framing words where appropriate.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging its "flexible and gradual approach" to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while considering developing nations' concerns. However, it emphasized the need for "greater elaboration," particularly on establishing emission levels. The government supports international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. plan, while also recognizing the ongoing efforts to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration "rejected" last year. The article highlights the "challenges" posed by climate change and notes that the U.S. faced international criticism for its stance before the September 11 attacks. Other countries, like Japan and Germany, have responded differently to the U.S. policy. END OF SUMMARY.
