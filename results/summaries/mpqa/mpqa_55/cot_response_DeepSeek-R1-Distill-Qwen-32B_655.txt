Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the task. The user provided a news article and wants a summary that includes morally framed words. They also want me to list those words first.

I'll start by reading the article carefully. It's about the South Korean government's response to the U.S. President's new climate policy. The key points are that the U.S. has a new initiative, the Korean government appreciates the effort, but wants more details. They also mention the Kyoto Protocol and other countries' reactions.

Now, for the moral framing. I need to identify words that carry moral connotations. Words like "appreciates," "efforts," "challenges," "flexible," "gradual," "concrete," "understanding," "active participation," "rejected," "blamed," "different tones." These words imply approval, concern, or criticism.

Next, I'll list these words as per the user's instruction. Then, I'll write a concise summary. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to keep the original tone. I'll mention the appreciation, the need for elaboration, and the international context, including the U.S. rejection and others' reactions.

I should keep the summary under 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the government's appreciation, then their concerns, mention the international efforts with Kyoto, and note other countries' differing responses. This should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral elements.

**STEP 1:**  
* appreciates  
* efforts  
* challenges  
* flexible  
* gradual  
* concrete  
* understanding  
* active participation  
* rejected  
* blamed  
* different tones  

**SUMMARY:**  
The South Korean government expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative to address climate change, acknowledging its flexible and gradual approach and consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, it emphasized the need for greater elaboration, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, for the initiative to be effectively discussed internationally. The government also highlighted the importance of international consultations to build understanding and stressed its commitment to actively participating in the process. Meanwhile, the U.S. had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, drawing criticism from the international community. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, had issued statements on Bush's new policy with different tones.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
