Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the Korean government's response to the U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions. They appreciate the U.S.'s initiative but think more details are needed. The U.S. rejected the Kyoto Protocol before, and now they have a new approach. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: appreciation, the flexible approach, need for elaboration, international community's role, and the context of the Kyoto Protocol and other countries' reactions. I'll structure it to highlight Korea's stance and the broader implications. Let me make sure to capture all the essential elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging its flexible approach and consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, it emphasized the need for further elaboration, particularly on methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be effectively discussed internationally. The government also stressed the importance of international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. proposal. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Protocol, which the U.S. rejected, has been ratified by over 180 countries, including South Korea, and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has proposed a new policy focusing on reducing emissions relative to GDP, a shift from its previous stance. END OF SUMMARY.
