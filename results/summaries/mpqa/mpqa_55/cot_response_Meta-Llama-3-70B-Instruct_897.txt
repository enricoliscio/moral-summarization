SUMMARY:
The Korean government has announced its position on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which is to be discussed internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The government "appreciates" the US's continued interest in climate change and "efforts" to address the issue. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative takes a "flexible and gradual" approach, considering the "concerns" of developing countries. However, the government believes that the initiative requires "greater elaboration" and "consultations" amongst the international community to build understanding. The Korean government will "actively participate" in this process. The US administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year was "severely blamed" by the international community, but the new policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities.
