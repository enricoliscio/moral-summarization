SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has announced its position on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in climate change and its efforts to address the issue. However, the Korean government believes that the new US initiative needs further elaboration, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before it can be discussed in international forums. The government also emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes as over 180 countries, including the US, prepare to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which requires gradual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The US had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, but has now announced a new policy aiming to reduce emissions relative to economic activity. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, have also issued statements on the new policy.
