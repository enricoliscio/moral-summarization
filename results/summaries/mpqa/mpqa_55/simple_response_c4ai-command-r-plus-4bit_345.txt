SUMMARY: South Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and their recent proposal of a new initiative to tackle this global challenge. The Korean government acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach adopted by the US initiative, as well as its consideration for developing nations. However, Korea also believes that further elaboration is required before the initiative can be fully discussed on the international stage, including clear methods for establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels. As the international community prepares for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty committing countries to reducing greenhouse emissions, the Seoul government underscores the necessity of consultations to foster understanding of the US initiative and vows to actively participate in this process. It is important to note that while the Bush administration previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, drawing criticism from the international community, they have now proposed a new policy aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, have offered varied responses to this new policy. END OF SUMMARY.
