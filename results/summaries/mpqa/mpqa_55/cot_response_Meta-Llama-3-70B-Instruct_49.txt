SUMMARY:
The Korean government has announced its stance on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The government "appreciates" the US's continued interest in addressing climate change and "efforts" to present a new initiative. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative adopts a "flexible" and "gradual" approach, taking into consideration the "concerns" of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Korean government will "actively" participate in international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes after the US administration was "severely blamed" by the international community for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
