SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, acknowledging the "continued interest" and "efforts" of the US government in addressing the "greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century". The Korean government appreciates the "flexible and gradual approach" of the new initiative, which takes into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that the US initiative requires "greater elaboration" and "concrete methods" to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The government also emphasizes the need for "consultations amongst the international community" to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes after the US administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, which was met with international criticism, particularly before the "Sept. 11 terrorist attacks". The Korean government will actively participate in the consultation process.
