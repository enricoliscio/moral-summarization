SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has announced its stance on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which he wants to discuss internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, one of the greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish the levels of greenhouse gas intensity, before the initiative can be discussed in more detail in international fora. The government also emphasizes the need for consultations amongst the international community to build understanding on the US initiative, which has been met with criticism from some countries, including Japan and Germany, who have issued statements in rather different tones. The US's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year was severely blamed by the international community, and its new policy is seen as a response to these attacks.
