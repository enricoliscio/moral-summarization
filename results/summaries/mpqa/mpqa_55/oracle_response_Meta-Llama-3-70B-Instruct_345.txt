SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has announced its stance on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to Gross Domestic Product or economic activities. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, one of the greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing emissions, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be discussed in international fora. The government also emphasizes the need for consultations amongst the international community to build understanding on the US initiative, which has been met with criticism from some countries. The US administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year was severely blamed by the international community, and its new policy has been met with differing reactions from countries like Japan and Germany.
