SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on climate change, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities. While appreciating the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, the Korean government notes that the new initiative takes a flexible and gradual approach, considering the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that the initiative requires further elaboration, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before it can be discussed in international fora. The Korean government emphasizes the need for consultations amongst the international community to build understanding on the US initiative and will actively participate in this process. This stance is seen as a morally responsible approach, as it prioritizes cooperation and consideration for developing countries in addressing the global challenge of climate change.
