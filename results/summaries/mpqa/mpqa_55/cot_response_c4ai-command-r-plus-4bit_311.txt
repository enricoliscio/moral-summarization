SUMMARY:
The Republic of Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and their recent initiative to tackle this pressing issue. The Korean government recognizes the flexible and considerate approach adopted by the U.S., which takes into account the concerns of developing countries. However, they also believe that further elaboration is needed for the initiative to be effectively discussed on international platforms, including the establishment of concrete methods for greenhouse gas intensity levels. As the international community prepares for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Korean government emphasizes the importance of consultations to build a mutual understanding of the U.S. initiative. They pledge active participation in this process. The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the Bush administration had previously drawn criticism, and now countries like Japan and Germany have issued statements on the new policy with varying tones.
