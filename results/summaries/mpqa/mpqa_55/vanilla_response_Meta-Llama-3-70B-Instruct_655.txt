SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to economic activity. The Korean government appreciates the US's continued interest in addressing climate change and notes that the new initiative takes a flexible and gradual approach, considering the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that further elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be discussed in international forums. The Korean government will actively participate in consultations with the international community to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes as over 180 countries, including the US, prepare to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which the US rejected last year.

END OF SUMMARY.
