SUMMARY:
The Republic of Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and their recent initiative to tackle this critical issue. The Korean government recognizes the flexible and considerate approach of the US initiative, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activities. However, the government also believes that further elaboration is needed for the initiative to be effectively discussed in future international forums, including clear methods for establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels. In light of the ongoing preparations for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a global framework for reducing emissions, the Korean government emphasizes the importance of international consultations to build understanding around the US initiative. The government pledges active participation in this process, recognizing the significance of global cooperation in addressing the challenges posed by climate change.
