SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to economic activities. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach of the U.S. initiative and its consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, South Korea believes that more detail is needed, including concrete methods for establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels, before the initiative can be fully discussed in international forums. The country also emphasizes the importance of consultations among the international community to build understanding and ensure a successful ratification process for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries, like Japan and Germany, have also responded to Bush's new policy, albeit with different tones.
