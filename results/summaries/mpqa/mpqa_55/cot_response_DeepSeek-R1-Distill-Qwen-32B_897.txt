Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided an article about the South Korean government's response to the US's new climate policy. They want me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are that the US has a new policy on greenhouse gases, the South Korean government appreciates this but wants more details. They also mention the Kyoto Protocol, which the US rejected earlier. Other countries like Japan and Germany have different reactions.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "appreciates," "efforts," "challenges," "flexible," "concerns," "elaboration," "understanding," "rejected," "blamed," "different tones." These words imply approval, concern, criticism, or judgment.

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of those moral words as possible. I'll start by stating the government's appreciation of the US's initiative. Then mention the flexible approach and consideration for developing countries. Highlight the need for elaboration and international consultation. Note the US's rejection of Kyoto and the international community's reaction. Conclude with South Korea's commitment to active participation.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main points while maintaining the moral framing. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Looks good, so I'll finalize the summary.

**STEP 1:**  
* appreciates  
* efforts  
* challenges  
* flexible  
* concerns  
* elaboration  
* understanding  
* rejected  
* blamed  
* different tones  

**SUMMARY:**  
The South Korean government expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative to address climate change, noting its flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while considering developing countries' concerns. However, it emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on establishing concrete levels of greenhouse gas intensity. The government also stressed the importance of international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. initiative. Meanwhile, the U.S. had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, drawing criticism from the international community. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, had reacted to the U.S. policy in different tones. South Korea reaffirmed its commitment to actively participate in future discussions on climate change.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
