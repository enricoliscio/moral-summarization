Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing from the original text. The article is about the South Korean government's response to the US's new climate policy under Bush, and it's using specific morally charged words like "challenges," "approach," "attacks," and "rejecting." 

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the key points. The article talks about the US's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which Bush introduced, and how the South Korean government reacts to it. They appreciate the US's interest and the new initiative but want more details. The US rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which is a significant international treaty, and this rejection was a point of criticism before 9/11.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words. So I should make sure to include "challenges," "approach," "attacks," and "rejecting" where appropriate. Also, the summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I should start by identifying the main points: the US's new policy, South Korea's appreciation but request for more details, the US's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, and the context of international reactions, including other countries like Japan and Germany having different tones.

I need to structure this into a coherent summary, making sure to use the moral terms. For example, the US's initiative addresses a "challenge," uses a "flexible approach," the "attacks" refer to the 9/11 context, and "rejecting" the Kyoto Protocol.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I should avoid adding any extra information not present in the original article. 

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the US's new policy, mention South Korea's appreciation, the flexible approach, the need for elaboration, the context of the Kyoto Protocol, the US's rejection, and the international reactions. Make sure to include all the morally framed words.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and properly formatted.

SUMMARY: The South Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative to address climate change, calling it a "challenge" of the 21st century. While acknowledging the "flexible and gradual approach" of the U.S. policy, Seoul emphasized the need for greater elaboration, particularly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, noted that the U.S. initiative should be discussed in future international forums alongside the Kyoto Protocol, which the U.S. had "rejected" under President George W. Bush. The protocol, requiring signatories to reduce emissions, has been ratified by over 180 countries, excluding the U.S. The Bush administration's decision to "reject" the Kyoto Protocol drew criticism internationally, especially before the September 11 terrorist "attacks." Meanwhile, other countries like Japan and Germany have responded to the U.S. climate policy with differing tones. END OF SUMMARY.
