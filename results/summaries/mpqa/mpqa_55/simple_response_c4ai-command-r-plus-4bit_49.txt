SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, expressing appreciation for the United States' continued interest and efforts in addressing climate change. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the flexible and gradual approach adopted by the U.S. initiative and its consideration of developing countries' concerns. However, it also points out the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Seoul government supports consultations among the international community to build understanding on the U.S. initiative and plans to actively participate in this process. This is a responsible and ethical stance, especially considering that over 180 countries, including South Korea and the United States, have been working towards the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the Bush administration's previous rejection of the Protocol drew criticism, its recent announcement of a new policy on climate change is a step in the right direction, and the South Korean government's response reflects a commitment to global environmental responsibility and cooperation.
