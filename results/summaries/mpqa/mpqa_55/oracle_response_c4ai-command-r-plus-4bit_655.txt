SUMMARY: The Republic of Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and their recent announcement of a new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The Korean government recognizes that the U.S. approach adopts a flexible and gradual strategy to reducing emissions, taking into account the concerns of developing nations. However, they also emphasize the need for further elaboration and concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels.

The Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty adopted in 1997 to control greenhouse gas emissions, has been the focus of ratification efforts by over 180 countries. The United States, led by President George W. Bush, initially rejected the protocol but now seeks to engage in international discussions with a new initiative. The Korean government believes that consultations are necessary to build understanding and will actively participate in this process.

It is important to note that before the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration faced severe criticism from the international community for their rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, have also issued statements on Bush's new policy, reflecting a range of perspectives on this challenging issue. END OF SUMMARY.
