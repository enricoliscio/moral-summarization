SUMMARY: The Republic of Korea appreciates the United States' continued interest and efforts in addressing climate change, a pressing challenge for humankind in the 21st century. The Korean government recognizes the flexible and gradual approach proposed by the U.S. initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while considering the concerns of developing nations. However, the initiative requires further elaboration, including concrete methods for establishing greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Republic of Korea emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding regarding the U.S. initiative and pledges active participation in this process. Over 180 countries, including the U.S., have been working towards the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework rejected by the Bush administration in favor of a new policy. Prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the administration faced severe criticism for this rejection. Other countries, such as Japan and Germany, have issued statements on the new U.S. climate policy, albeit with different tones. The Republic of Korea navigates a diplomatic response to the U.S.'s controversial move, acknowledging the initiative's potential while calling for further discussions and elaboration.
END OF SUMMARY.
