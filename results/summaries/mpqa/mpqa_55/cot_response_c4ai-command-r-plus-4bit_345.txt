SUMMARY:
The Republic of Korea has shown appreciation for the United States' continued interest in addressing climate change and their recent initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Korean government believes that the U.S. initiative takes a flexible and gradual approach and considers the concerns of developing countries. However, they also believe that more detailed discussions are needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. In light of the ongoing preparations for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a global framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Korean government emphasizes the importance of international consultations to build understanding around the U.S. initiative. They plan to actively participate in this process and encourage other countries to do the same. This news comes after the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the introduction of their new climate change policy, which has received mixed responses from other countries.
