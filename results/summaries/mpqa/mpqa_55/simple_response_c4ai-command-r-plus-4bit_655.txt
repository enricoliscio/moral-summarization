SUMMARY: The Republic of Korea welcomes the United States' renewed interest in addressing climate change and its recent proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic activity. While recognizing the flexible and gradual approach of the new US initiative and its consideration of developing countries' concerns, the Korean government emphasizes the need for further elaboration and concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement, issued by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, highlights the importance of international consultations to foster understanding of the US initiative and reiterates Korea's commitment to actively participating in these discussions. This development comes as over 180 countries, including the US, prepare for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark agreement for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, despite the Bush administration's previous rejection. However, Japan and Germany have responded with differing tones to the US's new climate policy. END OF SUMMARY.
