SUMMARY: The South Korean government has responded positively to U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which he proposed as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade appreciated the U.S.'s continued interest in addressing climate change and acknowledged the flexible and gradual approach of the new initiative, which takes into account the concerns of developing countries. However, Korea also suggested that more detailed elaboration is needed on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. Korea emphasized the need for international consultations to build understanding on the U.S. initiative and pledged to actively participate in this process. This development comes as over 180 countries prepare for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which the U.S. administration rejected in favor of its own policy focusing on relative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. had faced severe criticism from the international community for its initial rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, and other countries such as Japan and Germany have offered varied responses to Bush's new policy. END OF SUMMARY.
