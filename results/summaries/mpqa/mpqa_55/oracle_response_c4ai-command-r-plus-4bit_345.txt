SUMMARY: The South Korean government has issued a statement regarding U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, which he proposes as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The statement, released by Foreign Minister Choi Sung-hong, acknowledges the U.S.'s continued interest and efforts in addressing climate change, a significant challenge facing humanity in the 21st century. It appreciates the flexible and gradual approach adopted by the U.S. initiative, which also considers the concerns of developing nations. However, the Korean government emphasizes the need for further elaboration on concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. In light of the ongoing preparations for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by over 180 countries, the Korean government believes that international consultations are necessary to build understanding regarding the U.S. initiative, and it will actively participate in this process. The article also notes the criticism faced by the Bush administration prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the varying responses from other countries to Bush's new policy.
