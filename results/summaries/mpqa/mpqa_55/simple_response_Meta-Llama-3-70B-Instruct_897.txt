SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which aims to reduce emissions relative to economic activity. While appreciating the US's continued interest in addressing climate change, the Korean government notes that the new initiative takes a flexible and gradual approach, considering the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that the initiative requires further elaboration, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The Korean government also emphasizes the need for international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative, and will actively participate in this process. This response is significant, as the US had previously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and was criticized by the international community for doing so.
