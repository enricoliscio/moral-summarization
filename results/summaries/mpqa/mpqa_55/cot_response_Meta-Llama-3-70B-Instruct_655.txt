SUMMARY:
The Korean government has announced its position on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions, which is to be discussed internationally alongside the Kyoto Protocol. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in climate change and efforts to address this greatest challenge of the 21st century. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, it believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The government is of the view that international consultations are needed to build understanding on the US initiative, and Seoul will actively participate in this process. The US administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol last year was severely blamed by the international community. END OF SUMMARY.
