SUMMARY:
The South Korean government has announced its position on US President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions. The government appreciates the US's continued interest in climate change and efforts to address this greatest challenge of the 21st century. The Korean government notes that the new US initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, taking into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that greater elaboration is needed, including concrete methods to establish the levels of greenhouse gas intensity. The Seoul government will actively participate in international consultations to build understanding on the US initiative. This comes after the US administration was severely blamed by the international community for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol last year. END OF SUMMARY.
