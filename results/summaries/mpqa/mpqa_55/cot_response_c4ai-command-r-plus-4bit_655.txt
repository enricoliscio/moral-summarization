SUMMARY:
The Government of the Republic of Korea has issued a statement in response to U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy on greenhouse gas emissions, expressing its appreciation for the continued interest and efforts of the United States in addressing climate change. The Korean government believes that the new U.S. initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and takes into consideration the concerns of developing countries. However, the Korean government also believes that greater elaboration is needed for the U.S. initiative to be discussed in detail in future international forums, including concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement emphasizes the importance of consultations among the international community to build understanding and notes that the Seoul government will actively participate in this process. Over 180 countries, including the United States, have been preparing for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the Bush administration initially rejected the protocol, it has recently announced a new policy aiming to reduce emissions relative to economic activities. The Korean government's statement on Bush's new policy differs in tone from those of other countries, such as Japan and Germany.
