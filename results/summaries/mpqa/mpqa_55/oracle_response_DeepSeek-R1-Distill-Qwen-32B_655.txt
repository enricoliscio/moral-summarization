Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the article uses specific morally framed words: challenges, approach, attacks, and rejecting. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Korean government's response to the U.S. President George W. Bush's new climate policy. They appreciate the U.S.'s interest in climate change and the new initiative, but they also mention that more details are needed for the initiative to be discussed internationally. The article also mentions the Kyoto Protocol, which many countries, including the U.S., have prepared to ratify, but the Bush administration rejected it. There's a mention of the 9/11 attacks and how the U.S. was criticized before that.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by stating the Korean government's appreciation for the U.S. initiative, highlighting it as a challenge. I'll note the flexible approach and consideration for developing countries. Then, I'll mention that more elaboration is needed. I'll include the part about the Kyoto Protocol and the U.S. rejection, linking it to the 9/11 attacks and the criticism. Finally, I'll add that Korea supports international consultations and will participate actively.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the four moral words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The Korean government has expressed appreciation for the U.S. initiative on climate change, acknowledging it as a response to the significant challenges humanity faces in the 21st century. The government recognizes the U.S. approach as flexible and gradual, taking into account the concerns of developing countries. However, it emphasizes the need for greater elaboration, particularly regarding concrete methods to establish greenhouse gas intensity levels. The statement also highlights the importance of international consultations to build understanding of the U.S. initiative. Meanwhile, over 180 countries, including the U.S., have prepared for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration rejected. The article notes that before the September 11 attacks, the U.S. had faced criticism for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, and other countries like Japan and Germany have also commented on Bush's new policy. The Korean government reaffirms its commitment to actively participate in international discussions on climate change.  
END OF SUMMARY.
