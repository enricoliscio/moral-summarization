SUMMARY:

The South Korean government has responded to US President George W. Bush's new policy on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, acknowledging the "continued interest" shown by the US in addressing the "greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century". The Korean government appreciates the US's "flexible and gradual approach" to reducing emissions, which takes into account the concerns of developing countries. However, the government believes that the US initiative requires "greater elaboration" and "concrete methods" to establish emission levels. The statement also notes that the US's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol has been a point of contention, and that "consultations amongst the international community are needed to build understanding" on the new policy. The Korean government will actively participate in these consultations, aiming to address the "challenges" posed by climate change.
