SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there are concerns that it may not have latched properly into place. This has raised concerns about the potential damage to the orbiting complex if the space shuttle Endeavour launches tonight as planned. The issue arose when Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched during the docking process. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. While the supply ship was deemed secure enough to turn the steering system back on, Russia's Mission Control is still working to resolve the issue. This incident highlights the importance of attention to detail and caution in high-stakes situations, where even a small mistake can have significant consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
