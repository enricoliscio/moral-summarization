SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship experienced a potential issue during its docking procedure with the International Space Station. While the linkup initially appeared successful, there was uncertainty about whether the hooks had properly closed and latched. To address this, Russian flight controllers kept the space station's steering system off for an additional three hours while they assessed the situation. Power conservation measures were also implemented. Eventually, the supply ship was deemed to be securely attached, and the steering system was reactivated. The issue raised concerns about potential damage to the station if a similar problem were to occur during a shuttle docking, which could delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship was carrying over a ton of supplies, including food and fuel. The cause of the problem was being investigated by Russian engineers.
