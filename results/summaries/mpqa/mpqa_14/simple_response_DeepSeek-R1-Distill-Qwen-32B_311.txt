Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. They also mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I need to understand what the article is about.

The article talks about a Progress ship docking but possibly not latching properly. This could cause issues with the space shuttle launch. I need to make sure the summary captures the potential problem without making it too technical. 

I should start by identifying the main points: the docking, the possible issue with the latch, the concern for damage, the delay in the shuttle launch, and the actions taken by Russian controllers. 

Also, the moral framing here is about the potential risk to the space station and the mission. So I should highlight that the loose fit might damage the station and affect the shuttle launch. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and informative. I should avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward. 

Let me structure it: mention the docking, the possible issue, the concern, the impact on the shuttle, and the measures taken. That should cover all the key points while maintaining the moral aspect of the risk involved.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but there were concerns it may not have latched properly. NASA officials stated that the potential issue could delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour, scheduled for that night. The concern was that a loose fit might damage the ISS due to the force from a docking shuttle. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed properly. The ISS's steering system was turned off for three extra hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. Some equipment was temporarily shut off to conserve power. After evaluating the situation, Russian engineers concluded the ship was securely attached, and the steering system was restarted. The incident highlighted the risks associated with space operations and the importance of precise docking procedures to ensure the safety of the ISS and its crew. END OF SUMMARY.
