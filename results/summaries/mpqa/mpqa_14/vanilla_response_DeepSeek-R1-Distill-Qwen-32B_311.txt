Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article mentions that the Progress ship docked but might not have latched properly. NASA isn't sure if this will delay the Endeavour launch. The concern is that a loose fit could damage the station when another shuttle docks. The ship was launched from Kazakhstan, docked on time, but the hooks didn't latch as expected. The station's steering was off for an extra three hours, and some equipment was turned off to save power. After checking, they turned everything back on, but Russia's control team is still assessing.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the docking and the potential issue. Then mention the possible delay and the concern about damage. Include details about the ship's launch, the docking process, the latching problem, the extra time for checks, and the current status. Make sure it's clear and concise, ending with the ongoing assessment by Russian controllers.

Let me structure it step by step: docking, problem with latching, possible delay, concern about damage, ship details, checks done, current status, and ongoing assessment. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's all covered without unnecessary details.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly. NASA is uncertain whether this issue could delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour later that night. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched correctly. The station's steering system remained off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. Some equipment was powered down to conserve energy, but everything was later restored after determining the ship was securely attached. Russian Mission Control continued to evaluate the situation overnight. END OF SUMMARY.
