Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Russian supply ship docking issue with the International Space Station. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the potential risks and the cautious approach taken by the engineers.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The Progress ship docked but might not have latched properly, which could cause damage if the shuttle Endeavour launches. NASA and Russian controllers are concerned about the force from the shuttle affecting the loose fit. They turned off the station's steering system and some equipment to conserve power while assessing the issue.

I need to highlight the potential danger to the space station and the proactive measures taken to ensure safety. This shows the priority of caution in space operations. I'll structure the summary to mention the docking issue, the possible delay of the shuttle, the safety concerns, and the steps taken to resolve it.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral aspect of prioritizing safety over schedule. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly. NASA officials are uncertain if this issue could delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour later that night. The concern is that a loose fit could damage the ISS due to the force from a docking shuttle. The unmanned Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian flight controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched. The ISS's steering system was turned off for three extra hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem, and some equipment was powered down to conserve energy. After evaluation, Russian engineers concluded the supply ship was secure enough to reactivate the steering system. The situation highlights the cautious approach taken to ensure the safety of the ISS and its crew, even if it risks delaying the shuttle's launch. END OF SUMMARY.
