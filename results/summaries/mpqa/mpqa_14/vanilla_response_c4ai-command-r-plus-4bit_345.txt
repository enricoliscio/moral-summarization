SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship experienced a potential issue during its docking procedure with the International Space Station. While the linkup initially appeared successful, there was uncertainty about whether the hooks had properly latched. This raised concerns about potential damage to the space station due to the force exerted during shuttle dockings. In response, the space station's steering system was kept off for an extra three hours while Russian flight controllers assessed the situation. Power conservation measures were also implemented. The supply ship was eventually deemed secure enough for the steering system to be reactivated, but Russian engineers continued to evaluate the issue. The incident raises questions about the potential impact on the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour, scheduled for later that evening. The supply ship carried over a ton of supplies, including food and fuel.
END OF SUMMARY.
