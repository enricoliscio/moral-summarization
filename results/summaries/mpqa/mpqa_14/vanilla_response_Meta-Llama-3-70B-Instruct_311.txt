SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are concerned that a loose fit could damage the space station due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and pulled up to the space station on time. However, Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. The space station's steering system was turned off for three hours to allow Russian engineers to study the problem. Laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power, but was later turned back on after engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough. Russia's Mission Control is still assessing the problem, which may potentially delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight.

END OF SUMMARY.
