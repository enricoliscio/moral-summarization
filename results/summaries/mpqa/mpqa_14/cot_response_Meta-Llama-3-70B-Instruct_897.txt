SUMMARY:
A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there is a concern that it may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are worried about a potential problem that could delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight. The issue is that a loose fit might damage the orbiting complex due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. Russian flight controllers are working to assess the problem, and the space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to give them time to study the issue. Although the supply ship was attached securely enough to operate the steering system, Russia's Mission Control is still working to resolve the problem. The ship carried over a ton of food, fuel, and other supplies, and it is expected to fulfill its mission despite the initial hitch. END OF SUMMARY.
