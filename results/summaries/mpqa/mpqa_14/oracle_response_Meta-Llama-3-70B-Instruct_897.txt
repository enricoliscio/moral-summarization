SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship, carrying over a ton of crucial supplies, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose when it may not have latched properly into place, potentially putting the entire orbiting complex at risk of damage. NASA officials expressed uncertainty about whether this issue would delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight. The docking process initially seemed to go smoothly, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched securely. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was left off for an extra three hours, and some laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power. After a thorough assessment, Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough to operate the steering system. Russia's Mission Control worked through the night to further evaluate the problem, highlighting the importance of diligence and attention to detail in high-stakes operations. END OF SUMMARY.
