SUMMARY:
A potential issue with the docking of a Russian supply ship at the International Space Station has raised concerns among NASA officials. The ship may not have properly latched, and there is a concern that a loose fit could impart a force that might damage the space station. This concern has the potential to delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour, which is scheduled to deliver supplies to the station. The situation is being assessed by Russian flight controllers in Moscow, who did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched properly. As a precaution, the space station's steering system and some laboratory equipment were temporarily turned off to conserve power and ensure the security of the station until the supply ship's attachment could be verified. The situation raises questions about the potential risks and challenges of operating and maintaining a complex space station, highlighting the need for careful consideration of potential dangers and their mitigation.
