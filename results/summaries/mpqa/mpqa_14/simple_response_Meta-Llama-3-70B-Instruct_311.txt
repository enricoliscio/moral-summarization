SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly into place. This potential issue could pose a risk to the orbiting complex if the shuttle Endeavour, set to launch tonight, were to dock with a loose fit. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, initially seemed to link up successfully, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. Power was conserved by switching off laboratory equipment and other items. After determining the supply ship was securely attached, the steering system was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control continued to work through the night to resolve the issue. The incident highlights the importance of precision and attention to detail in space exploration to ensure the safety of the crew and the integrity of the space station.

END OF SUMMARY.
