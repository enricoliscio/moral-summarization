Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. The main issue is a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station but possibly not latching properly. This could cause delays for the upcoming shuttle launch. The concern is about potential damage from the docking force. 

Next, I'll note the morally framed words used by the author. These include "might have missed proper linkup," "potential problem," "delay," "concern," "loose fit might damage," "force imparted," "launched," "initially appeared to go well," "expected indication," "turned off," "conserved power," "turned back on," "attached securely enough," and "worked into the night." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to first state the docking issue, mention the potential delay, the concern about damage, the initial success, the problem with the hooks, the extra time taken, and the resolution. I'll ensure each of the morally framed words is included where appropriate.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the original moral tone. Let me draft the summary step by step, checking each point and including the necessary terms.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but might have missed proper linkup, raising concerns about potential damage from a loose fit. NASA officials expressed uncertainty about whether this issue would delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. The space station's steering system remained off for an extra three hours to assess the problem, and some equipment was turned off to conserve power. After Russian engineers determined the ship was attached securely enough, everything was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
