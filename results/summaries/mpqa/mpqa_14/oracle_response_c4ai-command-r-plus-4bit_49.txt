SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship's potential docking malfunction with the International Space Station raises **moral** concerns about the **integrity** of the orbiting complex. The unmanned Progress ship, carrying essential supplies, initially appeared to dock successfully, but NASA and Russian flight controllers encountered a potential issue. There was uncertainty about whether the hooks had closed and latched properly, leading to a possible **violation** of the station's **integrity**. The situation was **alarming** enough to keep the space station's steering system off for an extra three hours while engineers assessed the problem. Power conservation measures were implemented by switching off laboratory equipment and other items. The **relief** came when Russian engineers determined that the supply ship was attached securely, and the steering system could be reactivated. The situation raises questions about the **responsibility** of ensuring the **safety** and **structural integrity** of the space station in the face of potential **harm**. The article highlights the **duty** of space agencies to address these challenges and their **ethical** implications.
