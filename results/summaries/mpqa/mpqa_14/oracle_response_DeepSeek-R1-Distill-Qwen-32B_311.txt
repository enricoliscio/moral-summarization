Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the author's tone.

The article talks about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. There's a potential issue with the latching mechanism. NASA is concerned this might delay the shuttle launch. The Progress ship arrived on time, but the hooks didn't latch properly as indicated. They had to turn off the steering system and some equipment to conserve power. After some time, they decided it was secure enough to reactivate systems.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many morally framed words as possible. The author used words like "might have missed," "proper linkup," "potential problem," "delay," "damage," "force imparted," "loose fit," "expected indication," "turned off," "conserved," "assess," "worked into the night." I should include these terms to maintain the original framing.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the uncertainty and the cautious approach taken by the teams. Emphasizing the potential risks and the steps taken to mitigate them will convey the moral concern effectively. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but may not have latched properly, raising concerns about potential damage to the orbiting complex. NASA officials expressed uncertainty over whether this issue would delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive the expected confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched securely. The ISS's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem, with some equipment also switched off to conserve power. After analysis, Russian Mission Control determined the ship was attached securely enough to reactivate systems. The situation highlights the delicate nature of space operations and the need for precise coordination to avoid risks. END OF SUMMARY.
