SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are concerned that a loose fit could damage the space station due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and initially appeared to link up successfully. However, Russian flight controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched. The space station's steering system was turned off for three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the issue. Some laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power, but was later turned back on after it was determined the supply ship was attached securely enough. Russia's Mission Control is working to resolve the problem, which may impact tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour.
