Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down.

First, the user wants me to identify all single words in the article that are morally framed. They mentioned to label this step as "STEP 1:" and list each word with a * before them. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "problem," "delay," "damage," "safe," "securely," "extra," "conserved," "extraordinary," "thorough," "resilient," "stable," "reliable," and "critical" seem to fit. These words imply issues, safety concerns, and the importance of the situation.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure the summary captures the main points: the docking issue, potential delays, safety concerns, and the efforts made to resolve the problem.

I should also make sure the summary flows well and maintains the moral implications. I'll mention the Progress ship docking, the uncertainty about the latch, the possible delay for Endeavour, the safety risks, and the measures taken like powering down equipment and the eventual resolution after engineers' assessment.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, first listing the morally framed words, then crafting the summary with those words included. I should double-check that I'm not adding any new words beyond what's in the article and that the moral framing is preserved accurately.

Alright, I think I've got a good plan. I'll start by listing the words, then move on to the summary, making sure to incorporate the key points and the moral elements.

**SUMMARY:**  
A Russian supply ship docked to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but there was uncertainty about whether it had latched properly. NASA officials expressed concern that a loose fit could damage the ISS due to the force from an incoming shuttle. The unmanned Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The ISS's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the issue. Some equipment was powered down to conserve energy. After thorough evaluation, Russian engineers determined the ship was securely attached, and systems were restored. The potential problem raised concerns about a possible delay for the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour, though NASA remained hopeful the mission could proceed. The incident highlighted the critical importance of precise docking procedures to ensure the safety and stability of the ISS.
