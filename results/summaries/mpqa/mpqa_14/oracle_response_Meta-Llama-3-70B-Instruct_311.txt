SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly into place, raising fears of potential damage to the orbiting complex. NASA officials expressed uncertainty about whether this issue would delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of essential supplies, including food and fuel, had initially appeared to link up successfully, but Russian flight controllers failed to receive the expected confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was kept off for an extra three hours, and some laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power. After Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough, the systems were turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked through the night to assess the problem, striving to ensure the safety of the space station and its occupants.
