SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, carrying over a ton of essential supplies, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose as it may not have latched properly into place. This potential problem sparked uncertainty about tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour on a station delivery mission. The worry is that a loose fit could inflict damage on the orbiting complex due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. Initially, the linkup seemed to go smoothly, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was kept off for an extra three hours, and some laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power. After Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough, the systems were turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked through the night to assess the issue, highlighting the importance of caution and attention to detail in high-stakes space missions.

END OF SUMMARY.
