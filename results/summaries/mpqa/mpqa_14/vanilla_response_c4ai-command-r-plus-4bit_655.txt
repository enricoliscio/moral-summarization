SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship experienced a potential issue during its docking procedure with the International Space Station. The ship, carrying essential supplies, was launched from Kazakhstan and arrived at the station as scheduled. However, there was uncertainty about whether the hooks had latched properly. To address this concern, the space station's steering system was kept off for an extended period, and power-saving measures were implemented. Russian engineers later determined that the ship was secure enough for the steering system to be reactivated. The potential problem raised questions about whether it would impact the scheduled launch of space shuttle Endeavour, which was set to deliver supplies to the station. The issue was still being assessed by Russian Mission Control. The article highlights the complexities and challenges of space missions and the importance of ensuring the safety and integrity of the orbiting complex.
