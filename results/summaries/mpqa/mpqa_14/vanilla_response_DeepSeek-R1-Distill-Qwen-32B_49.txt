Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. Let me read through the article first.

So, the Progress ship docked on Wednesday, but there's a concern it didn't latch properly. NASA isn't sure if this will delay the Endeavour launch. The issue is that a loose fit might damage the station when another shuttle docks. The Progress ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday, docked on time, but the hooks didn't close as expected. The station's steering was off for three extra hours, and some equipment was turned off to save power. After checking, they turned everything back on because the ship was secure enough. Russian controllers are still assessing.

I need to make a concise summary. Start with the main event: the Progress ship docked but may not have latched properly. Mention the potential delay for Endeavour's launch. Explain the concern about damage from another docking. Include details about the docking process, the unexpected issue, the extra time for checks, and the current status. Keep it under 200 words.

Let me structure it: mention the docking, the possible improper latching, the concern for damage, the impact on the shuttle launch, the initial success, the unexpected issue with hooks, the extra time, power conservation, and the current assessment.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the event, the problem, the implications, and the current status.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there are concerns it may not have latched properly. NASA is unsure if this issue could delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers didn't receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The station's steering system remained off for three extra hours, and some equipment was turned off to conserve power. After assessment, everything was restarted as the ship was deemed secure enough. Russian engineers are still evaluating the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
