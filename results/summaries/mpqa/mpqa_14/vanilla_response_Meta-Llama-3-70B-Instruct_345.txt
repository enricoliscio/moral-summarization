SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are concerned that a loose fit could damage the space station due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and initially appeared to dock successfully. However, Russian flight controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for three hours, and some laboratory equipment was shut down to conserve power. After Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough, the systems were turned back on. Russia's Mission Control is still assessing the problem, which may potentially delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour. END OF SUMMARY.
