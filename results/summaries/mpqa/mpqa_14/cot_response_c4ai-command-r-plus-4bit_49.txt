SUMMARY:
There is a concern that a Russian supply ship may not have properly latched to the International Space Station, potentially delaying the launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The issue raises a problem as the force of a docking shuttle could damage the orbiting complex. Although the Progress ship, carrying essential supplies, appeared to dock successfully, Russian flight controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had latched. This led to a delay in activating the station's steering system and the need to conserve power by switching off certain equipment. Russian engineers assured that the supply ship was attached securely enough for steering operations, but Mission Control is still assessing the situation to determine the next steps. The primary worry is that a loose fit could result in damage to the space station. NASA officials are evaluating whether this issue will postpone Endeavour's launch, scheduled for tonight.
END OF SUMMARY.
