SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose when it may not have latched properly into place, sparking worries about potential damage to the orbiting complex. NASA officials expressed uncertainty about whether the issue would delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour on a station delivery mission. The unmanned Progress ship, carrying vital supplies, initially appeared to have linked up successfully, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched securely. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was left off for an extra three hours, and some laboratory equipment was switched off to conserve power. After Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough, everything was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to assess the problem, highlighting the importance of diligence and attention to detail in high-stakes space missions. END OF SUMMARY.
