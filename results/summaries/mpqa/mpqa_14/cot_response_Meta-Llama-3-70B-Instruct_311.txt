SUMMARY:
A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but NASA officials expressed concern that it may not have latched properly into place. The potential problem could delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour on a station delivery mission. The worry is that a loose fit might cause damage to the orbiting complex due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. Russian flight controllers outside Moscow did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. To conserve power, some laboratory equipment and other items were switched off. After Russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough, everything was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to assess the problem, trying to ensure a secure connection. END OF SUMMARY.
