Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that a Russian Progress ship docked on Wednesday but might not have latched properly. NASA isn't sure if this will delay the Endeavour shuttle launch. The concern is that a loose fit could damage the station when the shuttle docks. The Progress ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and docked on time, but the hooks didn't close as expected. The station's steering system was off for an extra three hours while they checked the issue. Some equipment was turned off to save power, but everything was restarted after engineers confirmed the ship was secure. Russian mission control worked late to assess the problem.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the docking issue, potential delay, concern about damage, the process of checking, and the resolution. I'll start by stating the docking and the potential issue. Then mention the possible delay and the concern about damage. Next, explain that the hooks didn't close properly, the steering system was off, and equipment was turned off. Finally, note that everything was restarted after engineers confirmed it was secure, and Russian control worked late.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all important aspects without getting too detailed. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly. NASA is unsure if this issue will delay the upcoming launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The station's steering system remained off for an extra three hours as engineers assessed the problem. Some equipment was powered down to conserve energy, but everything was restarted after engineers confirmed the ship was securely attached. Russian mission control worked late to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
