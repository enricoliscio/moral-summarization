SUMMARY:
A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but NASA officials raised a concern that it may not have latched properly into place. This potential problem could delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of essential supplies, initially appeared to link up well, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to give Russian engineers time to study the problem. After determining the supply ship was attached securely enough, the steering system was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to assess the issue, ensuring the safety of the orbiting complex. END OF SUMMARY.
