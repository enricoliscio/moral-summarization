Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. There might have been an issue with the latching, which could have caused delays for the Endeavour shuttle launch. The author used words like "might have missed proper linkup," "potential problem," "concern," "loose fit," "damage," "force imparted," "initially appeared to go well," "expected indication," "turned off," "conserved power," "turned back on," "securely enough," "worked into the night," "assess," and "problem."

I need to make sure the summary includes these words as much as possible. The user also specified that the summary should be no longer than 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

So, I'll start by stating that the Russian supply ship docked but might not have latched properly. Then mention the potential problem and the concern about damaging the station. I'll note that the docking was on time and initial success, but the hooks didn't latch as expected. The steering system was off longer, and some equipment was turned off to conserve power. After engineers assessed, everything was turned back on. Russia's control worked late to assess.

I should keep the sentences concise and include all the moral terms. Let me piece this together without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station, but it might have missed proper linkup, potentially causing a loose fit that could damage the station. NASA expressed concern that this issue might delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers didn't receive the expected indication that the hooks had latched properly. The station's steering system remained off for an extra three hours to assess the problem, and some equipment was turned off to conserve power. After engineers determined the ship was securely attached, systems were restored. Russian Mission Control worked late to assess the problem. END OF SUMMARY.
