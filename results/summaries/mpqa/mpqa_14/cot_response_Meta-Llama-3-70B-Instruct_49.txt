SUMMARY:
A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but a potential problem arose as it may not have latched properly into place, raising concern about the safety of the orbiting complex. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of essential supplies, initially appeared to have linked up successfully, but Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the issue. Although the supply ship was deemed securely attached, Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to investigate the problem, which may impact tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The situation is being closely monitored to ensure the safe operation of the space station.
