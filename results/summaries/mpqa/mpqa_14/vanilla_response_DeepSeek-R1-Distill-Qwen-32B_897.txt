Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that a Russian Progress ship docked on Wednesday but might not have latched properly. NASA isn't sure if this will delay the Endeavour shuttle launch. The concern is that a loose fit could damage the station when another shuttle docks. The Progress ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday, docked on time, but the hooks didn't close as expected. The station's steering system was off for an extra three hours, and some equipment was turned off to save power. After checking, they restarted everything, thinking it's secure enough.

So, the main points are:
1. Progress ship docked but may not have latched properly.
2. Potential delay for Endeavour's launch.
3. Risk of damage if another shuttle docks.
4. Steering system was off longer, equipment turned off, then restarted after assessment.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the docking issue, mention the possible delay, the risk, and the steps taken by the crew. I should make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the important points without extra details.

SUMMARY: A Russian Progress supply ship docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday but may not have latched properly, raising concerns about potential delays for the space shuttle Endeavour's planned launch. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on schedule, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The station's steering system was off for an extra three hours, and some equipment was powered down to conserve energy. After assessment, Russian engineers concluded the ship was securely attached, allowing systems to restart. The issue could pose risks if another shuttle docks, but NASA is currently assessing whether it will affect the Endeavour mission. END OF SUMMARY.
