SUMMARY:
A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there is a concern that it may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are unsure if this potential problem will delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight. The issue arose when Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched, raising concerns that a loose fit might damage the orbiting complex. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to give Russian engineers time to study the problem. After determining the supply ship was attached securely enough, the steering system was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control is working to assess the problem, and NASA is monitoring the situation closely. END OF SUMMARY.
