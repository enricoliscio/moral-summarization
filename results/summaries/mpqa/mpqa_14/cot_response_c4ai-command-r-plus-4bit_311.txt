SUMMARY:
There is a concern that a Russian supply ship may not have properly latched onto the International Space Station, possibly causing a problem that could delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour. The issue at hand is the potential damage to the orbiting complex due to the force exerted by a docking shuttle. Although the unmanned Progress ship, carrying essential supplies, appeared to dock successfully, Russian flight controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed and latched properly. As a precaution, the space station's steering system and some equipment were temporarily turned off to conserve power while engineers assessed the situation. Initial assessments suggest that the supply ship is attached securely enough for the steering system to operate, but Russian Mission Control is continuing to evaluate the issue. The situation raises questions about the potential implications for the upcoming shuttle launch and the overall integrity of the space station.
