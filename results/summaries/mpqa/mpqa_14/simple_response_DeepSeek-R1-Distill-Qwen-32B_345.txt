Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Russian supply ship docking issue. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that a Russian Progress ship docked but might not have latched properly. NASA is concerned this could delay the shuttle launch and damage the space station. They turned off the steering system and some equipment to conserve power. After some time, they turned everything back on, deciding it was secure enough.

I need to highlight the potential risks and the measures taken. The moral framing here is about the importance of international cooperation and safety in space missions. The summary should reflect the collaboration between NASA and Russia, the precautions taken to prevent damage, and the successful resolution.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the docking issue, mention the potential delay and risks, then the steps taken and the resolution. I'll make sure to include that it's a joint effort, emphasizing teamwork and safety.

Let me structure it: mention the docking issue, the concerns about delay and damage, the actions taken (turning off systems), and the resolution. I'll make sure to include the key details without getting too technical.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise summary that maintains the moral aspects of cooperation and safety.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly, potentially delaying the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. NASA and Russian flight controllers are assessing whether the loose fit could damage the ISS due to docking forces. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The ISS's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours, and some equipment was powered down to conserve energy. After evaluating the situation, Russian engineers concluded the ship was securely attached, allowing systems to be restarted. The incident highlights the critical importance of precise operations in space missions and the need for international cooperation to ensure the safety of the ISS and its crew. END OF SUMMARY.
