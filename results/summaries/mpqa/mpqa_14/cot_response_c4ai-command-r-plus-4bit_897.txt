SUMMARY:
A potential problem with the docking of a Russian supply ship at the International Space Station raises concerns about possible damage to the orbiting complex. NASA officials worry that if the ship is not securely latched, the force of a docking shuttle could harm the space station. The situation prompts Russian flight controllers to keep the station's steering system off for an extra three hours while they assess the issue. Laboratory equipment and other items are conserved to preserve power during this time. Engineers eventually determine that the supply ship is attached securely enough for the steering system to operate, but Russia's Mission Control continues to evaluate the problem. The situation also raises questions about whether the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour will be delayed. The supply ship, carrying over a ton of food, fuel, and supplies, initially appeared to dock successfully, but the expected indication of closed and latched hooks was not received by flight controllers.
