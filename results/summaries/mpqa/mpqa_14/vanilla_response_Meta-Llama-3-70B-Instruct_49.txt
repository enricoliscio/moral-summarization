SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but NASA officials are concerned that it may not have latched properly into place. The ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and initially appeared to link up successfully. However, Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. Laboratory equipment and other items were also switched off to conserve power. After determining the supply ship was attached securely enough, the steering system was turned back on. The issue may potentially delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight, but NASA officials are still evaluating the situation.

END OF SUMMARY.
