SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there are concerns that it may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials are unsure if this potential problem will delay the planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour tonight. The issue is that a loose fit could damage the space station due to the force imparted by a docking shuttle. Although the linkup initially appeared to go well, Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. The space station's steering system was turned off for an extra three hours to allow Russian engineers to study the problem. After determining the supply ship was attached securely enough, the steering system was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control is still working to assess the problem. The supply ship is carrying over a ton of food, fuel, and other supplies. END OF SUMMARY.
