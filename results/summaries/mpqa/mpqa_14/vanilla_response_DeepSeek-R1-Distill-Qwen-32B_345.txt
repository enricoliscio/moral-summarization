Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article mentions that a Russian Progress ship docked on Wednesday but might not have latched properly. NASA isn't sure if this will delay the Endeavour shuttle launch. The concern is that a loose fit could damage the station when the shuttle docks. The Progress ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday, docked on time, but the hooks didn't latch as expected. Russian controllers had to keep the steering system off longer, and some equipment was turned off to save power. After checking, they concluded it was secure enough to reactivate systems.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the docking issue, mention the potential delay for Endeavour, the risk of damage, and the steps taken by Russian controllers. I'll make sure to include key details like the Progress ship's cargo, the initial successful docking, the latching problem, and the resolution.

I should structure it so each sentence covers a main point without getting too technical. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown or extra formatting. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday, but there were concerns it may not have latched properly. NASA is unsure if this issue will delay the planned launch of the space shuttle Endeavour later that night. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on time, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had closed. The station's steering system was turned off for three extra hours to assess the problem, and some equipment was powered down to conserve energy. After analysis, Russian engineers determined the ship was secure enough to reactivate systems. The potential loose fit could pose risks if the Endeavour docks, as it might damage the station. END OF SUMMARY.
