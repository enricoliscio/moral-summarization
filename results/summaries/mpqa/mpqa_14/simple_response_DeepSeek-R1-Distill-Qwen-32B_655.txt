Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a Russian supply ship docking with the International Space Station. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the potential risks and the actions taken to address them. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The Progress ship docked but might not have latched properly. This could cause damage when the shuttle Endeavour arrives. NASA is concerned about a possible delay in the shuttle's launch. The ship was launched from Kazakhstan, docked on time, but the hooks didn't latch as expected. The station's steering was off for extra time, and some equipment was turned off to save power. After assessment, everything was turned back on, and the ship was deemed secure enough.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include the uncertainty about the docking, the potential risk to the station, the impact on the shuttle launch, and the measures taken to resolve the issue. Also, highlighting the cooperation between Russian and NASA controllers is important for the moral aspect, showing teamwork in a critical situation.

I'll start by stating the docking issue, mention the potential problem, the impact on the shuttle, and then the steps taken to assess and resolve it. I'll end with the outcome, emphasizing that the ship was secure enough. Keeping the language clear and sticking to the key points without adding extra details.

SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, but concerns arose that it may not have latched properly, potentially risking damage to the station when the space shuttle Endeavour arrives. NASA expressed uncertainty about whether this issue could delay Endeavour's planned launch. The Progress ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, docked on schedule, but Russian controllers did not receive confirmation that the hooks had secured properly. The ISS's steering system was temporarily shut off, delaying its restart by three hours to allow for problem assessment. Some station equipment was powered down to conserve energy during this period. After evaluation, Russian engineers concluded the ship was securely attached, and systems were restored. The incident highlights the critical importance of precise docking procedures to ensure the safety and integrity of the ISS. END OF SUMMARY.
