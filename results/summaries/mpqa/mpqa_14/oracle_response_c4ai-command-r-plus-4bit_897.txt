SUMMARY: A potentially **harmful** situation unfolded at the International Space Station when a Russian supply ship experienced a less-than-ideal docking procedure. The **concern** is that the ship may not have **latched** properly, and this could **damage** the station when the shuttle **imparts force** during its own docking. NASA officials are assessing the **problem** and determining if the shuttle launch, intended to deliver supplies to the station, will need to be **delayed**. The supply ship, launched from Kazakstan, arrived on schedule, but **troubling** indications were observed by Russian flight controllers, who noticed that the hooks designed to secure the ship did not appear to have closed and **latched** as expected. This prompted them to keep the station's steering system off for an **extended period** while they investigated, **conserve power** by turning off non-essential equipment, and ultimately **conclude** that the ship was attached securely enough to **resume** operations. The situation raises **worries** about the potential **damage** a loose latch could cause, and the NASA team is evaluating the best course of action to **address** this challenge.

END OF SUMMARY.
