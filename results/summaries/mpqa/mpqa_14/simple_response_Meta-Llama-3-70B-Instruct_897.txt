SUMMARY:

A Russian supply ship, Progress, docked at the International Space Station on Wednesday, but NASA officials raised concerns that it may not have latched properly into place. This potential issue could delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour, scheduled for tonight, as a loose fit could damage the orbiting complex. The unmanned ship, carrying over a ton of supplies, was launched from Kazakhstan on Monday and initially appeared to dock successfully. However, Russian flight controllers did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. As a precaution, the space station's steering system was turned off for three hours to allow Russian engineers to assess the problem. Power was conserved by switching off laboratory equipment and other items. After determining the supply ship was securely attached, the steering system was turned back on. Russia's Mission Control continued to work through the night to resolve the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
