SUMMARY: A Russian supply ship experienced a potential issue during its docking procedure with the International Space Station. The ship, carrying supplies and equipment, may not have latched properly, raising concerns about potential damage to the space station. NASA officials are assessing whether this will delay the launch of space shuttle Endeavour, scheduled for later that day. The issue occurred when Russian flight controllers did not receive an indication that the hooks had closed and latched properly. To address the issue, the space station's steering system was kept off for an extra three hours, and power-saving measures were implemented. Russian engineers determined that the supply ship was secure enough for the steering system to operate, and they continued to assess the problem. The supply ship, launched from Kazakstan, was carrying over a ton of food, fuel, and supplies. The successful linkup with the space station, despite the potential latching issue, highlights the complexity and challenges of space exploration and the importance of careful monitoring and problem-solving.
END OF SUMMARY.
