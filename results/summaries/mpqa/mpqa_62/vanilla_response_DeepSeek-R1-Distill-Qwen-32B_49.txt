Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the space shuttle Endeavour docking with the International Space Station. The user has provided the article and wants a concise summary of 200 words or less, ending with specific tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key details are: Endeavour docked with the ISS, delivering a new 3-man crew to replace the existing one. The docking happened 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border after a two-day journey. The outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, has been there since August. Culbertson mentioned feeling isolated after 9/11. The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, who will stay until May.

I should structure the summary to include these points: the docking event, the new crew, the outgoing crew's experience, Culbertson's feelings, and the new crew's mission duration. I need to make it concise, so I'll combine these into a few sentences without unnecessary details. Also, I need to ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me draft it: Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the ISS, delivering a new crew. The docking occurred after a two-day trip, 250 miles above Poland and Ukraine. The outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, has been there since August. Culbertson felt isolated after 9/11. The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko as commander and two Americans, staying until May.

I should check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Let me count the words in the draft. It's concise, so I think it's good. I'll format it with the required tokens.
