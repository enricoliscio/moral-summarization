SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the crew that had been stationed there since August. The shuttle approached the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, marking the end of a two-day chase. Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been on the space station for four months, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He was joined by two Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, who will return to Earth with him. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, American Carl Walz, and American Daniel Bursch, will take their places and remain on the space station until May. The arrival of Endeavour was celebrated in the tradition of the high seas, with Culbertson ringing the ship's bell and announcing "Endeavour arriving."
END OF SUMMARY.
