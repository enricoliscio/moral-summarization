SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour has successfully docked with the international space station, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew who have been on board since August. The shuttle, carrying Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, ended a two-day chase to reach the space station, orbiting 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border. Outgoing space station commander Frank Culbertson, who has been on board for four months, expressed relief and eagerness to return home, having felt isolated and frustrated after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will depart the space station today, making way for the new crew who will stay on board until May.

END OF SUMMARY.
