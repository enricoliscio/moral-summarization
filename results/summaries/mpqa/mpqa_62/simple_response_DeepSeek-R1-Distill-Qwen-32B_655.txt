Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Endeavour space shuttle docking with the International Space Station. It mentions the delivery of a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew. The commander, Frank Culbertson, is eager for his return home and reflects on his feelings of isolation after the September 11 attacks. There's also a mention of the traditional ship's bell ringing and the change in crew members.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words. I should focus on the main events and the emotional aspect mentioned. It's important to highlight Culbertson's feelings as that adds the moral element the user is emphasizing.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the docking event, then mention the arrival of the new crew. I'll include Culbertson's eagerness and his feelings of isolation and frustration post-9/11. Finally, I'll note the transition of the crew and the new commander.

I should make sure the summary is concise, captures the emotional tone, and stays within the word limit. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the current crew, who have been on the station since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. ISS commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed his eagerness for the arrival of Endeavour, which would mark his return home. Culbertson, along with his Russian crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, reflected on their four-month mission, during which Culbertson felt isolated and frustrated after the September 11 terrorist attacks. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson rang the ship's bell and announced, "Endeavour arriving," in a traditional maritime gesture. The departing crew will return to Earth, while the new crew—Russian commander Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch—will remain on the ISS until May.
