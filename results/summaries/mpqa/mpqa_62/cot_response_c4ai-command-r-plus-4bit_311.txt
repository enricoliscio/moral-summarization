SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the crew that had been stationed there since August. The arrival was eagerly awaited by the current space station commander, Frank Culbertson, who expressed feelings of isolation and frustration during his four-month stay, particularly following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The current crew, consisting of Culbertson and two Russians, will be relieved by the incoming trio: Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch. The handover process will take place over the next day, with the new crew scheduled to remain aboard the space station until May. This shuttle docking marks a moment of relief and a change of command for the space station, providing a sense of renewed connection and support for those dedicated to space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
