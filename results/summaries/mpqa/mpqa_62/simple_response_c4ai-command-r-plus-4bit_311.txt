SUMMARY: Relief and camaraderie arrived at the International Space Station orbiting 250 miles above Earth when the Space Shuttle Endeavour docked, bringing a fresh crew to replace those who had been in space since August. The previous commander, Frank Culbertson, had experienced a sense of isolation and frustration, especially after the September 11 terrorist attacks, as his only company were two Russian crewmates. The arrival of Endeavour, with its ghostly appearance against the blackness of space, signaled a much-needed change. Culbertson, in keeping with maritime tradition, rang a bell and announced the ship's arrival. He and his Russian crewmates will return to Earth, while a new trio, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take their place aboard the station until May. This story highlights the importance of human connection and the need for support and relief, even in the vastness of space. Culbertson's experience also underscores the impact of isolation and the unifying effect of shared challenges, such as those faced by the world in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.
