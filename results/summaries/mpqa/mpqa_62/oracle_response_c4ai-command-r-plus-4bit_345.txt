SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the international space station, delivering a new crew to relieve those who had been stationed there since August, including commander Frank Culbertson who experienced feelings of isolation and frustration following the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11th. Endeavour's arrival brought a sense of relief and camaraderie as Culbertson eagerly awaited his ride home. He watched as the shuttle approached, a ghostly figure against the vastness of space, and rang the ship's bell in accordance with maritime tradition, announcing "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his crewmates, who had endured the challenges of isolation and a prolonged stay in space, were relieved by the incoming three-person team. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, prepared to take on their duties aboard the space station until May. This peaceful meeting in space, 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, offered a brief respite from the tragic events unfolding on Earth, particularly the heartache and devastation caused by the terrorist attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
