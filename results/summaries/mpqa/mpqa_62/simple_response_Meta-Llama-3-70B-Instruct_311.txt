SUMMARY:

In a moment of relief and reunion, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a new three-member crew to replace the team that has been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson, who had felt isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the shuttle drew closer, Culbertson radioed his excitement, and upon final approach, he rang the ship's bell, declaring "Endeavour arriving" in a nod to maritime tradition. The outgoing crew, including Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, will return home, making way for the new team, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will stay on board until May. This momentous occasion marks a new chapter in the ongoing space station mission, and serves as a testament to the resilience and cooperation of the international space community.
