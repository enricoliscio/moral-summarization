SUMMARY:
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been stationed there since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was eagerly awaiting his ride home. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson radioed "We're ready to see you guys" and later rang the ship's bell, announcing "Endeavour arriving" in a tradition reminiscent of the high seas. Culbertson and his crewmates will depart the space station, making way for the new crew, including Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will stay on board until May. The successful docking marks a new chapter in the space station's operations. END OF SUMMARY.
