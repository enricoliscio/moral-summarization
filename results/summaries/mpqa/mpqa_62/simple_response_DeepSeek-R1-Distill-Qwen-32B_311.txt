Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the Endeavour space shuttle docking with the International Space Station, delivering a new crew. The key points are the docking event, the relief of the existing crew, especially Frank Culbertson's feelings after 9/11, and the transition of the crew.

I should start by mentioning the docking and the delivery of the new crew. Then, highlight Culbertson's eagerness and his feelings of isolation post-9/11. I need to convey his emotions clearly. Also, include the traditional ship's bell ringing as a nice touch showing the human element. Finally, mention the crew changeover and the new members staying until May.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspects like Culbertson's emotional state are preserved. I'll structure it to flow smoothly from the docking to the crew's emotions and the transition.

SUMMARY:  
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing astronauts who had been on board since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. Station commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief and shared his feelings of isolation and frustration following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return to Earth, while the new crew—Russian Yuri Onufrienko, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch—will take their place, staying aboard until May. Culbertson marked the arrival with a traditional ship's bell ringing, declaring, "Endeavour arriving."  
END OF SUMMARY.
