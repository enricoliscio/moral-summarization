SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the international space station, delivering a new crew to relieve the previous crew members, including Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been stationed there since August. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration following the September terrorist attacks on the United States. He and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, were replaced by a new team led by Russian Yuri Onufrienko, with Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will remain aboard until May. The shuttle approached the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. The crew changeover marks a significant milestone in the ongoing international collaboration in space exploration, providing a much-needed relief for the previous crew and ensuring the continuation of research and scientific endeavors aboard the space station.
END OF SUMMARY.
