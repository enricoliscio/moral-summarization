STEP 1:
*frustrated*

SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, bringing a new three-man crew to relieve the current crew, who had been stationed there since August. The incoming commander, Frank Culbertson, expressed his eagerness to return home after feeling *frustrated* and isolated following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will hand over their duties to the new crew, consisting of Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, who will remain on the space station until May. The handover marks the end of a two-day chase and a four-month mission for the outgoing crew.
END OF SUMMARY.
