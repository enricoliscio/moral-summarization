SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the crew who had been stationed there since August. The shuttle approached the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. The current space station commander, Frank Culbertson, expressed his eagerness to return to Earth after feeling isolated and frustrated following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, along with his crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will be relieved by the new crew: Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, who will remain on the space station until May. The new crew will take their places following the transfer today.
END OF SUMMARY.
