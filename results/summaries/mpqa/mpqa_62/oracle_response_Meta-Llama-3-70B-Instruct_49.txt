SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the team that had been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for space station commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, was eager to return home and welcomed the arrival of Endeavour, saying "We're ready to see you guys" as the shuttle approached. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties on the space station until May. The mission marks a new chapter for the space station, bringing a sense of relief and renewal after a period of uncertainty and fear following the devastating attacks.
