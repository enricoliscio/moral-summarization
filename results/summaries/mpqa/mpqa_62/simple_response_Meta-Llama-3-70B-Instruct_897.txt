SUMMARY:

In a moment of relief and reunion, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to replace the team that has been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the shuttle drew closer, Culbertson radioed his excitement, and upon final approach, he rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving" in a nod to maritime tradition. The outgoing crew, including Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, will return home, while the new team, comprising Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take up residence until May. This momentous occasion highlights the importance of international cooperation and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.
