Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used the word "attacks," which is a morally charged term. I should make sure to include that in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Endeavour shuttle docked with the ISS, delivering a new crew. The old crew, including Culbertson, has been there since August. Culbertson felt isolated after the September 11 attacks. The docking happened 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border. The new crew will stay until May.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the docking, mention the new crew replacing the old one. Include Culbertson's feelings of isolation after the attacks. Mention the docking details briefly. End with the new crew's stay duration.

I should ensure the word "attacks" is included. Also, keep the summary concise and clear, maintaining the moral aspect by referencing the attacks' impact on Culbertson.

Let me structure it: docking event, new crew arrival, old crew's feelings, docking specifics, and the new crew's stay. Keep each point brief.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS), delivering a new three-member crew to replace the current crew, who have been on the station since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. ISS commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief at Endeavour's arrival, as his four-month stay had been marked by isolation and frustration following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return to Earth today, making way for the new crew led by Russian commander Yuri Onufrienko, along with Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will remain on the station until May.  
END OF SUMMARY.
