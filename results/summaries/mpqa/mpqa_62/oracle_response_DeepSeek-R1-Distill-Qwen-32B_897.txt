Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key morally framed word here is "attacks," which refers to the September 11 attacks. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The shuttle Endeavour docked with the ISS, delivering a new crew to relieve the current one. Commander Culbertson has been there since August and is eager to return home. He mentioned feeling isolated and frustrated after the attacks.

I should focus on the docking event, the relief of the crew, and Culbertson's emotional state post-September 11. I need to include the word "attacks" to maintain the moral framing. 

I'll structure the summary to include the docking details, Culbertson's feelings, the new crew members, and their mission duration. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while ensuring the moral aspect is clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to highlight the impact of the attacks on Culbertson and his crew. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the docking, then Culbertson's experience, and ending with the new crew's arrival.

SUMMARY:  
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS), delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the current crew, who have been onboard since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. ISS commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief at Endeavour's arrival, as his four-month mission had become isolating and frustrating following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return home, while the new crew—Russian Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch—will take over until May. The arrival marked a symbolic moment, with Culbertson ringing the ship's bell and announcing, "Endeavour arriving," in a nod to maritime tradition.  
END OF SUMMARY.
