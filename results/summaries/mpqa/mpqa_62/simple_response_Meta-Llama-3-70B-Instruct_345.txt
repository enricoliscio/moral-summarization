SUMMARY:

In a remarkable display of international cooperation and resilience, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the team that had been on board since August. The arrival marked a poignant moment for space station commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the September 11 terrorist attacks. As Endeavour drew closer, Culbertson radioed his excitement, and with the final 40 feet, he rang the ship's bell, announcing "Endeavour arriving‚Äù in a nod to the high seas tradition. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties until May, while Culbertson and his crewmates return home. This momentous occasion serves as a beacon of hope and unity in the face of adversity.
