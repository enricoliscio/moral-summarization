SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been on board since August. The shuttle's arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for space station commander Frank Culbertson, who had felt isolated and frustrated after the devastating Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, was eager to return home and was thrilled to see the Endeavour arrive, radioing "We're ready to see you guys" as the shuttle drew near. As the Endeavour closed in, Culbertson rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving" in a traditional naval ceremony. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties on the space station until May.
