SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the previous crew who had been stationed there since August. The shuttle approached the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day chase. Commander Frank Culbertson of the space station was eager to return to Earth after his four-month stay, expressing feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He, along with his Russian crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will be relieved by the new crew: Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, who will remain on the space station until May. Endeavour's arrival was marked with excitement and tradition, as Culbertson rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving." The new crew will take their places and continue the important work of space exploration and research.
END OF SUMMARY.
