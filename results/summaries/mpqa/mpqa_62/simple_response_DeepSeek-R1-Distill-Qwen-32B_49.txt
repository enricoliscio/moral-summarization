Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the space shuttle Endeavour docking with the International Space Station (ISS). It mentions that a new three-member crew arrived to relieve the existing crew who have been there since August. The shuttle docked after a two-day journey, 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border. 

I notice that the commander, Frank Culbertson, is eager for the arrival because it's his ride home. He mentions feeling isolated and frustrated after the September 11 attacks. That's an important moral point because it shows the emotional impact on the astronauts during a difficult time.

The article also talks about the tradition of ringing the bell and announcing the arrival, which adds a human touch and a sense of camaraderie. The crew is changing over, with the new members staying until May.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the docking, the relief of the crew, Culbertson's feelings, the tradition, and the transition of crew members. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral elements like isolation and the emotional impact.

Let me structure the summary to first state the docking, then mention the new crew arriving, Culbertson's feelings, the tradition, and the crew change. I'll ensure it's clear and flows well.

I should avoid any technical jargon and keep the language simple. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is included without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS), delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew who had been aboard since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border after a two-day journey. ISS commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief at Endeavour's arrival, as it marked his return home after a four-month mission. Culbertson, who felt isolated and frustrated following the September 11 terrorist attacks, watched as the shuttle approached. In a tradition reminiscent of maritime customs, he rang the station's bell and announced, "Endeavour arriving." The departing crew, including Culbertson and two Russian astronauts, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return to Earth, while the new crew—Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch—will take their place, staying aboard until May. END OF SUMMARY.
