SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour *eagerly* docked with the international space station, delivering a fresh crew to replace those who had been stationed there for four months. The arrival was met with anticipation by the current commander, Frank Culbertson, who expressed feelings of *isolation* and *frustration* due to the September 11th terrorist attacks. In *tradition*, Culbertson rang the ship's bell to announce Endeavour's arrival. The new crew, consisting of Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, will take their places and remain aboard the space station until May.
END OF SUMMARY.
