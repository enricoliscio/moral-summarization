SUMMARY:

In a remarkable display of international cooperation and scientific achievement, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been stationed there since August. The arrival of Endeavour marked the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson, who had felt isolated and frustrated following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the shuttle drew closer, Culbertson's excitement was palpable, and he formally announced the arrival of Endeavour in a tradition reminiscent of the high seas. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over the space station until May, marking a new chapter in this extraordinary endeavor.
