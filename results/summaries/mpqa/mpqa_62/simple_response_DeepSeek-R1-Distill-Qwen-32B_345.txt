Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about the space shuttle Endeavour docking with the International Space Station. It delivered a new crew to relieve the current one. The commander, Frank Culbertson, has been up there since August and mentions feeling isolated after 9/11. That's an important point because it adds a human element and emotional context.

I should note the key details: the docking happened 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, it was a two-day chase, and Culbertson was eager to return. His feelings of isolation and frustration after the terrorist attacks are crucial for the moral framing. The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, who will stay until May.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements. I should highlight Culbertson's emotional state as it reflects the human impact of the events post-9/11. Also, the tradition of ringing the bell adds a nice touch of camaraderie and tradition in space.

Let me structure this: start with the docking event, mention the new crew replacing the old one, include Culbertson's feelings, the docking process, and the handover. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll craft the summary accordingly, ensuring all the key points are included and the moral aspect of Culbertson's experience is emphasized.

SUMMARY:  
The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new three-member crew to replace the existing team that had been in orbit since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, following a two-day journey. Space station commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief at Endeavour's arrival, as his four-month mission had left him feeling isolated and frustrated, particularly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, prepared to return home, while the new crew—Russian Yuri Onufrienko, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch—would take over operations until May. Culbertson marked the handover with a traditional ship's bell ring, declaring, "Endeavour arriving," as the shuttle closed in on the station.
