SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been stationed there since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, had eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, which marked his ride home after a four-month stay. Although his time on the station was quiet, Culbertson felt frustrated and isolated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson radioed, "We're ready to see you guys," and later rang the ship's bell to announce the shuttle's arrival. Culbertson and his crewmates will now return home, making way for the new crew, including Russian Yuri Onufrienko, the next commander, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will stay on the station until May.
