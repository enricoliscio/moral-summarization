SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour has successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new three-member crew to replace the existing crew who have been on board since August. The shuttle's arrival marks the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief and eagerness to return home after a quiet but isolating stay, particularly following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, American Carl Walz, and American Daniel Bursch, will take over and remain on board until May. The Endeavour's arrival was marked by a traditional naval ceremony, with Culbertson ringing the ship's bell and announcing "Endeavour arriving" as the shuttle drew closer.
