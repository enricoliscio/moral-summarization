SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to relieve the crew members who had been stationed there since August, including commander Frank Culbertson. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, experienced feelings of isolation and frustration following the terrorist attacks on September 11th while he was in space. He was eager to return home and finally felt relief as Endeavour approached the space station. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will reside on the space station until May. They will replace Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, who will return to Earth aboard Endeavour. The successful docking ended a two-day chase and marked a moment of relief and transition for those involved.
END OF SUMMARY.
