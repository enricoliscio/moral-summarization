SUMMARY: Endeavour brings a fresh crew to the international space station, relieving the previous crew who had been stationed there since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, who had felt isolated and frustrated in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, eagerly awaited the shuttle's arrival. The shuttle docked with the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, marking the end of a two-day chase. Culbertson, along with his crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return to Earth, while the new crew, Yuri Onufrienko, Carl Walz, and Daniel Bursch, will take their place aboard the space station until May. This rotation ensures the continuous presence and contribution to the advancement of human knowledge and exploration in space.

END OF SUMMARY.
