SUMMARY: After a two-day chase, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, providing a new three-man crew to relieve the previous crew, who had been stationed there since August. The outgoing commander, Frank Culbertson, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11th terrorist attacks, a difficult situation exacerbated by his extended stay in space and the small, exclusively male and Russian-dominated crew. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will uphold the moral duty of supporting their colleagues and their country by taking over the space station until May. This story exemplifies the ethical values of courage, duty, and camaraderie in the face of challenging circumstances, be they the terrorist attacks or the challenges of space exploration.

END OF SUMMARY.
