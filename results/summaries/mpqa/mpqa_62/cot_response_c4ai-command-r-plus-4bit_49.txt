*tradition*

SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, providing *relief* to the previous crew who had been stationed there since August. Among them was Navy fighter pilot Frank Culbertson, who expressed feelings of *frustration* and isolation due to the September 11 terrorist attacks. In adherence to *tradition*, Culbertson rang the ship's bell as Endeavour approached, marking the end of his mission and the beginning of a new crew's journey. The fresh three-man crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will inhabit the space station until May. 
END OF SUMMARY.
