Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the word "attacks." The user provided an example response, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read the article carefully. The main points are the Endeavour docking with the ISS, delivering a new crew, and the commander's feelings post-9/11. The key morally framed word here is "attacks," which refers to the September 11 events.

I need to ensure the summary includes "attacks" and maintains the moral context. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow the structure with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning the docking and the new crew. Then, I'll include Culbertson's feelings of isolation and frustration after the attacks. I'll make sure to mention the tradition of ringing the bell and the crew change. Finally, I'll keep the language clear and concise, sticking to the facts while highlighting the moral aspect.

Let me draft this, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points.

SUMMARY:  
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS), delivering a fresh three-member crew to replace the current crew, which has been aboard since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, following a two-day journey. ISS commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed relief at Endeavour's arrival, as his four-month mission had left him feeling isolated and frustrated, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will return to Earth, while the new crew—Russian Yuri Onufrienko, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch—will take their place, staying aboard until May. Culbertson marked the occasion by ringing the ship's bell and announcing, "Endeavour arriving," a tradition rooted in maritime custom.  
END OF SUMMARY.
