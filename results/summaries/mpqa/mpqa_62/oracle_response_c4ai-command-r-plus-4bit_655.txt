SUMMARY: The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to take over from those who had been stationed there since August. This event marked a significant moment in space exploration, providing relief to the previous crew, which included Space Station Commander Frank Culbertson. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, experienced feelings of isolation and frustration following the devastating terrorist attacks on September 11th while aboard the space station. He eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, which offered him a much-anticipated ride back to Earth. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, along with Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, prepared to take their places and continue their mission in space until May. The handover between the crews represented a seamless transition in the ongoing exploration and study of space, with Endeavour's arrival being a welcomed sight for those aboard the space station.

END OF SUMMARY.
