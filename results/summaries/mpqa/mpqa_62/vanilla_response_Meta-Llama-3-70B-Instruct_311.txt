SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station on Friday, bringing a new three-member crew to replace the existing team that has been on board since August. The shuttle arrived after a two-day chase, and Space Station Commander Frank Culbertson, who has been on the station for four months, eagerly awaited his ride home. Culbertson, along with his Russian crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will depart the station today, making way for the new crew consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, who will take over as commander, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch. The new crew will stay on the station until May. Culbertson's stay was marked by feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11 terrorist attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
