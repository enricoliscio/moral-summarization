*eagerly*
*isolation*
*frustration*
*relieve*
SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the International Space Station, bringing a fresh three-man crew to *relieve* the current crew, who have been in space since August. The arrival was highly anticipated by the current commander, Frank Culbertson, who expressed feelings of *isolation* and *frustration* during his four-month stay, especially after the September 11th terrorist attacks. He was joined by two Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson *eagerly* welcomed the shuttle, ringing the ship's bell in a traditional manner. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take their places and remain aboard the space station until May. 
END OF SUMMARY.
