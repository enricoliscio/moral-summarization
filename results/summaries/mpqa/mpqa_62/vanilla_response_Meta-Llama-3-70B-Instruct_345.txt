SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour has successfully docked with the international space station, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew who have been on board since August. The shuttle arrived after a two-day chase, and the space station commander Frank Culbertson, who has been on board for four months, eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, which will take him home. Culbertson, along with his Russian crewmates, will depart the space station today, making way for the new crew consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will stay on board until May. The new crew will take over the operations of the space station, marking a new phase in the ongoing space mission.

END OF SUMMARY.
