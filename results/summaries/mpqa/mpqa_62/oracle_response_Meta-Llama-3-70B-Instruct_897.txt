SUMMARY: 

Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who have been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for space station commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, eagerly awaited his ride home, and he radioed "We're ready to see you guys" as Endeavour approached. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, American Carl Walz, and American Daniel Bursch, will stay on board until May. The successful docking and crew exchange bring a sense of relief and hope, a welcome respite from the fear and uncertainty that followed the devastating attacks.
