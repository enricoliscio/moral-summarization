SUMMARY: The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the previous crew, who had been stationed there since August. Among those returning to Earth was Space Station Commander Frank Culbertson, who experienced feelings of isolation and frustration following the terrorist attacks on September 11th while stationed in space with his two Russian crewmates. Culbertson eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, which would bring him back to Earth. He expressed his excitement as the shuttle approached, and once it was within 40 feet, he rang the ship's bell and announced, "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his crewmates will be relieved by the new crew, who will remain aboard the space station until May.

END OF SUMMARY.
