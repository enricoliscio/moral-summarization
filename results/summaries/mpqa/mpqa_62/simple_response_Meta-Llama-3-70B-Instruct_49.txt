SUMMARY:

In a moment of relief and reunion, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to replace the team that has been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the September 11 terrorist attacks. As the shuttle approached, Culbertson radioed his excitement, and as it drew closer, he rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving" in a nod to the tradition of the high seas. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties until May. The successful docking and crew exchange is a testament to the power of international cooperation and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.
