SUMMARY:

Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the existing team that has been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, was eager to return home and welcomed the arrival of Endeavour, saying "We're ready to see you guys" as the shuttle drew closer. As the spacecraft docked, Culbertson rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving" in a nod to the tradition of the high seas. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties on the space station until May.
