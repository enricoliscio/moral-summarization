SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the crew that had been stationed there since August. The shuttle approached the space station, orbiting 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, and was greeted by the current space station commander, Frank Culbertson, who expressed his eagerness to return to Earth after feeling isolated and frustrated following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson and his crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will be relieved by Russian Yuri Onufrienko, who will take over as commander, along with Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who are scheduled to remain on the space station until May.

END OF SUMMARY.
