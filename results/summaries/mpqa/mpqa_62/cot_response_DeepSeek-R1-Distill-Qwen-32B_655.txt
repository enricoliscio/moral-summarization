Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "delivered," "relieve," "awaited," "quiet," "isolated," "frustrated," "attacks," "ghostly," "tradition," "closed," "commander," "crewmates," "move," "places," "stay," "until." These words seem to carry some moral weight in the context.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the docking of Endeavour, the delivery of the new crew, and the relief of the existing crew. I'll note Culbertson's feelings after the attacks, the arrival of the new crew, and the transfer of command.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step: docking, new crew arrival, Culbertson's emotions, the transfer process, and the new crew's stay until May.

Now, I'll put it all together, making sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200.

Finally, I'll present the summary after the specified tokens. I think that covers everything the user asked for.

**SUMMARY:**  
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew that had been onboard since August. The docking occurred 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day pursuit. Station commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11 attacks. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson radioed his readiness to see the crew, observing the shuttle as it closed in. In a traditional maritime gesture, he rang the ship's bell and announced, "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will depart today, making way for the new crew led by Russian commander Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will remain aboard until May.
