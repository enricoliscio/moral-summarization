Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the space shuttle Endeavour docking with the International Space Station (ISS). It delivered a new crew to relieve the existing three astronauts who have been up there since August. The docking happened 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border after a two-day journey. 

Commander Frank Culbertson was waiting for Endeavour to bring him home. He mentioned feeling isolated and frustrated after the September 11 attacks, which adds a human element and emotional context. His crewmates were two Russians, which highlights international cooperation. 

When Endeavour was close, Culbertson radioed to the shuttle crew, watched the approach, rang the ship's bell, and announced the arrival in a traditional manner. This shows the ceremonial aspect and the camaraderie among astronauts. 

The outgoing crew will leave today, and the new crew, consisting of a Russian and two Americans, will take over until May. This emphasizes the ongoing international collaboration in space missions.

I need to capture the key points: docking, crew relief, emotional impact of 9/11, international teamwork, and the ceremonial aspects. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral elements like the human experience and international cooperation.

Let me structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.
