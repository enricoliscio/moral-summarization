SUMMARY: Endeavour brings justice to Culbertson, Dezhurov and Tyurin, who were isolated in space and frustrated by their inability to help in the face of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Endeavour, shining like a beacon of hope, chased down the space station and offered a way home for the tired crew. The new team, led by Yuri Onufrienko, will take their place and continue the mission until May. The transfer of power, a symbol of the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity, was marked by Culbertson's ringing of the ship's bell in a nod to maritime tradition. Endeavour's arrival, a testament to human resilience and our unyielding pursuit of exploration, brings relief and a chance for new beginnings.
