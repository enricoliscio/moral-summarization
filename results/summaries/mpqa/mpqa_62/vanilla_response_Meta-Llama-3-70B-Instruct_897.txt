SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour has successfully docked with the international space station, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the existing crew who have been on board since August. The shuttle, carrying Russian Yuri Onufrienko, Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, pulled up to the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border after a two-day chase. Outgoing space station commander Frank Culbertson, who has been on board for four months, expressed relief and excitement at the arrival of Endeavour, which will take him and his crewmates back to Earth. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, described feeling isolated and frustrated after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The new crew will stay on board the space station until May.
