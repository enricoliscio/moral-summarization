SUMMARY:
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who have been on board since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, had eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, his ride home after a four-month stay. Although his stay was quiet, Culbertson felt isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As Endeavour pulled within 1 1/2 miles, Culbertson radioed "We're ready to see you guys." The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko, Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over the space station until May. Culbertson and his crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will finally return home, ending their prolonged stay in space. END OF SUMMARY.
