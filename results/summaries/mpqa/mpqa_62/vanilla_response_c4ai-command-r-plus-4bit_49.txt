SUMMARY: Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a fresh three-man crew to replace the crew that had been stationed there since August. The shuttle approached the space station 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day journey. Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been on the station for four months, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, which would take him home. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, were replaced by Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will remain on the station until May. The new crew will conduct spacewalks and perform maintenance on the space station during their stay.
