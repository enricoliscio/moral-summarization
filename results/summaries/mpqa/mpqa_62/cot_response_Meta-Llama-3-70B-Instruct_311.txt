SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been on board since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, had eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, his ride home after a four-month stay. Although his stay was quiet, he felt isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As Endeavour approached, Culbertson radioed, "We're ready to see you guys." He then rang the ship's bell and announced, "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his crewmates will depart, making way for the new crew, including Russian Yuri Onufrienko, the next commander, and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, who will stay on board until May.
