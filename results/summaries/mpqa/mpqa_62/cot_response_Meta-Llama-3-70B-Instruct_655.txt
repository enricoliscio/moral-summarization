SUMMARY:
Space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who had been on board since August. Commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, his ride home. As the shuttle drew closer, Culbertson radioed, "We're ready to see you guys," and later rang the ship's bell, announcing, "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his crewmates will move out of the space station, making way for the new crew, who will stay aboard until May. The quiet four-month stay of the previous crew came to an end, marking a new chapter for the space station. END OF SUMMARY.
