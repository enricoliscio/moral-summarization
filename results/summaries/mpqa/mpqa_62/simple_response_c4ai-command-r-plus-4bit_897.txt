SUMMARY: Relief and joy came for space station commander Frank Culbertson as the space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station. Culbertson, who had been stationed in space since August, expressed feelings of isolation and frustration in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, as he was unable to return home or actively contribute to the response. The shuttle, carrying a fresh three-man crew, ended its two-day chase and docked with the space station, providing a much-needed change of personnel. Culbertson, along with his Russian crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will finally return to Earth, while the new crew, led by Russian Yuri Onufrienko and accompanied by Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take their place aboard the station until May. The successful docking and crew transfer is a testament to the resilience and determination of those involved in the space program, even in the face of challenging circumstances.
END OF SUMMARY.
