Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Endeavour space shuttle docking with the International Space Station. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Endeavour docked with the ISS, delivering a new three-man crew. The mission is to relieve the current crew who have been there since August. The docking happened 250 miles above the Polish-Ukrainian border after a two-day chase. 

The commander of the ISS, Frank Culbertson, is waiting to return home. He mentions feeling isolated and frustrated after the September 11 attacks. His crew includes two Russians, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin. 

When Endeavour is within 1.5 miles, Culbertson radios them, watching the shuttle approach. As it gets closer, he rings the bell and announces in a traditional manner. The current crew will leave today, and the new crew, including Yuri Onufrienko as the new commander and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will stay until May.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main events: docking, new crew arrival, the current crew's departure, and the impact of the September 11 attacks on Culbertson. Also, the traditional announcement upon docking is a nice touch to include.

Let me structure it: Start with the docking event, mention the new crew, the current crew's feelings, and their departure. Then note the new crew's arrival and their stay duration. Keep it concise and include all key points without unnecessary details.

I should also ensure the summary flows well and is clear. Maybe start with the docking, then the arrival of the new crew, mention Culbertson's feelings, the departure, and the new commander.

Let me check the word count as I go. Make sure it's under 200 words. I think that's manageable.

So, putting it all together, the summary should cover the docking, new crew, current crew's emotions, their departure, and the new mission details.
