SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Endeavour successfully docked with the international space station, bringing a fresh three-member crew to relieve the men who have been on board since August. The arrival marked the end of a four-month stay for space station commander Frank Culbertson, who had been feeling isolated and frustrated since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Culbertson, a retired Navy fighter pilot, was eager to return home and was relieved to see the Endeavour approaching. As the shuttle drew closer, Culbertson rang the ship's bell and announced "Endeavour arriving" in the tradition of the high seas. The new crew, consisting of Russian Yuri Onufrienko and Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch, will take over duties on the space station until May.
