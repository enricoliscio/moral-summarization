SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia's involvement in the protocol has been questionable since US President George Bush stated that ratifying it would harm the US economy. Despite the Australian Government's denial, critics argue that the country is aligning with the US, a nation that wants to discard the protocol. David Kemp's spokeswoman affirms the government's commitment to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, urges Australia to refrain from following the US position. Blair reaffirms his concern about greenhouse gases and the potential inadequacy of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing the growing issue of climate change. Blair's statement underscores the moral responsibility of individual countries to address climate change and take a stance on the protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
