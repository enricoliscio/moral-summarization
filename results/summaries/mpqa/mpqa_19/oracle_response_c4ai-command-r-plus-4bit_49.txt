SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his disapproval of Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the Australian government denies that the deal signals a departure from Kyoto, the fact that they are aligning with the US, a country that has explicitly rejected the protocol, raises concerns. David Kemp's spokeswoman affirms their commitment to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, warns against following the US position. Mr. Blair himself acknowledges the disagreement with the US and Australia on this issue and expresses his increasing concern about climate change, even questioning whether the Kyoto Protocol is sufficient to address the scale of the problem. END OF SUMMARY.
