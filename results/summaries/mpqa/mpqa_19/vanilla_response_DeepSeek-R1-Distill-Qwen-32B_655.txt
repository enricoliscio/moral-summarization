Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Tony Blair not being happy with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. 

So, the main points are: Blair disagrees with Australia's move, Australia says it's not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, the partnership involves collaboration between US and Australia on climate issues, critics think Australia is aligning with the US who opposes Kyoto, the future of Kyoto is uncertain and will be decided in Johannesburg, the Environment Minister is still committed to Kyoto, the opposition says Australia shouldn't follow the US, Blair mentions the US's stance on greenhouse gases and that he's concerned about the issue.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include Blair's disagreement, Australia's stance on Kyoto, the partnership details, critics' views, the upcoming decision on Kyoto, and Blair's personal concerns.

Let me structure it: Start with Blair's disagreement, mention Australia's partnership with the US, note the criticism, mention the upcoming meeting, Australia's commitment to Kyoto, and Blair's comments on the issue.

I should keep it concise and ensure all key points are covered without going over the word limit. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

Let me draft it: Blair disagrees with Australia's climate deal with the US, which critics see as moving away from Kyoto. Australia says they're still committed to Kyoto, but are collaborating with the US on climate action. The future of Kyoto is uncertain, to be decided in Johannesburg. Blair is concerned about the issue and thinks the US's stance is problematic.

Wait, I need to make sure it's all in one sentence or a few sentences without being too choppy. Let me try to combine these points smoothly.

Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate deal with the US, which critics view as distancing from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims the partnership doesn't abandon Kyoto, but focuses on collaboration. The protocol's future is undecided ahead of the Johannesburg meeting. Blair is personally concerned about climate change and questions the US's stance.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me check the word count. It should be under 200 words. I think this captures all the necessary information succinctly.
