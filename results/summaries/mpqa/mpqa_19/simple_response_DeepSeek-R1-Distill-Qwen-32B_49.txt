Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate deal with the US. Australia's government claims they're not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics think they're aligning with the US, which wants to dump Kyoto. The US under Bush opposed Kyoto, saying it would hurt their economy. Australia's Environment Minister is still committed to Kyoto and is meeting with the EU. Blair is critical, saying the US and Australia are in disagreement on this issue. He's concerned about climate change and thinks Kyoto might not go far enough.

I need to capture the key points: Blair's disagreement, Australia's stance, the criticism, the US's role, the Kyoto Protocol's future, and Blair's personal concern. Also, maintain the moral perspective, highlighting the conflict between countries on climate action and the criticism of Australia's alignment with the US.

I should structure the summary to first state Blair's disagreement, then explain Australia's position and the criticism, mention the US's role, and conclude with Blair's concerns and the protocol's future. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft it:

Blair criticizes Australia's climate deal with the US, disagreeing with their approach. Australia claims it's not abandoning Kyoto but critics argue they're aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto. The US's Bush administration rejected Kyoto, citing economic harm. Australia's Environment Minister remains committed to Kyoto and is meeting the EU. Blair expresses concern over climate change, doubting Kyoto's adequacy. The future of Kyoto is at stake in Johannesburg.

That's concise and covers all the moral aspects. Let me check the word count. It's around 100 words, so I can add a bit more detail if needed.

Maybe add that the partnership involves governments, businesses, and research. Also, Blair's statement about individual countries deciding their positions. And the criticism that Australia is sending mixed signals by not fully supporting Kyoto while partnering with the US.

Okay, let me refine it:

Blair criticizes Australia's decision to sign a climate deal with the US, disagreeing with their approach. Australia claims it's not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics argue it's aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto. The partnership involves governments, businesses, and research. Blair is concerned about climate change, doubting Kyoto's adequacy. Australia's Environment Minister remains committed to Kyoto and is meeting the EU. The future of the protocol is at stake in Johannesburg, highlighting the conflict between countries on climate action.

That's better, around 120 words. I think this captures the moral framing by showing the conflict and criticism of Australia's stance.

Australia's government insists the partnership, which involves collaboration between governments, businesses, and research bodies, does not signal a departure from Kyoto. However, critics argue that by aligning with the U.S., which opposes the protocol, Australia is sending mixed signals. The future of the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets to reduce greenhouse gases, will be discussed at a meeting in Johannesburg. Australia's Environment Minister remains committed to Kyoto and is meeting with the European Union. Blair emphasized his concern over climate change, suggesting the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough. END OF SUMMARY.
