SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expresses disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol. Blair asserts that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement between the UK and the US, and he questions the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing the pressing issue of climate change. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked controversy as Australia's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol comes into question, especially with the US's intention to abandon the protocol. Despite assurances from the Australian government, critics argue that the partnership sends a conflicting message. Blair emphasizes the importance of individual countries stating their positions on climate change, reflecting a moral responsibility to address this global issue. Blair's concerns align with the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, who urges Australia to maintain its commitment to addressing climate change and avoid following the US's position. The future of the Kyoto Protocol hangs in the balance as international discussions continue. END OF SUMMARY.
