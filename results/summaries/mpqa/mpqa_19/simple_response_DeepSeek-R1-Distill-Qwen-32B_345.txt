Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate deal with the US, which seems to be moving away from the Kyoto Protocol. 

First, I need to understand the key points. Blair is unhappy because Australia is aligning with the US, which doesn't support Kyoto. The article mentions that critics are pointing out Australia's conflicting stanceâ€”saying they're not abandoning Kyoto but partnering with the US, which wants to dump it. 

I should highlight the moral aspect here. The moral framing likely revolves around the responsibility to combat climate change and the potential consequences of not adhering to international agreements like Kyoto. Blair's concern about the protocol not going far enough adds to the moral weight, emphasizing the urgency of the issue.

I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict between Australia and the US versus the rest of the international community, especially Europe. Also, including Blair's personal stance and the implications for the Kyoto Protocol's future is important.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure that the moral implications are clear. Maybe start by stating Blair's disagreement, then outline Australia's position and the criticism, followed by Blair's concerns and the broader implications for climate change efforts.

Let me structure it: introduce Blair's disagreement, explain Australia's partnership with the US, mention the criticism about Kyoto, Blair's doubts about Kyoto's adequacy, and the future decision point in Johannesburg. Also, include the opposing views from Australia's government and opposition.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward, focusing on the moral dilemma of prioritizing economic interests over environmental commitments. Make sure to highlight the tension between national economic concerns and global environmental responsibilities.

Finally, I'll craft a summary that flows logically, ensuring each sentence builds on the previous one, maintaining the moral perspective throughout.

SUMMARY:  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed dissatisfaction with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, which critics view as a move away from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims it remains committed to Kyoto, but its partnership with the US, which opposes the protocol, raises concerns about its true stance. Blair highlighted the moral responsibility to address climate change, stating that while countries have the right to set their own positions, the Kyoto Protocol's targets may not be sufficient. The future of the protocol, aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, will be decided at an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. Australia's Environment Minister, David Kemp, is engaging with the EU, while the opposition accuses the government of aligning too closely with the US on climate issues. Blair emphasized his growing concern over climate change, underscoring the urgency of global action.  
END OF SUMMARY.
