SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia's commitment to the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution by setting targets for countries, is now in question. While the Federal Government denies that the deal signals a departure from Kyoto, critics argue that cosying up to the US, a country that wants to dump the protocol, sends the wrong message. Blair reinforced the importance of countries taking a stand on greenhouse gas emissions, stating that the more he reads about climate change, the more concerned he becomes. He even questioned whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough in addressing this pressing issue. David Kemp's spokeswoman reaffirmed the government's commitment to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, warned against following the US position on climate change. This disagreement highlights the ethical dilemma between economic interests and the responsibility to address climate change, with Blair taking a stand for stronger action to protect the environment.
