Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. The author uses words like "disagree," "dumping," "cosying up," "critics," and "should not follow." These terms carry moral weight, indicating disapproval or criticism.

First, I'll identify the main points: Blair is unhappy with Australia's move, Australia claims they're not abandoning Kyoto, the partnership with the US is seen as conflicting, and there are concerns about the protocol's future.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words. I'll start by stating Blair's disagreement, then mention Australia's denial of abandoning Kyoto. I'll note the critics' view that Australia is aligning with the US, who oppose Kyoto. Then, I'll include Blair's personal concern about the issue and his belief that the Kyoto Protocol might not go far enough.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll also end with the note that the future of Kyoto is undecided, tying back to the moral implications of the decision.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each moral element is included without making the summary too lengthy. I'll check for clarity and that all key points are covered while preserving the author's tone.

SUMMARY:  
Tony Blair expressed dissatisfaction with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, criticizing the move as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia denied this, stating its commitment to Kyoto while also pursuing a "climate action partnership" with the US. Critics argue that Australia is "cosying up" to the US, which opposes Kyoto, creating a moral dilemma. Blair emphasized his concerns about greenhouse gases, acknowledging a "disagreement" with the US and Australia, while also questioning whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough. The future of the protocol, aimed at reducing pollution, remains undecided ahead of a meeting in Johannesburg. Australia's Environment Minister reaffirmed the country's commitment to Kyoto, while the Opposition urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. Blair's remarks highlight the moral and political tensions surrounding global climate efforts.
