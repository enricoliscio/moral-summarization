SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked controversy as Australia claims to still support Kyoto while aligning with the US, which opposes it. The future of the protocol, aimed at reducing pollution through global targets, hangs in the balance ahead of a key meeting in Johannesburg. A spokeswoman for Australia's Environment Minister David Kemp reaffirmed the country's commitment to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, urged Australia to distance itself from the US position. Blair acknowledged the disagreement with the US and Australia, expressing concern about the growing urgency of the climate change issue and questioning the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol.
