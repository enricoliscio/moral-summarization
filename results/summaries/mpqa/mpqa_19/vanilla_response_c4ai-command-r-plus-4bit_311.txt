SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, while the Federal Government denied that the agreement signaled a departure from the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has been criticized for Australia's apparent alignment with the US position on Kyoto. The future of the protocol, which sets targets for pollution reduction, will be decided at an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. Despite assurances from the Environment Minister's spokeswoman, critics argue that Australia's involvement in the partnership contradicts its stated commitment to Kyoto. Mr. Blair emphasized his concern about climate change and disagreed with both the US and Australia's stance on the issue, urging countries to state their positions clearly. He also questioned the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol, suggesting that more ambitious action may be needed. END OF SUMMARY.
