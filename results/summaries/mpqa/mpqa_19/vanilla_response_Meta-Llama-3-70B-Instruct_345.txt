SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" involves collaboration on climate change, but critics argue that it signals Australia's intention to abandon the Kyoto Protocol. Australia has been uncertain about its involvement in Kyoto since the US announced it would not ratify the protocol, citing economic concerns. The future of the protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. Blair stated that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement with the US and, by implication, Australia. He also expressed concerns that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change. The Australian government has denied that the deal signals a shift away from Kyoto, and the Environment Minister is committed to the protocol. The Opposition has urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change.
