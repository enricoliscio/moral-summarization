Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Tony Blair disagreeing with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. Australia claims it's not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics argue it's aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto. The US's stance is that Kyoto would harm their economy. Australia's government says they're still committed to Kyoto but are collaborating with the US on climate issues. Blair is concerned about the effectiveness of Kyoto and thinks more action is needed.

I should highlight the conflict between Australia and the US regarding Kyoto, Blair's criticism, and the moral implications of aligning with the US against Kyoto. Also, mention Blair's doubt about Kyoto's adequacy and his concern for the environment.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Blair's disagreement, Australia's stance, the criticism, and Blair's views on Kyoto and climate change.

Let me structure this clearly, ensuring the moral aspects are emphasized, like Australia's potential shift and Blair's environmental concerns.

SUMMARY:  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has criticized Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, expressing concern over its implications for the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims the agreement does not signal a departure from Kyoto, but critics argue it aligns the country with the US, which opposes the protocol. The US under George Bush argued that ratifying Kyoto would harm its economy. Australia's Environment Minister, David Kemp, reaffirmed the country's commitment to Kyoto while traveling to Brussels for talks with the EU after visiting Washington. Opposition spokesman Kelvin Thomson urged Australia not to follow the US stance on climate change. Blair stated that greenhouse gases are an area of clear disagreement with the US and Australia, emphasizing that each country must decide its position. However, he questioned whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough and expressed growing concern about climate change.
