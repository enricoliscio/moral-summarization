SUMMARY:

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, which critics argue is a move away from the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" involves cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change, but Blair believes it may undermine the Kyoto Protocol's targets for reducing pollution. Australia's commitment to Kyoto has been in doubt since the US announced it would not ratify the protocol, citing economic concerns. Blair's concerns highlight the moral obligation of individual countries to take a strong stance on climate change, rather than following the lead of others. He emphasizes that climate change is a pressing issue that requires bold action, and that the Kyoto Protocol may not even go far enough in addressing the problem. Blair's words serve as a call to action for countries to prioritize the health of the planet over economic interests.
