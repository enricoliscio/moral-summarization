SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked controversy as Australia maintains its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol while aligning with the US, which has rejected it. The protocol aims to reduce pollution by setting targets for countries, and its future will be decided at an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. Despite criticism, the Australian government asserts its continued support for the protocol, with Environment Minister David Kemp's spokeswoman confirming his commitment. Opposition environment spokesman Kelvin Thomson also emphasized Australia's need to maintain its stance on climate change. Blair acknowledged the disagreement with the US and Australia, expressing concern over the increasing urgency of the climate change issue. He also questioned the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing the problem. END OF SUMMARY.
