SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disappointment and concern over Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a signal that Australia is "dumping" the Kyoto Protocol. Blair emphasized that greenhouse gases are an area of "obvious disagreement" with the US, and by extension, with Australia. He urged individual countries to take a stance on the issue, implying that Australia should not simply follow the US position. Blair also expressed reservations about the Kyoto Protocol, suggesting that it may not go far enough in addressing climate change. The Australian government, on the other hand, claims that it remains committed to Kyoto, despite its new partnership with the US. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, echoed Blair's sentiments, arguing that Australia should not follow the US lead on climate change. The future of the Kyoto Protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg later this year.
