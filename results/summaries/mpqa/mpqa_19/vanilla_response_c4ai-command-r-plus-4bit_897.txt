SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, known as the "climate action partnership." The deal involves liaison between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change, but critics argue that it undermines the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Australia's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol has been uncertain since US President George Bush indicated that ratifying the protocol could harm the US economy. A spokeswoman for the Australian Environment Minister asserted that the government remains committed to the protocol, but the Opposition's environment spokesman urged Australia to distance itself from the US position on climate change. Blair acknowledged the disagreement with the US and Australia, stating that countries should determine their own positions. He also expressed concern about the potential impact of climate change.
