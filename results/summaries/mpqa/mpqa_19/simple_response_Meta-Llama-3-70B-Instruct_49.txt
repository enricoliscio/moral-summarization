SUMMARY:

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a step away from the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate collaboration on climate change, but Blair believes individual countries should take a stance on the issue. He is concerned that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change. The Australian government has denied abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, despite the US's reluctance to ratify it. The future of the protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. Blair's stance highlights the moral imperative for countries to take a strong position on climate change, rather than following the lead of others. His concerns about the severity of climate change underscore the need for collective action to mitigate its effects.
