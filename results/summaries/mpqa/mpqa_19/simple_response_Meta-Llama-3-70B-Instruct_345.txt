SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a step away from the Kyoto Protocol. Blair believes that individual countries should take a stance on climate change, implying that Australia's move is a mistake. The Australian government claims it is still committed to Kyoto, but its involvement in the protocol has been in doubt since the US announced it would not ratify it. The future of Kyoto will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. Blair's concerns about climate change are growing, and he questions whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough in addressing the issue.
