SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his concern about climate change, disagreeing with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. He is unhappy with the move, which he believes is a step towards dumping the Kyoto Protocol. Blair thinks that the protocol, which sets targets to cut pollution, does not go far enough. Australia's involvement in Kyoto has been in doubt since the US President George Bush announced that ratifying the protocol would hurt the US economy. Critics argue that Australia is cosying up to the US, which wants to dump Kyoto, while claiming to be committed to the protocol. The future of the protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. Blair urged individual countries to state their own position on climate change, emphasizing that it is an area of obvious disagreement with the US and Australia. END OF SUMMARY.
