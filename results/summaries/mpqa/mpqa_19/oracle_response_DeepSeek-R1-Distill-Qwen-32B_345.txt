Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. Australia's government claims they're not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics think they're moving away from it by aligning with the US. The US, under Bush, didn't ratify Kyoto, saying it would harm their economy. The future of Kyoto is up for decision in Johannesburg. Australia's Environment Minister is still committed to Kyoto, but the opposition thinks Australia shouldn't follow the US on climate change. Blair mentions that greenhouse gases are a point of disagreement with the US and implies Kyoto might not go far enough.

Now, the author used morally framed words like "disagree," "dumping," "cosying up," "hurt," "committed," "should not follow," "concerned," and "not far enough." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral perspective.

I should structure the summary to include Blair's disagreement, Australia's partnership with the US, the criticism about Kyoto, the US's stance, the upcoming decision, Australia's commitment, the opposition's view, Blair's comments on the US, and his concern about Kyoto's adequacy.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the key points with the moral language preserved.

SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, criticizing the move as it appeared to signal a departure from the Kyoto Protocol. Critics argue that while Australia claims not to be "dumping" Kyoto, its "cosying up" to the US, which opposes the protocol, undermines its commitment. The US, under President George Bush, has argued that ratifying Kyoto would "hurt" the economy. The protocol's future will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg, with Australia's Environment Minister still "committed" to it, though the opposition urges Australia not to "follow the US position." Blair emphasized the moral responsibility to address greenhouse gases, stating his growing concern about the issue and questioning whether Kyoto goes far enough. END OF SUMMARY.
