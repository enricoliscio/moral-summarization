SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed his disapproval of Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a signal that Australia is "dumping" the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. However, Blair and other critics argue that Australia is being "disingenuous" by claiming to support Kyoto while simultaneously "cosying up‚Äù to the US, which has explicitly stated its intention to abandon the protocol. The future of the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets for reducing pollution, hangs in the balance and will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg later this year. Blair has emphasized the importance of individual countries taking a strong stance on climate change, expressing his own growing concern about the issue.
