SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, which he believes is a step in the wrong direction. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has been criticized for being a signal that Australia is dumping the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets to cut pollution. Blair is concerned about climate change, and the more he reads about it, the more he becomes concerned. He thinks individual countries should state their own position on the issue. Australia's Environment Minister, David Kemp, claims that the Government is still committed to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, argues that Australia should not follow the US position on climate change. The future of the Kyoto Protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. END OF SUMMARY.
