SUMMARY:

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, citing "obvious disagreement" on the issue of greenhouse gases. Critics argue that Australia is being hypocritical by claiming to support the Kyoto Protocol while simultaneously "cosying up" to the US, which has explicitly stated its intention to "dump" the protocol. The Australian government has denied this, claiming it remains committed to Kyoto. However, Opposition environment spokesman Kelvin Thomson has urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. Blair has emphasized the gravity of the issue, stating that "the more I read about climate change, the more concerned I become about this issue." His comments suggest that he believes individual countries must take responsibility for their own stance on the issue, rather than simply following the US lead.
