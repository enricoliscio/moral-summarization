SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair publicly expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, highlighting an obvious moral dilemma. Australia's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions is now in doubt as it cozies up to the US, a country that wants to abandon Kyoto. Critics argue that Australia is sending mixed signals by claiming to support Kyoto while also aligning with the US, a country that believes ratifying the protocol would harm its economy. The future of the protocol, which sets pollution reduction targets for countries, hangs in the balance and will be determined at an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. Blair's concerns about climate change and his disagreement with both the US and Australia's approach underscore the moral urgency of this global issue. Australia's environment minister asserts the government's continued commitment to Kyoto, but the opposition's environment spokesman cautions against following the US position. The moral complexity of this issue is evident in Blair's concern that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough to address the pressing challenges of climate change. This news highlights the ethical dimensions of global environmental policy and the need for countries to carefully consider their positions. END OF SUMMARY.
