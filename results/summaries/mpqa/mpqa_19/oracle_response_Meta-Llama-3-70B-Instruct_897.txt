SUMMARY:

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics say is a signal that Australia is "dumping" the Kyoto Protocol. Blair's concerns are rooted in the fact that the US has announced its intention to abandon the protocol, which sets targets for countries to cut pollution. The Australian government, however, claims it is still committed to Kyoto. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, has also spoken out against following the US position on climate change. Blair's remarks highlight the "obvious disagreement" between the US and UK on this issue, and he has even questioned whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough in addressing the pressing concern of climate change. His words convey a sense of urgency and concern, emphasizing that individual countries must take a stand on this critical issue.
