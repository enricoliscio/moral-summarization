SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his concern about climate change, stating that the more he reads about it, the more concerned he becomes. He disagreed with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, which critics argue is a signal that Australia is dumping the Kyoto Protocol. Blair emphasized that individual countries should state their own position on the issue. The Australian Government denied this, claiming it is still committed to the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets for countries to cut pollution. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, agreed with Blair, saying Australia should not follow the US position on climate change. The future of the Kyoto Protocol will be decided this year at a meeting in Johannesburg. Blair's disagreement with the US and Australia on this issue is obvious, and he believes the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
