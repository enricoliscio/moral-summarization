SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a step away from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims it remains committed to Kyoto, but its involvement has been in doubt since the US announced it would not ratify the protocol. The UK and Australia have differing stances on climate change, with Blair emphasizing the importance of addressing greenhouse gases. He believes individual countries must take their own stance on the issue, implying that Australia should not follow the US position. Blair also expressed concerns that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change. The future of the protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year.
