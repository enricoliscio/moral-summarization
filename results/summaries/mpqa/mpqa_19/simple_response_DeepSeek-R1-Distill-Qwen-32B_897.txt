Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down. The article is about Tony Blair disagreeing with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. The key points are Blair's criticism, Australia's stance on Kyoto, and the broader implications of the US's position on the protocol.

First, I need to identify the main elements: who, what, when, where, why. The who is Tony Blair, the British PM. The what is his disagreement with Australia's deal with the US. The when is yesterday, the where is in the context of international climate agreements, and the why is because it might undermine the Kyoto Protocol.

Next, I should note the moral framing. The article presents the US's stance as problematic because they want to dump Kyoto, which is seen as a responsible international agreement. Australia is criticized for aligning with the US, which could signal a move away from Kyoto, despite their claims of commitment. Blair's concern is about the effectiveness of Kyoto and the potential negative impact on global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.

I need to ensure the summary captures this tension. It should mention Blair's criticism, Australia's partnership with the US, the criticism that this undermines Kyoto, and Blair's doubt about Kyoto's adequacy. Also, include the upcoming meeting in Johannesburg where Kyoto's future will be decided.

I should structure the summary to first state Blair's disagreement, then explain the nature of the Australia-US deal, the critics' perspective, Blair's personal doubts about Kyoto, and the political context with the EU and the upcoming meeting.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive. Also, the summary needs to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start after "SUMMARY: ".

Let me make sure I include all critical points without getting too detailed. Avoid jargon, keep it clear and straightforward. The moral aspect is clear: supporting Kyoto is seen as responsible, while opposing it is criticized. So the summary should reflect that the US and Australia's actions are seen negatively in that context.

I think I've covered all the necessary elements. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing as per the original article.

SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair has criticized Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, expressing concern over its potential impact on the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" focuses on collaboration between governments, businesses, and researchers, but critics argue it signals Australia's alignment with the US, which opposes the Kyoto Protocol. Australia has maintained its commitment to Kyoto, with Environment Minister David Kemp set to discuss the matter with the European Union. Blair, while acknowledging disagreements with the US on climate change, emphasized the importance of individual countries stating their positions. He also expressed doubts about whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The future of the protocol will be decided at an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. END OF SUMMARY.
