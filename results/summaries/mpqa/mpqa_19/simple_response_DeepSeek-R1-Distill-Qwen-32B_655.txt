Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's climate deal. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the stances of the involved parties.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Tony Blair criticizing Australia for signing a climate deal with the US, which critics see as moving away from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia claims they're still committed to Kyoto, but their partnership with the US, which opposes Kyoto, raises doubts.

I should highlight the moral aspects, like the conflict between international cooperation (Kyoto) and aligning with the US, which is seen as not taking climate change seriously. Also, Blair's concern about the effectiveness of Kyoto and his push for stronger action is a key point.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main elements: Blair's criticism, Australia's stance, the partnership details, critics' views, and Blair's personal concerns about climate change.

Let me structure it: start with Blair's criticism, mention Australia's partnership with the US, note the critics' perspective, Australia's denial of abandoning Kyoto, Blair's doubts about Kyoto's sufficiency, and his call for countries to take action.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, maintaining the moral framing throughout.

SUMMARY:  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, criticizing the move as inconsistent with global efforts to combat climate change. Australia's partnership with the US, which opposes the Kyoto Protocol, has drawn criticism, as it appears to signal a shift away from the international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Australia's government insists it remains committed to Kyoto, but its alignment with the US, which withdrew from the protocol, has raised concerns. Blair emphasized the importance of addressing climate change, stating that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough, and called for stronger global action. Critics argue that Australia's stance risks undermining international cooperation on this critical issue.
