SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue is a signal that Australia is "dumping" the Kyoto Protocol. Blair's concerns are rooted in the fact that the US has announced its intention to abandon the protocol, which sets targets to cut pollution. The Australian government has denied this, claiming it is still committed to Kyoto. However, the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, has urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. Blair has emphasized that individual countries must take a stance on this critical issue, and has expressed doubts about whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough. His concerns are rooted in the severity of the climate change issue, which he believes warrants stronger action.
