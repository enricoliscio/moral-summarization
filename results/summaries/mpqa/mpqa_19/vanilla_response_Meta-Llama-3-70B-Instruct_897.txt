SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics say undermines the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" involves cooperation on climate change, but Blair believes it may signal Australia's departure from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia has denied this, with the Environment Minister reaffirming the country's commitment to Kyoto. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, also urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. Blair expressed concerns about climate change, stating that the more he reads about it, the more concerned he becomes. The future of the Kyoto Protocol will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg later this year.
