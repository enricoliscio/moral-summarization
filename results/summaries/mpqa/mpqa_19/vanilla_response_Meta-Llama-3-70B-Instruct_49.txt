SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which some critics see as a move away from the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. Australia has denied that the agreement signals a departure from Kyoto, but Blair remains skeptical. The future of the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets for reducing pollution, will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg later this year. Blair has stated that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement with the US, and by implication, Australia. He has also expressed concerns that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change.
