SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his concern about climate change, stating that he becomes more concerned the more he reads about it. He disagreed with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, which he believes is a signal that Australia is dumping the Kyoto Protocol. Blair emphasized that individual countries should state their own position on the issue. Australia's Environment Minister, David Kemp, claimed that the Government is still committed to Kyoto, despite critics arguing that the country is cosying up to the US, which wants to dump the protocol. The future of Kyoto will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg this year. Blair's remarks highlighted the obvious disagreement between the UK and the US on greenhouse gases, with Australia's position being uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
