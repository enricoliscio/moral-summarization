Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Tony Blair not being happy with Australia's new green deal. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, disagrees with Australia signing a climate change deal with the US. Australia's government claims this isn't a sign of abandoning the Kyoto Protocol. The partnership involves cooperation between governments, businesses, and research on climate change. Critics are pointing out that Australia is trying to stay with Kyoto but also aligning with the US, which wants to leave Kyoto. 

I remember that George Bush had said that ratifying Kyoto would hurt the US economy, so Australia's commitment to Kyoto has been uncertain. The future of the protocol is to be decided in Johannesburg this year. Australia's Environment Minister, David Kemp, is talking to the EU in Brussels after visiting Washington, and the government still supports Kyoto. The opposition says Australia shouldn't follow the US on climate change. 

Blair mentions that there's a clear disagreement with the US on greenhouse gases and also with Australia. He's not sure Kyoto goes far enough and is increasingly concerned about climate change.

So, the key points are:
- Blair disagrees with Australia's deal with the US on climate change.
- Australia says it's not abandoning Kyoto.
- Critics see it as aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto.
- The protocol's future is in Johannesburg.
- Australia's government still supports Kyoto, but the opposition is against following the US.
- Blair is concerned about the issue and thinks Kyoto might not be enough.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all main points without going into too much detail. I should start with Blair's disagreement, mention Australia's stance, the criticism, the background with the US, the upcoming meeting, the government's commitment, the opposition's view, and Blair's personal concerns.

Let me structure it: Blair disagrees with Australia's deal, Australia says they're not leaving Kyoto, critics think they're aligning with the US who opposes Kyoto, background on Bush's stance, the protocol's decision point, Kemp's talks, government commitment, opposition's stance, Blair's comments on the US and Australia, and his concern about Kyoto's adequacy.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and is concise. Let me check the word count as I write to ensure it's under 200 words.
