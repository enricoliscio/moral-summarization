SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, known as the "climate action partnership." Australia's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, has been called into question as a result. Critics argue that Australia is sending mixed signals by claiming to support Kyoto while also aligning with the US, which has rejected the protocol. A spokesperson for the Australian government insists that they remain committed to the protocol, but the opposition's environment spokesman urges the country to distance itself from the US position. Blair himself acknowledges the disagreement with both the US and Australia, stating that he is increasingly concerned about climate change and the potential inadequacy of the Kyoto Protocol.
