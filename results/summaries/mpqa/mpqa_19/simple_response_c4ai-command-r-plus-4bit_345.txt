SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked controversy as Australia claims to still support Kyoto while aligning with the US, which wants to abandon the protocol. David Kemp's spokeswoman affirmed the government's commitment to Kyoto, but the opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, warned against following the US position. Mr. Blair highlighted his concerns about greenhouse gases and the potential insufficiency of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing the growing issue of climate change. He emphasized that countries should state their own positions, showing disagreement with both the US and Australia's approach. This disagreement highlights the ethical dimensions of climate change, where countries must balance economic interests with the moral responsibility to protect the environment and address a global issue that affects everyone.
