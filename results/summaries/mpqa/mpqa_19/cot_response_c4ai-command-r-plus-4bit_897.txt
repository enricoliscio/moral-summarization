SUMMARY:
The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, publicly expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, an agreement that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US deal, dubbed the "climate action partnership," involves collaboration between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. However, critics point out the contradiction in Australia's stance, as the country simultaneously claims to support Kyoto while aligning with the US, which has made clear its intention to abandon the protocol. Australia's commitment to Kyoto has been questionable since US President George Bush asserted that ratifying the protocol would harm the US economy. The future of the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution through targeted goals for all countries, will be decided in an upcoming meeting in Johannesburg. While a spokeswoman for the Environment Minister, David Kemp, reaffirmed the Australian government's commitment to Kyoto, the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. Blair himself expressed concern about greenhouse gases and disagreed with both the US and Australia's stance on the issue, stating that countries should take their own positions. He also questioned the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol, highlighting the urgency and seriousness of climate change.
