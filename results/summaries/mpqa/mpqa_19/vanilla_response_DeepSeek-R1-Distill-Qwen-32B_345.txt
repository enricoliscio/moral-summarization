Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Tony Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that Blair is unhappy with Australia's new green deal. Australia signed an agreement with the US, and Blair disagrees with that. The Australian government claims this doesn't mean they're abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics are saying it looks like they're moving away from it because the US wants to dump Kyoto.

I should note that the partnership involves governments, businesses, and research bodies. Critics point out the contradiction: Australia says they don't want to leave Kyoto but are aligning with the US, which does want to leave it. The US under Bush opposed Kyoto because they thought it would hurt their economy.

The future of Kyoto is to be decided in Johannesburg this year. Australia's Environment Minister is meeting with the EU and still says they're committed to Kyoto. The opposition in Australia thinks they shouldn't follow the US on this issue. Blair mentions that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement with the US and, yes, with Australia too. He's not sure Kyoto goes far enough and is increasingly concerned about climate change.

So, the key points are:
- Blair disagrees with Australia's deal with the US on climate change.
- Australia claims they're not abandoning Kyoto, but critics see it as moving away.
- The US opposed Kyoto, affecting Australia's stance.
- The protocol's future is undecided, with a meeting coming up.
- Australia's government still supports Kyoto, but the opposition disagrees.
- Blair sees a clear disagreement with the US and Australia on this issue, and he's concerned about the adequacy of Kyoto.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Make sure to include Blair's stance, Australia's position, the US's role, and the implications for Kyoto. Also, mention Blair's concerns about the protocol's effectiveness.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduce Blair's disagreement with Australia's deal.
2. Explain Australia's position and the critics' perspective.
3. Mention the US's role and impact on Australia's stance.
4. Note the upcoming meeting and Australia's commitment to Kyoto.
5. Include Blair's comments on the disagreement and his concerns about Kyoto.

I should keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Avoiding unnecessary details, just the essentials.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.
