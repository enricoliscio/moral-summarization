SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which some critics see as a move away from the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. Australia's involvement in Kyoto has been uncertain since the US announced it would not ratify the protocol, citing economic concerns. The future of Kyoto will be decided at a meeting in Johannesburg later this year. Despite Australia's assurances that it remains committed to Kyoto, Blair has voiced concerns about the country's stance on climate change. He believes that individual countries should take their own positions on the issue, and has expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing climate change.
