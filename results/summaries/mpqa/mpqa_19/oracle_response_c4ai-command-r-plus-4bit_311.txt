SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his disapproval of Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked controversy as it seems to contradict Australia's stated commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing pollution and combating climate change. Despite assurances from the Federal Government that the deal with the US does not signify a departure from Kyoto, critics argue that Australia is aligning itself with a country that wants to abandon the protocol. Mr. Blair reinforced this concern by stating his disagreement with both the US and Australia on their stance towards greenhouse gases, an issue he believes deserves greater attention and action. He asserted that countries should be free to state their positions, but also implied that the Kyoto Protocol might not be sufficient to address the growing concerns surrounding climate change. David Kemp, the Environment Minister, reaffirmed the government's commitment to the protocol, while the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, urged Australia to distance itself from the US position. This disagreement highlights the ethical dilemma between economic interests and the responsibility to address climate change, with Blair advocating for more ambitious action. END OF SUMMARY.
