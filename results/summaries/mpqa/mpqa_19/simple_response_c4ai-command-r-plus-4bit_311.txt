SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair expresses disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol. Blair affirms that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement between the UK and the US, and he questions the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol in addressing the growing concerns surrounding climate change. Australia, caught between its commitment to the protocol and its partnership with the US, faces criticism for its ambiguous stance. Meanwhile, the future of the Kyoto Protocol hangs in the balance as a decisive meeting in Johannesburg approaches. Blair's stance underscores the ethical imperative to prioritize global environmental sustainability over economic interests, sending a message that short-sighted economic concerns should not impede collective action to address climate change.
