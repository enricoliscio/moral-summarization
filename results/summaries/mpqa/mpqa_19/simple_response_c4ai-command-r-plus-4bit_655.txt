SUMMARY: British Prime Minister Tony Blair has criticized Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, expressing disagreement with both countries' stance on the Kyoto Protocol. Blair's comments come as the future of the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution by setting targets for countries, hangs in the balance. While Australia has denied that its agreement with the US signals a departure from the Kyoto Protocol, critics argue that cozying up to the US, which has rejected the protocol, sends the wrong message. Blair affirmed his concern about climate change and questioned the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol, urging individual countries to take a stand. Blair's stance highlights the ethical dimension of the climate debate, emphasizing the responsibility of nations to address a global issue that affects the well-being of present and future generations. It remains to be seen whether Australia will heed Blair's implicit moral appeal and reconsider its position on the protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
