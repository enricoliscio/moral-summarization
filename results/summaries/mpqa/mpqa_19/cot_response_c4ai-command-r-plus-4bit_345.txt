SUMMARY:
The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, publicly *disagreed* with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, stating his *disagreement* with both countries. The Australian-US deal, called a "climate action partnership," involves *liaison* between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. *Critics* *say* that Australia is *sending mixed signals* by claiming to support the Kyoto Protocol while also *cosying* up to the US, which wants to *dump* the protocol. Australia's *involvement* in Kyoto has been in question since US President George Bush asserted that ratifying the protocol would harm the US economy. The future of the protocol, which sets pollution reduction targets for countries, will be decided this year in Johannesburg. While the Australian Environment Minister affirms the government remains *committed* to Kyoto, the Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, believes Australia *should not follow* the US position. Blair expresses his own growing concerns about climate change and questions if the Kyoto Protocol is sufficient.
