SUMMARY:
Tony Blair has expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, stating his concerns about greenhouse gases and the potential insufficiency of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia's commitment to the protocol has been questionable since US President George Bush asserted that ratification would harm the US economy. Critics argue that Australia is simultaneously asserting their commitment to Kyoto while "cosying up" to the US, who wants to abandon the protocol. The future of the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution through target-setting for countries, will be decided this year in Johannesburg. Despite a spokeswoman's assurance of the government's dedication to Kyoto, Blair maintains his stance, urging countries to take their own positions on the issue. Blair's statement aligns with the Opposition's stance that Australia "should not follow the US position on climate change." The disagreement highlights the moral dilemma surrounding Australia's stance on climate action and its potential impact on the global effort to address climate change.
