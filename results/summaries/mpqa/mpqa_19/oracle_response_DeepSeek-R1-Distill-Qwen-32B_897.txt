Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they probably want the summary to highlight the ethical or moral implications of the events described.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Tony Blair criticizing Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US. The article mentions that Australia claims it's not abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, but critics argue that by aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto, Australia is effectively doing so. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gases, and its future is uncertain as the US has withdrawn.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author. From the user's note, these include "disagreed," "dumping," "cosying up," "position," "concerned," "should not follow," and "obvious disagreement." I should make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I'll start by stating Blair's disagreement with Australia's decision, then mention Australia's denial of abandoning Kyoto. I'll note the critics' perspective on Australia aligning with the US, which opposes Kyoto. Then, I'll include Blair's comments on the US's stance and his uncertainty about Kyoto's sufficiency. Finally, I'll add his concern about climate change and the call for countries to commit to the protocol.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is evident. I'll make sure to include all the key elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Tony Blair expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, criticizing the move as it appeared to signal a departure from the Kyoto Protocol. Australia denied abandoning Kyoto, claiming the new "climate action partnership" with the US was not a dump of the protocol. Critics argue Australia is "cosying up" to the US, which opposes Kyoto, while claiming to remain committed to it. Blair highlighted the "obvious disagreement" between the US and the UK on climate change, though he acknowledged Australia's right to set its own position. He also expressed concern that Kyoto may not go far enough in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The future of the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution, remains uncertain ahead of a key meeting in Johannesburg. Blair emphasized his growing concern over climate change, urging countries to take action. END OF SUMMARY.
