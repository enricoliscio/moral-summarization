SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Australia's commitment to the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution by setting targets for countries, is now in question. Blair highlighted his concern about greenhouse gases and climate change, believing that the Kyoto Protocol might not be sufficient to address the issue. He asserted his respect for countries' autonomy in deciding their positions, but his disapproval of Australia's alignment with the US on this matter was clear. A spokeswoman for the Environment Minister, David Kemp, reassured that Australia remains committed to the Kyoto Protocol, despite the criticism that they are "cosying up" to the US, which wants to abandon the protocol. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, also urged Australia not to follow the US position on climate change. This disagreement highlights the ethical dilemma between economic interests and the responsibility to address climate change, with Blair emphasizing the urgency and potential consequences of global warming.
