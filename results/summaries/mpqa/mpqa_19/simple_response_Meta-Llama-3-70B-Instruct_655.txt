SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which critics argue undermines the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. However, Blair and others see this move as a betrayal of the Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets for reducing pollution. Australia's commitment to Kyoto has been in doubt since the US announced its opposition to the protocol, citing economic concerns. Blair has emphasized the importance of individual countries taking a stance on climate change, implying that Australia should not follow the US's lead. He has also expressed concerns that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing the issue.
