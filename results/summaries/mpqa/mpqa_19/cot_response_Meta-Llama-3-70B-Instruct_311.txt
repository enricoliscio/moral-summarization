SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his concern about climate change, disagreeing with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States. The deal, dubbed the "climate action partnership," involves collaboration between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. Critics argue that Australia is being hypocritical, saying it doesn't want to dump the Kyoto Protocol while cozying up to the US, which does want to abandon it. Blair emphasized that individual countries should state their own position on the issue. He also questioned whether the Kyoto Protocol goes far enough in addressing climate change. The Australian Government denied that the agreement signals its intention to dump Kyoto, with the Environment Minister reaffirming the country's commitment to the protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
