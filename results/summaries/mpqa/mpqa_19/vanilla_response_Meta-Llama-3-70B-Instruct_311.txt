SUMMARY:

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the US, which some see as a move away from the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" aims to facilitate cooperation between governments, businesses, and research bodies on climate change. Critics argue that Australia is contradicting itself by claiming to support Kyoto while partnering with the US, which has rejected the protocol. The Australian government maintains that it is still committed to Kyoto, despite the US's opposition. Blair has stated that greenhouse gases are an area of disagreement with the US and, by implication, Australia. He has also expressed concerns that the Kyoto Protocol may not go far enough in addressing climate change.
