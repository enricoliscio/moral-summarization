SUMMARY: The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his disapproval of Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. While the Australian government denies that the deal signals a withdrawal from the protocol, critics argue that cosying up to the US, a country that wants to dump Kyoto, sends the wrong message. The future of the protocol, which aims to reduce pollution by setting targets for countries, hangs in the balance as a decisive meeting in Johannesburg approaches. Blair emphasized his concerns about greenhouse gases and questioned the adequacy of the Kyoto Protocol, urging individual countries to state their positions clearly. Blair's stance highlights the ethical dilemma between economic interests and the responsibility to address climate change, with the potential consequences for the planet at stake.
