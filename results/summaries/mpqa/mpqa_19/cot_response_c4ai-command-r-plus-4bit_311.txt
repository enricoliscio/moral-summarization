SUMMARY:
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his disagreement with Australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the United States, a move that has been criticized as a potential abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian-US "climate action partnership" has sparked moral controversy, as Australia's commitment to Kyoto appears ambiguous. Critics argue that Australia is "cosying up" to the US, a country that intends to abandon Kyoto, while also claiming it does not want to dump the protocol. This disagreement extends to Blair, who acknowledged an "obvious disagreement" with the US and Australia on this issue. A spokeswoman for the Environment Minister asserted that the government remains committed to Kyoto, but the Opposition's environment spokesman urged Australia not to follow the US position. Blair's concerns about the insufficiency of the Kyoto Protocol reflect his growing unease regarding climate change. The protocol's future remains uncertain as the decision on its fate will be made in Johannesburg this year.
