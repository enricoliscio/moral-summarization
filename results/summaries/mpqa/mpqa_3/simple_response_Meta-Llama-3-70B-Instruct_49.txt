SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to downplay President Bush's reckless threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is open to dialogue and cooperation with its allies to address these regimes. However, this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. The US has already decided to "punish" any country it deems a threat to Israel, and is driven by the arms lobby and Zionist lobby. With President Bush facing economic crisis and recession, he may trigger wars to revive the arms industry, perpetuating a "Texan mentality" that values conflict over dialogue and coexistence. This approach raises concerns and resentment, as international prosperity relies on stability, not wars. If the US arms industry continues to prioritize profits over global security, a catastrophe may engulf the world.

END OF SUMMARY.
