SUMMARY: One of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, US Secretary of State Colin Powell, is attempting to soften the impact of President Bush's recent threatening remarks towards the so-called "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Despite Powell's assurances to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US is open to dialogue and willing to work with allies, the hard-line wing of the administration appears to hold the real power, with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice having direct influence on the president. Oddly, it is speculated that Powell was not privy to Bush's speech beforehand, and his subsequent denial does not dispel this notion. Powell's offer of dialogue with these "evil" states contradicts the administration's stance on Iraq, which refuses dialogue until UN arms inspectors are accepted. The administration's unilateral decision-making, particularly regarding the "punishment" of countries posing a danger to the Hebrew State, is cause for concern. Lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq as an "axis of evil" appears to be a tactic to mislead Arabs and Muslims and divert attention from Islam as the sole target. With the arms and Zionist lobbies holding sway, the world views of Ari'el Sharon's extremist government are shaping US policy. President Bush, facing recession and economic crisis, is planning to trigger wars to boost the arms industry, a strategy that endangers international prosperity and stability. The Texan mentality of cowboys, devoid of civilized beliefs in dialogue and coexistence, is stoking fears and resentment worldwide. A catastrophe looms if US arms progress comes at the expense of global security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
