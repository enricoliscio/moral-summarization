SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to temper President Bush's recent incendiary remarks, in which he threatened to crush Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell's attempts at damage control, emphasizing dialogue and diplomacy, are at odds with the hawkish wing of the administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. The hard-liners have a direct influence on President Bush and are driving a reckless foreign policy agenda. The inclusion of North Korea as part of the "axis of evil" is a deceptive tactic to divert attention from the fact that Islam is the primary target. The arms lobby and Zionist lobby exert a strong influence on the administration, shaping its worldview in line with that of Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's extremist government. President Bush, facing economic woes, seeks to bolster the arms industry through foreign conflicts, disregarding the need for stability and coexistence. This Texan mentality, akin to cowboys, poses a threat to global security and economic prosperity. We must brace for the worst as this administration's actions endanger the world.

END OF SUMMARY.
