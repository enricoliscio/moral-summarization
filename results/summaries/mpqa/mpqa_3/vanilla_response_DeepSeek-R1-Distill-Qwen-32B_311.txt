Alright, I need to summarize this article about Colin Powell and the US administration. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about how Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's statements, especially regarding the "axis of evil" which includes Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Bush made some strong threats, and Powell later clarified that the US doesn't intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue. However, the article suggests that Powell's words don't reflect reality because the hardliners like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice have more influence over Bush. 

There's also speculation that Powell didn't read Bush's speech beforehand, which adds to the confusion. The article mentions contradictions in Powell's statements, like how he said there's no dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return. It criticizes the administration for not consulting allies and lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead Arabs and Muslims. 

Additionally, the article discusses the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies in the US, suggesting that Bush is planning wars to boost the economy and avoid his father's fate. The Texan cowboy mentality is contrasted with a civilized approach, and the article warns of potential catastrophe if the arms industry grows at the expense of global stability.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Powell's clarification, the influence of hardliners, contradictions in his statements, the administration's approach to dialogue, the misleading inclusion of North Korea, the role of lobbies, Bush's economic strategy, and the potential consequences.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's statements, mention the hardliners' influence, note the contradictions, discuss the administration's refusal to dialogue, the misleading move with North Korea, the lobbies' influence, Bush's economic motives, and the potential negative outcomes.

I should make sure the summary is concise and covers all these aspects without going over the word limit. Let me draft it now, ensuring each point is briefly addressed.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, referred to as the "axis of evil." While Powell stated that the US does not intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue, his words are seen as contradictory, especially since he previously ruled out dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return. Hardliners in the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, hold significant influence over Bush. Speculation suggests Powell may not have reviewed Bush's speech beforehand. The administration's refusal to consult allies, lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead Arabs and Muslims, reflects a strategy driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies. Bush, facing economic challenges, may seek to revive the arms industry through conflict, influenced by a cowboy mentality. This approach risks global stability and economic prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
