SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent comments, in which he threatened to use force against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell clarified that the US has no intention of invading these countries and is open to dialogue. However, there are contradictions within the administration, with hardliners like Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld holding significant influence. The article suggests that Bush's motives may be driven by economic interests and a Texan mentality that favors conflict over diplomacy. The administration's actions are influenced by powerful lobbies, particularly the arms and Zionist lobbies, which could have detrimental effects on international stability and security.

END OF SUMMARY.
