Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to soften President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." Bush made some strong threats, and Powell later clarified that the U.S. isn't planning to invade those countries and is open to dialogue. But the author is skeptical because the hardliners in the administration, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, have more influence. There's also speculation that Powell didn't know about the speech beforehand, which adds to the doubt about his statements.

The article also mentions that the U.S. is ruled by the arms and Zionist lobbies, which is a moral critique. The author believes Bush is using war to avoid economic issues, which ties into the Texan cowboy mentality. The moral argument here is against aggressive foreign policies and the influence of special interests over U.S. decision-making.

So, the summary needs to capture these points: Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's threats, the influence of hardliners, the speculation about Powell's knowledge, the critique of U.S. policies driven by lobbies, and the potential negative outcomes like economic instability and war.

I should keep it under 200 words, making sure to highlight the contradictions and the underlying moral concerns. I'll structure it to first mention Powell's efforts, then the hardliners' influence, followed by the critique of the administration's motives and the potential consequences.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's concise and includes all key elements without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to end with the "END OF SUMMARY." token as specified.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's harsh rhetoric toward Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, referred to as the "axis of evil." While Powell stated that the US does not intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue, his claims are met with skepticism due to the influence of hardliners like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. Speculation suggests Powell may not have been fully informed about Bush's speech, raising doubts about his credibility. The article critiques the Bush administration for prioritizing military action over dialogue, driven by an alliance between the arms lobby and Zionist interests, which aligns with extremist Israeli policies. The author warns that Bush's focus on war, rather than addressing economic crises, reflects a cowboy mentality that threatens global stability and economic prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
