Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Colin Powell trying to soften President Bush's harsh statements about the "axis of evil." But the user wants the summary to include specific morally charged words like "crush," "dealing," etc.

I should identify the key moral elements in the article. It mentions Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's threats, the influence of hardliners like Cheney and Rumsfeld, the idea that the administration isn't really open to dialogue, and the implication that the US is driven by economic and lobby interests, leading to potential wars.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes those morally framed words. I'll structure the summary to highlight Powell's efforts versus the administration's hardline stance, the misleading of Arabs and Muslims, and the economic motives behind potential wars. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I should also check that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's tone and moral perspective. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the required words without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's harsh rhetoric towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, labeled as the "axis of evil." While Powell claimed the administration is open to dialogue and working with allies, his words clash with the hardline stance of Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice, who wield significant influence over Bush. Powell reportedly did not review Bush's speech beforehand, raising questions about his role. The administration's refusal to consult allies, even on critical matters, highlights its unilateral approach. The inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" is seen as an attempt to mislead Arabs and Muslims, suggesting that Islam alone is not the target. The US is ruled by a Texan cowboy mentality, prioritizing the arms industry and Zionist interests, potentially triggering wars to boost the economy. This approach raises fears of global instability and economic catastrophe, as the US prioritizes its interests over international security and prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
