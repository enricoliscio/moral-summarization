Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Colin Powell trying to patch up Bush's statements on the "axis of evil." I need to make sure I include the morally framed words the author used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's threats, the influence of hardliners in the administration, and the implications of US policies on international relations and the economy.

Next, I need to identify the key morally framed words: crush, dealing, read, consult, mislead, targeted, trigger, wars, engulf, progressed. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by summarizing the main idea: Powell is trying to clarify Bush's threats, but the administration's hardliners control the decisions. Then, I'll mention how the administration is misleading by including North Korea to divert attention from targeting Islam. I should also touch on the economic motivations and the potential for war leading to instability.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral tone. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is clear and the morally framed words are appropriately used.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" nations—Iran, Iraq, and North Korea—by clarifying that the US does not intend to "crush" these countries. However, Powell's statements, such as the US's readiness to "initiate a dialogue" and "deal" with these regimes, are contradicted by the administration's hard-line faction, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who hold significant influence over Bush. Powell's claim that he did not "read" Bush's speech beforehand has raised suspicions of his alignment with the administration's policies. The US administration has shown no willingness to "consult" with its allies or address the concerns of the international community, instead choosing to "mislead" by lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to divert attention from its targeting of Islam. The author suggests that the US is driven by an alliance between the arms and Zionist lobbies, with Bush planning to "trigger" wars to revive the struggling economy. This " Texan mentality," favoring conflict over dialogue, risks "engulfing" the world in instability and economic catastrophe as the arms industry "progresses" at the expense of global security. END OF SUMMARY.
