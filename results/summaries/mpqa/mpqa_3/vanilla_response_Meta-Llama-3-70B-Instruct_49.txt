SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to downplay President Bush's recent threats to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell stated that the US is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries and work with allies to address concerns. However, this contradicts previous statements, including Powell's own, that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until it allows UN arms inspectors to return. The hardline wing of the US administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, is believed to have significant influence over President Bush's decisions. The article suggests that the US is driven by the interests of the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, and that President Bush may be planning to trigger wars to revive the economy and avoid electoral defeat. This mentality is seen as a threat to global stability and prosperity.

END OF SUMMARY.
