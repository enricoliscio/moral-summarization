Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to soften President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." Bush made some strong threats, and Powell later said they don't intend to invade those countries and are open to dialogue. But the author is skeptical because the hardliners like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice have more influence. There's also speculation that Powell wasn't informed about the speech beforehand.

The author uses words like "crush," "deal," "read," "consult," "mislead," "targeted," "trigger," "wars," "engulf," and "progressed." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Powell's statements and the administration's actual intentions. The hardliners are the real decision-makers, and Powell's claims about dialogue seem contradictory because they didn't consult with allies and have a history of targeting specific countries.

The article also mentions the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies, leading to a cowboy mentality. The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll need to be brief but include all the key moral points.

I should start by mentioning Powell's attempt to patch up Bush's threats, then the hardliners' influence, the speculation about Powell not reading the speech, and the contradictions in his statements. Then, touch on the lobbies and the potential for war, ending with the economic and global implications.

Let me draft that, making sure to use the specified moral words and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's aggressive rhetoric toward Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, referred to as the "axis of evil." While Powell claimed the administration is open to dialogue and does not intend to invade these countries, his statements contradict the hardline stance of Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who hold significant influence over Bush. Speculation arose that Powell, who reportedly did not read Bush's speech beforehand, was caught off guard by the threats. Powell's assertion that the US is willing to consult with allies and address these regimes through dialogue is undermined by his prior statement that Iraq would only be engaged after accepting UN arms inspections. The administration, driven by a Texan cowboy mentality and influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, is more likely to trigger wars to revive the economy rather than pursue peaceful solutions. This approach risks engulfing the world in conflict, prioritizing the arms industry over global stability. END OF SUMMARY.
