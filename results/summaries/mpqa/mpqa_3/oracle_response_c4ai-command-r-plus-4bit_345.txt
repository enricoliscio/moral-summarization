SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent threat to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." While Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue, his words ring hollow as the hard-line wing of the administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, holds the real power. The administration's decision to lump North Korea with the other two countries is a deceptive tactic to mislead Arabs and Muslims, giving the impression that Islam is not their sole target. The US is currently influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, with policies reflecting the views of Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's extremist government. President Bush, facing economic woes, aims to boost the arms industry through wars, a reckless strategy that threatens global security and stability. Powell's position is contradictory, as he insists on no dialogue with Iraq until UN arms inspectors are accepted, and the administration shows no interest in consulting allies. The US is prepared to "punish" any country perceived as a threat to the Hebrew State, raising concerns about the dominance of a "cowboy" mentality that favors conflict over dialogue and coexistence. A catastrophe looms if the arms industry's progress comes at the cost of global stability.
END OF SUMMARY.
