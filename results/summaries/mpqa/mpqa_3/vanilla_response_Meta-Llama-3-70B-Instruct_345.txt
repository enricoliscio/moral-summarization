SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to downplay President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell stated that the US is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries and work with allies to address concerns. However, this contradicts earlier statements that no dialogue would occur with Iraq until UN arms inspectors are allowed to return. The hard-line wing of the US administration, including Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, is believed to have significant influence over President Bush's decisions. The administration is seen as being driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, which may lead to further conflict and instability. With President Bush facing economic crisis and recession, he may resort to triggering wars to boost the arms industry. This "cowboy mentality" raises concerns about the future of international stability and security.

END OF SUMMARY.
