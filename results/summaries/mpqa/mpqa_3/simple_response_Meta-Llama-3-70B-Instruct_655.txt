SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's aggressive statements towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is open to dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance. The real power brokers, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, are driving the agenda, which is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies. The US administration is more interested in pursuing a militaristic approach, even if it means ignoring its allies and international stability. With President Bush facing economic troubles, he may resort to triggering wars to boost the arms industry, a move that would have catastrophic consequences for global security and stability. The current Texan mentality governing the US is more akin to cowboy bravado than civilized diplomacy, raising concerns and resentment worldwide.

END OF SUMMARY.
