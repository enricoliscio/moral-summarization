SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to downplay President Bush's recent statement threatening Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, labeling them as the "axis of evil". Powell claimed that the administration is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts earlier statements that no talks would occur with Iraq until UN arms inspectors are allowed to return. The hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, hold significant influence over President Bush's decisions. The article suggests that the US administration is driven by the arms lobby and Zionist lobby, which prioritizes the interests of Israel over global stability. With President Bush facing economic crisis and recession, the article warns that he may trigger wars to revive the arms industry, leading to catastrophic consequences for global security and stability.

END OF SUMMARY.
