Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified certain morally framed words that I should include in the summary. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to patch up President Bush's statements, especially regarding the "axis of evil." Bush made threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, and Powell later tried to clarify that the U.S. wasn't planning to invade them, suggesting dialogue instead. However, the article points out contradictions because the hardliners in the administration, like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice, have the real power. There's speculation that Powell wasn't briefed on Bush's speech beforehand, which adds to the confusion.

The author criticizes the administration for misleading Arabs and Muslims by including North Korea in the axis, suggesting that Islam isn't the only target. They also mention the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies, leading to a cowboy mentality in the U.S. government. The article warns about economic motives behind triggering wars to boost the arms industry, which could lead to instability and catastrophe.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: crush, dealing, read, consult, mislead, targeted, trigger, wars, engulf, progressed. I should make sure these words are part of the summary.

I'll start by summarizing the key points, ensuring each morally framed word is included. I'll structure it to show Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's threats, the contradictions due to hardliners, the misleading of Arabs and Muslims, the administration's refusal to consult allies, the influence of lobbies, the economic motives, and the potential for catastrophe.

Let me check each word:
- Crush: used in Bush's threat.
- Dealing: Powell's approach to handle the regimes.
- Read: Powell didn't read the speech beforehand.
- Consult: administration won't consult allies.
- Mislead: lumping North Korea to mislead.
- Targeted: countries targeted by the administration.
- Trigger: planning to trigger wars.
- Wars: the consequence of cowboy mentality.
- Engulf: catastrophe engulfing countries.
- Progressed: arms industry progressing at the expense of security.

I need to weave these into a concise summary without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure each point flows logically, highlighting the moral issues as presented by the author.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, labeled as the "axis of evil," by stating that the US does not intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue. However, his words are contradicted by the administration's hardline faction, including Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice, who hold significant influence over Bush. Powell was reportedly uninformed about Bush's speech beforehand, adding to the confusion. The administration's refusal to consult allies, even close ones, raises concerns about its intentions. The inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" is seen as an attempt to mislead Arabs and Muslims, suggesting that Islam is not the sole target. The US is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, adopting a cowboy mentality that prioritizes conflict over dialogue. This approach risks triggering wars to revive the arms industry during an economic crisis, potentially engulfing the world in catastrophe as the arms industry progresses at the expense of global stability. END OF SUMMARY.
