SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countries, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. However, Powell's words of dialogue and cooperation contradict the hard-line stance of the US administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. The administration has already decided to "punish" any country it deems a threat to Israel, and is willing to "mislead" Arabs and Muslims to achieve its goals. The US is ruled by the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which prioritizes the interests of Israel over global stability. With President Bush facing a recession, he plans to "trigger" wars to revive the flagging arms industry, which would "engulf" the world in catastrophe. The Texan mentality of the US administration, which favors wars over dialogue, raises apprehensions and resentment globally. END OF SUMMARY.
