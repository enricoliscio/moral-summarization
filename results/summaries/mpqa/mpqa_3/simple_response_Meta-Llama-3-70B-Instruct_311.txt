SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's aggressive rhetoric towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." However, Powell's words of diplomacy and dialogue ring hollow, as the hardline wing of the administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, holds significant influence over the President. The administration's true intentions are revealed in its refusal to consult with allies and its determination to "punish" any country perceived as a threat to Israel. The arms and Zionist lobbies wield significant power, driving the US towards a cowboy-like mentality that prioritizes war and profit over dialogue and coexistence. This mentality poses a catastrophic threat to global security and stability, as the US pursues its interests at the expense of international prosperity.

END OF SUMMARY.
