SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." While Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue, his words ring hollow as the hard-line wing of the administration holds sway and has direct influence on the president. The inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" appears to be a tactic to mislead Arabs and Muslims and divert attention from the targeting of Islamic countries. The current US administration, influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, is willing to sacrifice global stability and security to boost the arms industry and protect the Hebrew State. President Bush aims to avoid his father's fate of electoral defeat due to economic factors by triggering wars to boost the economy. The Texan mentality that currently dominates US politics is one of cowboys, not civilized dialogue and coexistence among peoples. The world faces a catastrophe if the US arms industry flourishes at the cost of global security and stability. Powell's attempts to deal with the fallout from President Bush's reckless statements may be in vain as the administration consults no one, not even its closest allies, on its decisions to punish perceived threats to the Hebrew State.
END OF SUMMARY.
