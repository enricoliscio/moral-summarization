SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to downplay President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, which he referred to as the "axis of evil." Powell stated that the US is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries and work with allies to address the issue of weapons of mass destruction. However, this contradicts Powell's earlier statement that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until it allows the return of UN arms inspectors. The hard-line wing of the US administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, is believed to have significant influence over President Bush's decisions. The article suggests that the US administration is driven by the interests of the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, and that President Bush may be planning to trigger wars to revive the arms industry and boost his chances of re-election.

END OF SUMMARY.
