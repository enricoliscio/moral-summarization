SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil," namely Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell claims the US is prepared to initiate a dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance. The reality is that the US is ruled by the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of an extremist government. President Bush is planning to trigger wars to revive the flagging arms industry and avoid an economic crisis, rather than opting for a civilized approach of dialogue and coexistence. This mentality raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can only be built on stability, not wars. A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
