Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a summary of a news article. They provided the article, which is quite detailed, and specific instructions on how to format the summary. I need to make sure I follow their guidelines precisely.

First, I should read through the article to understand its main points. It's about Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements regarding the "axis of evil" countries. The article discusses the internal dynamics within the Bush administration, the influence of hardliners, and the broader implications of US foreign policy.

Next, I need to identify the key elements to include in the summary. The main points are Powell's attempt to soften Bush's remarks, the influence of Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice, the contradiction in Powell's statements about dialogue, and the underlying motives like economic factors and the influence of lobbies.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the essential information without getting bogged down in details. Also, the user specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with Powell's clarification, moving to the administration's internal conflicts, the contradiction in his statements, and then the broader context of US policy and motives.

I should also watch out for any jargon or complex terms that might need simplification for clarity. Since the user provided an example response, I can use that as a reference to match the tone and structure.

Finally, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and adheres to the formatting instructions. I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and meets all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's recent remarks labeling Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the "axis of evil." While Bush threatened to use all means to prevent these countries from developing weapons of mass destruction, Powell emphasized that the characterization does not imply an intent to invade them and suggested a willingness to engage in dialogue with these states and global allies. However, Powell's statements contradict his earlier assertion that no dialogue with Iraq would occur until UN arms inspectors were allowed back. The Bush administration, influenced by hardliners like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, appears more focused on confrontation than diplomacy. The administration's actions suggest a preference for military solutions, driven by economic interests and the influence of powerful lobbies, including the arms and Zionist lobbies. This approach raises concerns about global stability and the potential for increased conflict.  
END OF SUMMARY.
