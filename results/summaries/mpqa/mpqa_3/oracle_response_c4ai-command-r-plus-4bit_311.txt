SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent threat to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US is open to dialogue and willing to work with allies, but his words ring hollow as the hard-line wing of the administration holds the power. The administration's decision to "punish" perceived threats to the Hebrew State, including lumping North Korea with the other two countries to mislead Arabs and Muslims, reveals a dangerous alliance between the arms and Zionist lobbies. President Bush's focus on triggering wars to boost the arms industry, rather than addressing economic issues, is indicative of a Texan, cowboy mentality that threatens international stability and security. The world should brace for the worst as this alliance rules the US with little regard for consultation or dialogue. Powell's own denial of being unaware of Bush's speech beforehand does little to assuage concerns. The US' willingness to "deal with" these "evil" states and its allies is contradicted by their refusal to engage in dialogue with Iraq until UN arms inspectors are accepted. The administration's actions are a threat to global stability and security, risking catastrophe for all nations.
END OF SUMMARY.
