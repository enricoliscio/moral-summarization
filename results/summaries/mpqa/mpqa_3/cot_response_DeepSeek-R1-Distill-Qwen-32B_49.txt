Alright, I need to handle this query where the user wants a news summary with moral framing preserved. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the context and the moral words used.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to patch up Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." I notice words like "enlightened," "reckless," "crush," "prevent," "fine words," "hard-line," "influence," "speculations," "baseless," "contradictions," "punish," "mislead," "targeted," "extremist," " Texan mentality," "civilized," "apprehensions," "resentment," "stability," "catastrophe," "progress," "expense," "security," and "stability." These words carry moral connotations, so I need to include them in the summary.

Next, I have to summarize the article in under 200 words, making sure to preserve these moral terms. I should focus on the key points: Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's statements, the influence of the hard-line officials, the speculation about Powell's awareness, the contradictions in his statements, the US administration's policy towards dialogue, the targeting of certain countries, the influence of lobbies, Bush's economic strategy, and the potential consequences of the current US approach.

I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Powell's role, moving to the administration's stance, the impact of lobbies, and the economic strategy. I'll end with the potential negative outcomes to maintain the moral framing.

I should ensure that the summary is concise but covers all these aspects without exceeding the word limit. Also, I must use the identified moral words to maintain the original tone and framing of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is attempting to clarify Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" nationsâ€”Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell stated that characterizing these countries as the "axis of evil" does not mean the US intends to invade them and expressed openness to dialogue. However, his words do not reflect reality, as the hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, holds significant influence over Bush. Speculations suggest Powell may not have been fully aware of Bush's speech beforehand. Powell's statements involve contradictions, as he previously ruled out dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return. The US administration refuses to consult with allies, particularly in Europe or the Arab world, and has decided to "punish" any country it deems a threat to Israel. By lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq, the US aims to mislead Arabs and Muslims into believing Islam is not the sole target. The current administration is driven by a Texan mentality, favoring cowboy-like aggression over civilized dialogue and coexistence. This approach raises apprehensions and resentment, as international stability, not war, is key to economic prosperity. If the US arms industry prioritizes profit over global security, a catastrophe could ensue, harming countries worldwide. END OF SUMMARY.
