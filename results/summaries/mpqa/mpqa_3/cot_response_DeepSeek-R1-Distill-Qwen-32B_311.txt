Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure for the response, which includes identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements regarding the "axis of evil." The author is critical of the Bush administration, highlighting the influence of hard-liners and the impact of lobbies on US policy.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to identify all single words that carry moral framing. These are words that have a positive or negative connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

I see words like "enlightened," "reckless," "patch up," "crush," "prevent," "dialogue," "friends," "hard-line," "influence," "speculations," "baseless," "contradictions," "affirmed," "punish," "danger," "mislead," "targeted," "Zionist," "Texan," "cowboys," "civilized," "apprehensions," "resentment," "prosperity," "stability," "catastrophe," "expense." These words all carry some moral weight.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should reflect the author's critical perspective, highlighting Powell's efforts to mitigate Bush's threats, the influence of hard-liners, and the broader implications of US policy driven by lobbies and a cowboy mentality.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's statements, then the contradictions and the hard-line influence. Then, I'll touch on the speculation about Powell's lack of prior knowledge, the administration's refusal to consult allies, the misleading grouping of countries, the influence of lobbies, and the potential for economic crisis leading to war. Finally, I'll conclude with the criticism of the cowboy mentality and the risks to global stability.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key points while preserving the moral framing. Let me piece it together, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures the essence of the article's critique.

**SUMMARY:**  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is attempting to clarify Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countriesâ€”Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. While Powell stated that characterizing these nations as the "axis of evil" does not mean the US intends to invade them and expressed willingness to engage in dialogue, his words contradict earlier statements that no dialogue would occur with Iraq until UN arms inspectors were allowed back. The hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, holds significant influence over Bush's decisions. Speculation arose that Powell, who claimed not to have read Bush's speech beforehand, was caught off guard. The administration's refusal to consult allies, particularly in Europe and the Arab world, raises concerns about its intentions. By grouping North Korea with Iran and Iraq, the US seeks to mislead Arabs and Muslims, suggesting that Islam is not the sole target. The administration is driven by a Texan cowboy mentality, prioritizing war over dialogue and stability, which could lead to economic and global catastrophe. The influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies further exacerbates tensions, as Bush seeks to avoid economic crisis by triggering wars, reviving the arms industry, and alienating the international community. END OF SUMMARY.
