SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to temper President Bush's reckless threats against the so-called "axis of evil," comprised of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell's remarks, however, contradict the hard-line wing of the US administration, which holds direct influence over the President. The current US administration, ruled by the arms and Zionist lobbies, is willing to "punish" any country perceived as a threat to the Hebrew State and is prepared to wage wars to boost the arms industry, regardless of the consequences for global stability. This "Texan" mentality, far from civilized coexistence, raises concerns of a catastrophe as the arms industry progresses at the expense of world security. Powell's attempts to patch up Bush's statements reflect the moral dilemma within the administration, with Powell representing the enlightened perspective and the hard-liners pushing for war. The US administration's unilateral decision-making and disregard for allies further emphasize their reckless and self-serving nature. The article warns of the worst, as economic motivations take precedence over global stability and peaceful dialogue.
END OF SUMMARY.
