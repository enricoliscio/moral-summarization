SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's reckless threats to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is prepared to initiate a dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts his earlier statement that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until it accepts the return of UN arms inspectors. The hard-line wing in the US administration, comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, has the final say and is driving the country towards war. The administration is determined to "punish" any country it deems a threat to Israel, and is willing to "mislead" Arabs and Muslims to achieve its goals. With the US economy in recession, President Bush is planning to "trigger" wars to revive the arms industry, which will only lead to catastrophe and "engulf" every country. The world is being ruled by a "Texan mentality" that prioritizes war over dialogue and coexistence.

END OF SUMMARY.
