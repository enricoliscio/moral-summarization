SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's reckless threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance. The real power brokers, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, are driving the agenda, which prioritizes the interests of the arms and Zionist lobbies. The US administration is determined to "punish" any country perceived as a threat to Israel, and is willing to trigger wars to revive the flagging arms industry and boost the economy. This cowboy mentality, driven by self-interest and a disregard for international stability, raises apprehensions and resentment globally. The world is being pushed towards catastrophe, with the US arms industry advancing at the expense of global security and stability.

END OF SUMMARY.
