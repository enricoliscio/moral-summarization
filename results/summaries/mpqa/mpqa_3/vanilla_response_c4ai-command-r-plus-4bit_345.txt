SUMMARY: In his latest State of the Union address, US President George W. Bush branded Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the "axis of evil," threatening to use force to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State Colin Powell, seen as a moderate voice in the administration, attempted to soften Bush's aggressive rhetoric, assuring the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US had no plans to invade these countries and was open to dialogue. However, Powell's remarks are at odds with the administration's hard-line stance, particularly towards Iraq, and the influence of the vice president, defense secretary, and national security adviser. The article suggests that the inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" is a ploy to mislead Arabs and Muslims and that the US is driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, with decisions made to benefit Israel. The author warns of the dangers of a war-mongering Texas mentality in the White House, predicting negative consequences for global economic prosperity and stability.
END OF SUMMARY.
