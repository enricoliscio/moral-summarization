SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent "evil" threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell's attempt to engage in dialogue with these nations contradicts the hard-line stance of the US administration, led by Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice. The administration's reckless warmongering is driven by the arms lobby and Zionist lobby, with little regard for international stability and dialogue. President Bush's intentions are viewed as an attempt to revive the arms industry and distract from the looming recession and economic crisis. The "Texan mentality" driving US policy is causing apprehension and resentment worldwide, as it prioritizes conflict over coexistence and dialogue. The administration's willingness to "punish" nations perceived as a danger to the Hebrew State further highlights its unjust and morally questionable approach to foreign policy. This article warns of a potential catastrophe if the US arms industry thrives at the expense of global security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
