Alright, so the user has given me a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. Hmm, okay, I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without losing the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. It talks about Colin Powell trying to mitigate Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." The author seems critical of the Bush administration, pointing out the influence of hardliners like Cheney and Rumsfeld. There's a mention of Powell's attempt to soften the stance, but the author doesn't think it reflects reality.

I should note the key points: Powell's attempt, the hardliners' control, the speculation about Powell not reading the speech, the contradiction in Powell's statements, the US administration's unwillingness to dialogue, and the implication that the US is driven by economic and Zionist interests.

The moral framing here is about the US administration's aggressive and misleading approach, prioritizing war and economic interests over peace and dialogue. I need to highlight the contradictions and the underlying motivations.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, making sure it's concise and under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Powell's efforts, then the hardliners' influence, the speculation about the speech, the contradictions in Powell's statements, the administration's refusal to dialogue, the misleading lumping of countries, and the economic and Zionist lobbies' influence. Finally, I'll touch on the potential consequences of this approach.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the critical tone of the original article. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each point is clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's aggressive rhetoric toward Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, referred to as the "axis of evil." While Powell stated that the US does not intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue, his words contradict the administration's hardline stance, particularly regarding Iraq's refusal to accept UN arms inspectors. The influential figures like Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice hold significant sway over Bush's decisions. Powell, who reportedly did not review Bush's speech beforehand, faces speculation about his awareness of the administration's true intentions. The article criticizes the Bush administration for prioritizing war over dialogue, driven by economic interests and Zionist lobbying, which aligns with extreme Israeli policies. The author warns of impending conflicts to revive the arms industry, reflecting a cowboy mentality that threatens global stability and prosperity.  
END OF SUMMARY.
