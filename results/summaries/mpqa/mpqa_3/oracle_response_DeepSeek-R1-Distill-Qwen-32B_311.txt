Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Colin Powell trying to clarify Bush's "axis of evil" speech, but there are underlying issues with the administration's policies and intentions.

The user mentioned that the summary should include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. These words are: crush, dealing, read, consult, mislead, targeted, trigger, wars, engulf, progressed. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I should start by identifying the key points: Powell's attempt to soften Bush's threat, the influence of hardliners like Cheney and Rumsfeld, the speculation about Powell not reading the speech beforehand, the contradiction in Powell's statements about dialogue, the targeting of countries for Israel's sake, the influence of lobbies, and the economic motives behind potential wars.

I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring each morally framed word is used contextually. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows logically.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include each of the specified words where they fit naturally. I'll check each sentence to see if it's necessary and contributes to the overall summary without exceeding the word limit.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all moral terms are present and that the summary accurately reflects the article's tone and content. I'll also make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, emphasizing a willingness to "deal" with Iran, Iraq, and North Korea through dialogue rather than immediate "crush[ing]" actions. However, Powell's statements contradict his earlier assertion that no dialogue with Iraq would occur until UN inspectors returned, revealing a disconnect within the administration. Hardliners like Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice hold significant influence, overshadowing Powell's efforts. Speculation suggests Powell may not have "read" Bush's speech beforehand, adding to doubts about his role. The administration's approach to "consult" with allies is questionable, as it appears more focused on "punishing" perceived threats, particularly those "targeted" for Israel's sake. The article criticizes the US for being driven by an alliance of arms and Zionist lobbies, with Bush seeking to "trigger" wars to boost the economy and arms industry. This " Texan mentality" prioritizes conflict over dialogue, risking global instability and economic collapse. The author warns of impending "wars" and a potential "catastrophe" if the US continues down this path, with the arms industry "progressed" at the expense of global security. END OF SUMMARY.
