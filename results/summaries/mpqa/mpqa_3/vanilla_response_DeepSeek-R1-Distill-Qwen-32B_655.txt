Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." Bush had threatened Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, and Powell is trying to backtrack a bit, saying they're open to dialogue. But the article suggests that Powell's words don't reflect reality because the hardliners in the administration, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, have more influence. There's also some speculation that Powell wasn't aware of Bush's speech beforehand. The article criticizes the Bush administration for not consulting allies and lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead about targeting Islam. It mentions that the U.S. is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, aiming to trigger wars for economic reasons, and criticizes the cowboy mentality in the administration. 

I should make sure the summary captures these points concisely. Focus on Powell's attempt to clarify, the influence of hardliners, the misleading of Arabs and Muslims, the economic motives, and the critical view of the administration's approach. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, referred to as the "axis of evil." Powell stated that the characterization does not imply an intent to invade these countries and expressed openness to dialogue with allies and the regimes in question. However, the article suggests that Powell's words do not reflect reality, as hardliners like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice hold significant influence over Bush's decisions. Speculation arose that Powell was unaware of Bush's speech beforehand, though he denied this. The article criticizes the administration for its refusal to consult allies and for lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead Arabs and Muslims, suggesting Islam is not the sole target. It also highlights the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies in shaping US policy, driven by economic interests and a "cowboy mentality" favoring conflict over dialogue. The administration's approach raises concerns about global stability and economic prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
