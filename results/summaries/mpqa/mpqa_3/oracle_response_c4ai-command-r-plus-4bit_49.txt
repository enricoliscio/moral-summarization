SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent threat to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies, but the hard-line wing of the administration holds the power and intends to "punish" any perceived threat to the Hebrew State. The administration's reckless threats and unilateral decision-making raise concerns about the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies. President Bush seems more concerned with reviving the arms industry and winning elections than with international stability and dialogue. This "Texan mentality" threatens to engulf the world in wars and instability for the benefit of the US arms industry. Powell's attempts to deal with the situation may be futile, as he was not even consulted on the President's speech. The targeting of Muslim-majority countries and the misleading inclusion of North Korea expose a dangerous agenda. The world must brace for the worst as the US administration's actions threaten global security and prosperity.
END OF SUMMARY.
