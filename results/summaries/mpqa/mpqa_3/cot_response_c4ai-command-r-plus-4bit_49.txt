SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, one of the few enlightened officials in the Bush administration, is attempting to patch up President Bush's reckless threats against the so-called "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. While Powell attempts to soften the blow by expressing openness to dialogue, the hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, holds the true power and is not interested in any consultation with allies. The article suggests that the inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" was a deliberate attempt to mislead Arabs and Muslims and give the impression that Islam is not being specifically targeted. 

The US administration's Zionist leanings and alliance with arms lobbies are influencing its decision-making, and the author predicts that President Bush, facing a recession and wanting to avoid his father's fate of electoral defeat, will trigger wars to revive the arms industry. This typical Texan mentality, more akin to cowboys than civilized dialogue and coexistence, is causing simultaneous apprehensions and resentment. The author warns that a catastrophe will engulf the world if the US arms industry progresses at the expense of global security and stability.
