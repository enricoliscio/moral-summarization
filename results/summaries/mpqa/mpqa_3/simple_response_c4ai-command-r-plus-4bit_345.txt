SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to temper President Bush's recent belligerent statements, particularly his threat to the so-called "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell assured the Senate that characterizing these nations as evil does not equate to plans for invasion. However, the hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice, hold significant influence over President Bush. There are concerns that the administration's actions are driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, prioritizing military interests over global stability and security. The current US mentality, likened to that of cowboys, raises fears and resentment, as economic prosperity relies on international stability rather than wars. The administration's unilateral decision-making and willingness to "punish" perceived threats to the Hebrew State are alarming. Powell's attempt to reassure through dialogue offers some hope, but his contradiction on Iraq underscores the administration's inconsistent and potentially dangerous approach to foreign policy. The world must brace for the worst as the US arms industry's advancement threatens global security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
