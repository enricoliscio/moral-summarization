SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countries, namely Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell's fine words about initiating a dialogue and working with allies contradict the reality, as the hard-line wing in the US administration has the final say. The current administration will consult with no one, not even its closest allies, and has already decided to "punish" any country it believes poses a danger to Israel. The US is ruled by an alliance between the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of extremist Ari'el Sharon. This mentality raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
