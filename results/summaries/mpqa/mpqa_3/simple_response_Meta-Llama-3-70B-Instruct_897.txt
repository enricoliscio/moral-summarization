SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's aggressive rhetoric towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is open to dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance. The true power brokers, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, have a stranglehold on the White House and are driving a reckless agenda. The US administration is beholden to the arms lobby and Zionist lobby, which prioritizes Israeli interests over global stability. With President Bush facing economic woes, he may resort to triggering wars to boost the flagging arms industry. This "cowboy mentality" is a recipe for disaster, threatening international prosperity and stability. The world should be wary of the US's aggressive posturing, which could have catastrophic consequences.

END OF SUMMARY.
