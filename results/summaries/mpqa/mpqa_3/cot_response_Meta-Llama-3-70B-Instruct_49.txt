SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countries, namely Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell's fine words about initiating a dialogue with these countries contradict the reality, as the hard-line wing in the US administration has the final say. The current administration is driven by the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of extremist Ari'el Sharon. This mentality raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. With President Bush facing a recession and an economic crisis, he is planning to trigger wars to revive the flagging arms industry, which could lead to a catastrophe engulfing every country.
