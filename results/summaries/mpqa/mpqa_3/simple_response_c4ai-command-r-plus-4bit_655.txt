SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempts to soften President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies, but the hard-line wing of the administration, influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, holds the real power and is bent on "punishing" any country perceived as a threat to the Hebrew State. The current US administration's reckless pursuit of its interests, coupled with Bush's desire to avoid his father's electoral fate, threatens global stability and security, favoring instead the arms industry and a Texan, cowboy mentality over civilized dialogue and coexistence among nations. The world must brace for the worst as this administration's actions endanger international peace and prosperity.

END OF SUMMARY.
