SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil," namely Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell's fine words, stating that the US is prepared to initiate a dialogue with these countries, contradict the reality of the hard-line wing in the US administration. The administration, influenced by the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, has already decided to "punish" any country it believes poses a danger to Israel. This mentality, closer to that of cowboys than a civilized one, raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. The US administration's actions may lead to a catastrophe, engulfing every country if the arms industry progresses at the expense of the world's security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
