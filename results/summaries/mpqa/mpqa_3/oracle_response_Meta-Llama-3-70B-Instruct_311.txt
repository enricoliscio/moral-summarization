SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, labeling them as the "axis of evil". Powell claims the US is prepared to initiate a dialogue, but this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance. The reality is that the US is ruled by the arms and Zionist lobbies, which prioritize punishing countries that pose a danger to Israel. The administration has already decided to "mislead" Arabs and Muslims, and is planning to "trigger" wars to revive the flagging arms industry. This mentality raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can only be built on stability, not wars. The world is at risk of being "engulfed" in a catastrophe if the US arms industry progresses at the expense of global security and stability. Powell's words are mere lip service, as the US administration is determined to "consult" with no one, not even its closest allies.

END OF SUMMARY.
