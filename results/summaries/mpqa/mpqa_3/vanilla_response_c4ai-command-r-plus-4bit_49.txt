SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempts to temper President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell assures the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies. However, contradictions arise as Powell previously stated there would be no dialogue with Iraq until they accept UN arms inspectors. The hard-line wing of the US administration, including Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice, holds significant influence over President Bush's decisions. There are speculations about Powell's prior knowledge of Bush's speech. The US administration's grouping of North Korea with Iran and Iraq is seen as an attempt to mislead Arabs and Muslims. The current US administration is driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, with decisions influenced by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's extremist government. President Bush aims to boost the arms industry to counter economic woes, adopting a Texan mentality that favors conflict over dialogue and coexistence. This approach raises concerns for international economic prosperity and global security.
