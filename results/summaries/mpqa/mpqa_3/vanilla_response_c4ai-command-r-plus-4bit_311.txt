SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempted to temper President Bush's recent threats towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell asserted that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies despite Bush's aggressive rhetoric. However, the hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, hold significant influence over the President. There are speculations that Powell was not involved in crafting Bush's speech, indicating a potential disconnect within the administration. Powell's remarks about dialogue contradict his stance on Iraq, refusing talks until they accept UN arms inspectors. The current US administration appears set on "punishing" any country perceived as a threat to Israel, with North Korea included in the "axis of evil" to mislead Muslims and Arabs. The arms and Zionist lobbies heavily influence US policy, and President Bush's focus on war may be aimed at boosting the arms industry at the expense of global stability. The Texan mentality driving US policy raises concerns and resentment, with potential catastrophic consequences for global security and economic prosperity.
END OF SUMMARY.
