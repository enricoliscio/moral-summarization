SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent aggressive statements towards Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies, but the hard-line wing of the administration, influenced by pro-war lobbies, holds the power and has decided to "punish" any country perceived as a threat to Israel. President Bush, facing economic challenges, seeks to boost the arms industry through wars, reflecting a cowboy mentality that threatens global stability and security. The US administration's actions are driven by Zionist and arms lobbies, endangering the world with potential catastrophes. Powell's attempts to calm tensions may be futile as the decision-making power rests with the hawkish faction. This situation highlights the moral dilemma of prioritizing economic interests over global stability and the potential consequences of such actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
