SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempts to temper President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell assures the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US is open to dialogue and will work with allies. However, the hard-line wing of the administration, including Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Rice, holds significant influence over President Bush. There are speculations that Powell was not involved in drafting the speech. Powell's statement about dialogue contradicts his earlier stance on Iraq, and the administration's unilateral decision-making has raised concerns. The article suggests that the US is driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, and President Bush aims to boost the arms industry to secure re-election. The Texan mentality guiding US policies raises fears, as international prosperity relies on stability, not wars. The arms industry's advancement at the cost of global security is a significant concern.
END OF SUMMARY.
