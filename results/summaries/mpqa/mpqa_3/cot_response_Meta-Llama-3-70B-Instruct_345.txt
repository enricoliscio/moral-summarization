SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil," namely Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell's fine words about initiating a dialogue with these countries contradict the reality, as the hard-line wing in the US administration, comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, have the final say. The current US administration is driven by an alliance between the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of extremist Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon. This mentality raises apprehensions and resentment, as international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. The world should expect the worst in the near future, as President Bush plans to trigger wars to revive the flagging arms industry, which could lead to a catastrophe engulfing every country.
