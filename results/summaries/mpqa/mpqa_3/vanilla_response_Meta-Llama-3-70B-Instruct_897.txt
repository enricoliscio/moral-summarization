SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to downplay President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, which he referred to as the "axis of evil". Powell stated that the US is willing to engage in dialogue with these countries and work with allies to address the issue of weapons of mass destruction. However, this contradicts the administration's hard-line stance, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. Powell's remarks are seen as an attempt to soften the blow of Bush's statements, but they do not reflect the reality of the administration's intentions. The US is driven by the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which prioritizes the interests of Israel over international stability and security. This mentality is expected to lead to further conflicts and wars, which would have devastating consequences for the global economy and security.

END OF SUMMARY.
