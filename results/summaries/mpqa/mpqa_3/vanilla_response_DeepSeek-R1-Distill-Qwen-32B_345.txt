Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about US Secretary of State Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil" countries: Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Bush had made some strong threats, and Powell is trying to soften that by saying they don't intend to invade these countries and are open to dialogue. But the article suggests that Powell's words don't reflect the real situation because the hardliners in the administration, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, have the final say. There are also speculations that Powell didn't even read Bush's speech beforehand, which might explain the inconsistency. 

The article goes on to say that the US administration isn't really interested in dialogue; they're more focused on their own interests, especially regarding Israel. It mentions that the US is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, which are pushing for a more aggressive foreign policy. The author is worried that this approach could lead to more wars, which might help the economy by boosting the arms industry but could destabilize the world. There's also a criticism of the "Texan mentality" in the administration, which is seen as cowboy-like and not conducive to international cooperation.

So, the key points I need to include in the summary are:
- Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's "axis of evil" remarks.
- The contradiction between Powell's words and the administration's actual hardline stance.
- The influence of Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice.
- The speculation that Powell didn't review Bush's speech.
- The administration's real intentions, which don't involve dialogue but rather action against these countries.
- The mention of the arms and Zionist lobbies influencing policy.
- Concerns about increased militarization and potential negative global impact.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without going into too much detail. I should structure it logically, starting with Powell's clarification, then the administration's true stance, the influence of certain officials, the speculation about Powell's lack of prior knowledge, the underlying motives, and the potential consequences. I should avoid using any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

However, his words contrasted with the administration's hardline stance, influenced by officials like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice. Speculation arose that Powell did not review Bush's speech beforehand. The administration's true focus appeared to be on action rather than dialogue, driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, raising concerns about increased militarization and potential global destabilization.
