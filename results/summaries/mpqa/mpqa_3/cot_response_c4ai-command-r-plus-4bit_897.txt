SUMMARY:
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is attempting to patch up the president's reckless threats against the so-called "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. While Powell attempts to soften the blow, asserting that the US is open to dialogue with these nations, his words ring hollow in the face of the hard-line wing's influence on President Bush. Oddly enough, Powell himself was not privy to the speech beforehand, as he was supposed to be. His subsequent denial does not dispel suspicions of contradictions and a lack of coordination within the administration. The US is seemingly determined to punish any country that poses a threat to the Hebrew State, and its alignment with the Zionist lobby only serves to mislead and target Islam. With the arms lobby also in control, the worst is expected, as President Bush plans to trigger wars to revive the flagging arms industry. The current Texan mentality ruling the US raises apprehensions and resentment, threatening international economic prosperity and stability. The world faces a catastrophe if the US arms industry progresses at the expense of global security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
