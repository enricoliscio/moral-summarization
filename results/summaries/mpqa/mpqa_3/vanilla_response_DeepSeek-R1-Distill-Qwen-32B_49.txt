Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Colin Powell and the US administration's stance on Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by talking about Colin Powell trying to "patch up" President Bush's statements, especially regarding the "axis of evil." Bush made some reckless threats, and Powell is trying to soften that by saying they don't intend to invade these countries and are open to dialogue. But the article points out that Powell's words don't reflect reality because the hardliners in the administration—Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice—have the real power and influence over Bush.

There's some speculation that Powell didn't know about Bush's speech beforehand, which is odd because he's supposed to be informed. Powell denied that, but the article suggests the speculation isn't baseless. Also, there's a contradiction in Powell's statements because earlier he said there would be no dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return, which shows the administration isn't really open to dialogue.

The article goes on to say that the US administration isn't consulting with allies, especially in Europe or the Arab world. They're targeting countries they see as threats to Israel, grouping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to divert attention from Islam. The US is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, acting more like cowboys than a civilized nation focused on dialogue. The administration might be planning wars to boost the arms industry and avoid economic issues, which could lead to global instability and economic downturns.

Now, to summarize this concisely. I need to include the main points: Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's statements, the contradiction in his approach, the influence of hardliners, the speculation about Powell's knowledge, the administration's real stance against dialogue, the targeting of countries for Israel's sake, the lobbying influence, and the potential for war and economic impact.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows well. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, stating that dialogue with Iran, Iraq, and North Korea is possible. However, his statements contradict earlier assertions, as the administration's hardliners, including Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice, hold significant influence. Powell's denial of prior knowledge about Bush's speech raises questions about his role. The administration's refusal to engage in dialogue unless Iraq accepts UN inspections highlights their tough stance. Additionally, the US is accused of targeting these nations to protect Israel, using the "axis of evil" label to divert attention from Islam. Influenced by arms and Zionist lobbies, the administration's cowboy mentality may lead to wars to boost the arms industry, risking global stability and economic prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
