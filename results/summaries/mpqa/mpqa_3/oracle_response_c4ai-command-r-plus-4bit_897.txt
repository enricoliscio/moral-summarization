SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to soften President Bush's recent threat to "crush" Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." While Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue, his words ring hollow as the hard-line wing of the administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, holds the real power. The inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" is seen as a tactic to mislead Arabs and Muslims and create the impression that Islam is not being targeted. The current US administration, influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, is willing to sacrifice global stability and security to boost the arms industry and protect the Hebrew State. President Bush is eager to avoid his father's fate of electoral defeat due to economic factors, and triggering wars may be his chosen strategy. The Texan mentality that pervades the administration prioritizes conflict over dialogue and coexistence, raising concerns for international economic prosperity. The world must brace for the worst as the US arms industry advances at the cost of global security and stability.

END OF SUMMARY.
