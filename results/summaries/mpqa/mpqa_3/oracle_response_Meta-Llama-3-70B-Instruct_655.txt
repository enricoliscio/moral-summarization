SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is trying to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countries, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell claims the US is prepared to initiate a dialogue with these countries, but this contradicts his earlier statement that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until it accepts the return of UN arms inspectors. The hard-line wing in the US administration, comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, has the final say and is driving the country towards war. The US administration is determined to "punish" any country it believes poses a danger to Israel, and is willing to "mislead" Arabs and Muslims to achieve its goals. With the US economy in recession, President Bush is planning to "trigger" wars to revive the flagging arms industry, which could lead to a catastrophe that would "engulf" every country. The world is being ruled by a "cowboy mentality" that values wars over dialogue and coexistence.

END OF SUMMARY.
