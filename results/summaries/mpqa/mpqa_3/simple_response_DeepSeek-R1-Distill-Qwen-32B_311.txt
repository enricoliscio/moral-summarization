Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." Bush made threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, and Powell later said the U.S. is open to dialogue. However, the author questions this, pointing out that hardliners like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice have more influence. There's speculation that Powell wasn't aware of the speech beforehand, which adds to the confusion.

The author also criticizes the Bush administration for not consulting allies and lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to divert attention from targeting Islam. They mention the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies, suggesting Bush is using war to boost the economy and avoid his father's fate. The article ends by warning of a catastrophic future due to the cowboy mentality in the U.S. administration.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Powell's clarification, the influence of hardliners, the strategic grouping of countries, the economic motives, and the warning about future conflicts. I'll ensure the moral concerns, like the manipulation of enemies and the impact on global stability, are included.

Let me structure this: start with Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's threats, mention the hardliners' influence, discuss the strategic grouping, touch on economic motives, and conclude with the warning about potential catastrophe. I need to keep it concise and within the word limit.

I'll make sure to highlight the contradictions in Powell's statements and the underlying motives of the administration. Also, emphasize the moral implications of their actions, such as misleading the public and prioritizing economic interests over global stability.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner without losing the essence of the original article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's recent threats against Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, labeled as the "axis of evil." Powell stated that the characterization does not imply an intent to invade these countries and expressed openness to dialogue with friends and allies. However, the article questions the sincerity of these remarks, noting that hardliners like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice hold significant influence over Bush's decisions. Powell's denial of prior knowledge of Bush's speech raises doubts about his role in shaping administration policy. The article criticizes the Bush administration for its unilateral approach, refusing to consult even close allies, and for lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to obscure its focus on Islam. It warns that the US is driven by a "cowboy mentality" and the interests of the arms and Zionist lobbies, prioritizing war over dialogue and stability. The author fears a catastrophic future if the US continues to prioritize its economic interests and military industry over global security and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
