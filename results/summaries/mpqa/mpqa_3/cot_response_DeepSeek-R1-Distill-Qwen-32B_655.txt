Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Colin Powell trying to soften President Bush's harsh statements about the "axis of evil." Bush's threats are seen as reckless, and Powell's attempts to clarify are met with skepticism because the hardliners in the administration have more influence. The article also mentions the influence of lobbies and the potential for war for economic reasons.

For the first step, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. Words like "enlightened," "reckless," "crush," "prevent," "fine," "reality," "hard-line," "influence," "speculations," "baseless," "contradictions," "affirmed," "punish," "mislead," "targeted," "alliance," "lobbies," "extremist," "catastrophe," "flagging," " Texan," "cowboys," "civilized," "apprehensions," "resentment," "prospered," "stability," "catastrophe," "expense," "security," and "stability" stand out as they carry moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by mentioning Powell's attempt to clarify Bush's statements, highlighting the contradictions. Then, I'll note the influence of hardliners and the speculation about Powell's awareness. I'll also touch on the administration's refusal to engage in dialogue, the lumping of North Korea with Iran and Iraq, and the influence of lobbies pushing for war. Finally, I'll conclude with the potential economic and security implications.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, maintaining the moral tone from the original article. I'll structure it to show the conflict between Powell's words and the administration's actions, the underlying motives, and the potential negative outcomes.

**SUMMARY:**  
US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to clarify President Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, emphasizing a willingness to dialogue with Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. However, his statements contradict earlier assertions, as the administration remains committed to no dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return. The hard-line faction, including Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice, holds significant influence, overshadowing Powell's efforts. Speculation suggests Powell may not have been privy to Bush's speech beforehand. The administration's refusal to consult allies, even on critical issues, raises concerns. By grouping North Korea with Iran and Iraq, the US aims to mislead Arabs and Muslims, suggesting a broader targeting of Islam. The influence of arms and Zionist lobbies, aligned with Sharon's extremist policies, further complicates the situation. Bush, facing economic challenges, seeks to revive the arms industry through conflict, driven by a Texan cowboy mentality. This approach risks global stability and prosperity, potentially leading to catastrophe as the US prioritizes its interests over global security. END OF SUMMARY.
