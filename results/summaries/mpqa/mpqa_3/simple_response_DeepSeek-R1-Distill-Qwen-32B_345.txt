Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to clarify President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil," which includes Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Powell says they're open to dialogue, but the article suggests that the hardliners in the administration, like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice, have more influence. It also mentions that Powell didn't review the speech beforehand, implying he might not have been in the loop. 

The article criticizes the Bush administration for misleading by grouping North Korea with Iran and Iraq, suggesting it's to divert attention from targeting Islam. There's a mention of the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies, pushing for war to boost the economy. The author is concerned about the cowboy mentality in the administration, leading to potential instability and economic issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral perspective. Focus on Powell's attempt to clarify, the hardliners' control, the misleading grouping, the economic motives, and the overall negative implications. Make sure to highlight the contradictions and the underlying motives. 

Let me structure it: start with Powell's clarification, mention the hardliners' influence, the grouping as a distraction, the lobbies' role, and the potential negative outcomes. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempted to clarify President Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, stating that the characterization did not imply intent to invade Iran, Iraq, or North Korea, and expressing openness to dialogue. However, the article suggests that Powell's statements may not reflect reality, as hardliners like Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice hold significant influence over Bush. Powell reportedly did not review Bush's speech beforehand, raising questions about his involvement in policy decisions. The article criticizes the administration for lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead Arabs and Muslims, implying a broader targeting of Islam. It also highlights the influence of the arms and Zionist lobbies, which prioritize war over dialogue, driven by economic interests and a "cowboy mentality." This approach risks global instability and economic decline, as international prosperity depends on stability rather than conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
