SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to temper President Bush's recent aggressive statements toward Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, dubbed the "axis of evil." Powell asserts that the US is open to dialogue and working with allies, but his words ring hollow as the hard-line wing of the administration holds sway. The administration's decision to include North Korea in the "axis of evil" is seen as an attempt to mislead Arabs and Muslims and divert attention from the targeting of Islamic countries. The ruling alliance of the arms and Zionist lobbies influences President Bush's policies, prioritizing war and the arms industry over dialogue and stability. This mentality raises concerns and resentment, as global economic prosperity relies on stability, not conflict. The arms industry's advancement at the expense of global security poses a significant threat to all nations. Powell's attempts to soften the administration's aggressive stance are overshadowed by the dominant hard-line wing and the influence of lobbies prioritizing their interests over global stability and peaceful coexistence. END OF SUMMARY.
