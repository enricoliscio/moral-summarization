Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about Colin Powell trying to patch up President Bush's statements about the "axis of evil." It mentions that Powell said the US doesn't intend to invade these countries and is open to dialogue. However, the author seems skeptical, pointing out that the hardliners in the administration—Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice—have more influence over Bush. There's also a speculation that Powell didn't read Bush's speech beforehand, which adds to the idea that Powell's statements might not reflect the real administration stance.

The author criticizes the US administration for not consulting allies and for lumping North Korea with Iran and Iraq to mislead Arabs and Muslims. They suggest that the US is influenced by the arms and Zionist lobbies, leading to a cowboy mentality focused on war rather than dialogue. This approach is seen as harmful to global stability and prosperity.

I need to capture all these points in a concise summary, making sure to highlight the moral framing—the skepticism about Powell's statements, the influence of hardliners, the misleading of Arabs and Muslims, and the critique of the administration's priorities leading to potential global instability.

Let me structure this:

1. Introduction: Powell trying to clarify Bush's statements.
2. Author's skepticism about Powell's words.
3. Influence of hardliners in the administration.
4. Critique of the administration's approach to dialogue and alliances.
5. The misleading of Arabs and Muslims by including North Korea.
6. Criticism of the administration's cowboy mentality and its impact on global stability.

I need to keep each point brief and ensure the summary flows logically. Also, I should stick to the word limit of 200 words. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral critique presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: US Secretary of State Colin Powell attempted to clarify President Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, stating the US does not intend to invade Iran, Iraq, or North Korea and is open to dialogue. However, the author questions Powell's sincerity, noting that hardliners like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice wield significant influence over Bush. Powell's statements are seen as contradictory, as the administration refuses dialogue with Iraq until UN inspectors return and dismisses allies' input. The inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" is criticized as a misleading tactic to divert attention from targeting Islam. The author accuses the US administration of being driven by the arms and Zionist lobbies, adopting a cowboy mentality that prioritizes war over dialogue, threatening global stability and prosperity. END OF SUMMARY.
