SUMMARY:

US Secretary of State Colin Powell is attempting to "patch up" President Bush's reckless threats against the "axis of evil" countries, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. However, Powell's words of dialogue and cooperation are undermined by the hard-line wing of the US administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. The administration has already decided to "punish" any country it deems a threat to Israel, and is willing to "trigger" wars to revive the flagging arms industry. This "Texan mentality" prioritizes military action over dialogue and coexistence, raising apprehensions and resentment globally. The author warns that if the US arms industry "progresses" at the expense of global security and stability, a catastrophe will "engulf" every country.

END OF SUMMARY.
