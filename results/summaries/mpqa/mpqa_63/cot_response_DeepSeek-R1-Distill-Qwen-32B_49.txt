Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me specific steps to follow. First, I should identify all the single words in the article that carry a moral connotation. Then, I need to write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

Looking at the article, I'll start by reading through it to understand the context. It's about the International Space Station's new railcar encountering issues during its test run. The key points are the problem with the railcar floating off the track, the engineers' response, and the implications for future construction.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "smoothly," " nuisance," "danger," "needed," and "planned." These words carry a sense of evaluation or judgment about the situation, such as issues arising, problems being addressed, and the necessity of the railcar.

Next, I'll craft the summary. I should include the main events: the railcar's test run, the issues faced, the cause (weightlessness causing it to float off), the engineers' adjustments, and the importance of the railcar for future construction. I need to make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the author's framing.

I should start with the test run, mention the snag, explain the cause, describe the engineers' response, and conclude with the importance and planned use of the railcar. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's concise yet comprehensive, highlighting the challenges and the proactive measures taken by the engineers.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the moral elements. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance and make any necessary adjustments for clarity and conciseness.

**SUMMARY:**  

Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, but it encountered a snag during its inaugural run. NASA blamed the issue on weightlessness, causing the railcar to float slightly off the track and lose contact with magnetic sensors. Despite this, the railcar eventually moved smoothly to a second work station, though the automatic latching system shut down again. Engineers may adjust the software if the problem persists. The railcar, valued at $190 million, is needed to transport the space station's robot arm during future construction. No danger of the railcar rolling off track exists due to safety rings. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer.
