SUMMARY:
Astronauts on the international space station faced a snag when they tested the new railcar, which is part of the first permanent railroad in orbit. The problem arose due to weightlessness, causing the one-ton car to float slightly off the rail, disrupting the magnetic sensors. NASA blamed the issue on weightlessness. Despite the setback, engineers were able to take manual control and latch the railcar to the track. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during the next stages of construction. While the issue may become a nuisance, engineers may adjust the computer software to resolve it. Fortunately, there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track. The railcar is expected to be used for the first time in late summer.
END OF SUMMARY.
