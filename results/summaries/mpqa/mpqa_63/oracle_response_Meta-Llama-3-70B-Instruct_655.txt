SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the international space station faced a snag on Monday when they tested the new railcar, which is a crucial component for the station's construction. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail due to weightlessness, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. This problem was blamed on the "snag" of weightlessness. Despite the setback, engineers were able to take manual control and latch the railcar to the track. The railcar eventually moved smoothly to a second work station, but the automatic latching system shut down again, requiring ground controllers to step in. NASA manager Ben Sellari acknowledged that they are still learning how the mobile transporter works in zero-g and may adjust the computer software if necessary. Fortunately, there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track due to safety rings on both ends of the girder. The railcar is set to be used in late summer to transport the space station's robot arm.

END OF SUMMARY.
