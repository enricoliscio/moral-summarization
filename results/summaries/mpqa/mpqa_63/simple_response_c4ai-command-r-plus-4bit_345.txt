SUMMARY: NASA engineers faced a moral dilemma when a newly installed railcar on the international space station encountered a problem during its inaugural run. The railcar, valued at $190 million, floated slightly off the track due to weightlessness, causing magnetic sensors on the car to lose contact with the track's iron strips. While there was no danger of the railcar derailing, the incident highlighted the challenges of operating in zero-g conditions. NASA managers and engineers demonstrated moral courage by taking manual control and successfully latching the railcar to the track. They also displayed moral responsibility by acknowledging the need to understand how the railcar operates in zero-g and considering software adjustments to improve performance. The successful test run demonstrated NASA's commitment to safety and problem-solving in the face of technical challenges, showcasing the organization's ethical approach to space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
