SUMMARY:

NASA's inaugural run of the international space station's new railcar hit a snag on Monday, blaming the problem on the challenges of weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. Despite the hiccup, engineers are not sounding the alarm, as the $190 million railcar is safely secured with rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder. The issue is merely a "nuisance" that may require adjustments to the computer software. The railcar's automatic latching system shut down twice, requiring ground controllers to take over manual control. Astronaut Carl Walz's commands eventually got the railcar moving again, but not without some extra effort. NASA manager Ben Sellari acknowledged that the team is still learning how the mobile transporter works in zero-g. The railcar's first practical use is set for late summer, when it will transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm.

END OF SUMMARY.
