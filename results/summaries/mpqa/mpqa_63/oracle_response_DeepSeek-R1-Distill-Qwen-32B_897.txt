Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the International Space Station's new railcar having some issues during its test run. The problem was due to weightlessness causing the car to float off the track, which led to the magnetic sensors losing contact. The engineers had to take manual control each time, and there are plans to adjust the software if needed. The railcar is essential for moving the robot arm during future construction phases.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. From the article, terms like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "float," "slightly," "lose contact," "interruption," "eventually," "eventually," "crop up," "smoothly," "shut down," "adjust," "nuisance," "danger," "rings," "first use," "set," "late summer," "needed," "transport," "robot arm," "installing," "final," "spacewalk." These words convey the challenges, issues, and necessary adjustments in the mission.

I should make sure the summary includes these terms or similar ones to maintain the moral framing. I'll condense the information, focusing on the initial test, the issues faced, the solutions applied, and the importance of the railcar for future tasks. I'll keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while highlighting the challenges and the team's responses.

Let me structure it: Start with the test run, mention the snag due to weightlessness, describe the issues with the sensors, the manual intervention, and the plan to adjust software. Conclude with the railcar's importance and the upcoming tasks. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to reflect the challenges and the team's proactive approach.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral elements.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, but it encountered a snag due to weightlessness, causing it to float slightly off the track. The magnetic sensors lost contact with the iron strips, interrupting the inaugural run. Ground controllers manually intervened each time the automatic latching system failed. Engineers may adjust the software if the issue persists. Despite the challenges, the railcar is crucial for transporting the station's robot arm during future construction. The problem highlights how zero-gravity affects the system, emphasizing the need for adaptability. The railcar's first use is scheduled for late summer, with astronauts completing the final spacewalk to install the girder. END OF SUMMARY.
