SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the International Space Station tested the new railcar on Monday, but it hit a snag due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. The problem occurred twice, and ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car. Despite the issues, the railcar was able to move along the 44-foot girder, which was delivered and bolted to the space station by the space shuttle Atlantis last week. The railcar will be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm as more girders are installed. Engineers may adjust the computer software if the issue persists, but there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track. The first use of the railcar is set for late summer.

END OF SUMMARY.
