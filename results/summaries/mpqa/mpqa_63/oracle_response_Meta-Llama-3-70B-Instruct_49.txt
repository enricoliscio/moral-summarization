SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the international space station encountered a snag during the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit. The problem, blamed on weightlessness, caused the one-ton railcar to float slightly off the rail, disrupting the automatic latching system. Despite the hiccup, NASA engineers remain optimistic, saying the issue is not a "nuisance" yet and can be addressed with software adjustments if needed. The $190 million railcar, essential for transporting the space station's 58-foot robot arm, will eventually be used in the next stages of the station's construction. The "snag" was quickly resolved, and the railcar continued its journey, albeit with manual control. As NASA manager Ben Sellari put it, "I think what we're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile transporter works in zero-g." The railcar's first use is set for late summer, and Atlantis' astronauts plan a fourth and final spacewalk to finish installing the girder.

END OF SUMMARY.
