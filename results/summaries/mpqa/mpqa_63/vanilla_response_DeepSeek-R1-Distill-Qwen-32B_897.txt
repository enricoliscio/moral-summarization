Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the space station's railcar. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about astronauts testing the new railcar on the International Space Station. The railcar didn't go as planned during its first run because it floated off the track a bit due to weightlessness. The magnetic sensors lost contact, causing it to stop. They had to manually control it each time it stopped, but eventually, it worked. The railcar is important for moving the robot arm around as more parts are added to the station. There's no risk of it falling off because of the rings on the girder. They plan to use it more in the future.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points. I should mention the issue with weightlessness, the manual intervention, the importance of the railcar, and the safety measures. Let me structure it step by step.

First, introduce the railcar test. Then mention the problem with weightlessness causing the sensors to lose contact. Next, explain how they had to manually control it each time. Then, talk about the purpose of the railcar and the safety features. Finally, note that the first use is planned for later.

I should keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Make sure it flows logically from the problem to the solution and the significance of the railcar.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, designed for moving the station's robot arm during construction, but encountered issues due to weightlessness. The railcar, worth $190 million, floated slightly off the track, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the aluminum tracks. Manual control was needed each time the automatic latching system failed. Despite the hiccups, the railcar successfully reached its destinations. Engineers may adjust software if problems persist, but the car is safe due to end rings on the 44-foot girder. The railcar's first full use is scheduled for late summer. END OF SUMMARY.
