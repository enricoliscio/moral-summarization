SUMMARY:
Astronauts encountered a slight problem during the inaugural run of the international space station's new railcar. NASA blamed the issue on weightlessness, suspecting that the one-ton car may have floated off the rail. This problem cropped up after the railcar moved down a short stretch of track, causing an interruption in the automatic latching system. Ground controllers had to intervene and take manual control to secure the car. The railcar's first use is planned for late summer and is essential for transporting the space station's robot arm during construction. Engineers believe the issue may be due to the car's movement in zero-g conditions. While there is no danger of the railcar rolling off the track, engineers may adjust the software if the issue becomes a nuisance. The space station astronaut, Carl Walz, successfully commanded the railcar to move back and forth along the track, but the automatic latching system shut down again, requiring manual intervention from ground controllers. The railcar's smooth operation is crucial for the upcoming stages of space station construction.
