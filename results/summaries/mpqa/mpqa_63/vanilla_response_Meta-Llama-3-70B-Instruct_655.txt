SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the International Space Station tested the new railcar, but it encountered a snag due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. The problem occurred after the empty flatcar moved 17 feet at a slow pace. Ground controllers took manual control to latch the railcar to the track, and the issue repeated itself twice more. Engineers believe the problem is related to how the mobile transporter works in zero-gravity and may adjust the computer software if it becomes a nuisance. There is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track due to rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder. The railcar is needed to transport the space station's robot arm as more girders are installed, with its first use set for late summer.

END OF SUMMARY.
