SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the International Space Station tested the new railcar, but it encountered a snag due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. The problem occurred twice, and ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car. Despite the issues, the railcar was able to move along the 44-foot girder, which was installed by the space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts last week. The railcar will be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during future construction stages. Engineers may adjust the computer software to address the issue, but there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track. The first use of the railcar is set for late summer.

END OF SUMMARY.
