Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the International Space Station's railcar. They also mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing from the original text. Hmm, I need to figure out what the moral framing is here. The article talks about the railcar encountering some issues during its test run. The main points are that it stopped working because of weightlessness causing the sensors to lose contact, and the engineers had to manually control it. But the story also shows that the astronauts and ground teams were able to solve the problem each time, which is a positive note. 

I should make sure the summary highlights both the technical issue and the successful troubleshooting. The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and to end with the specified tokens. I need to keep the language clear and straightforward, capturing the challenges faced and the resilience demonstrated by the team. Also, I should mention the future use of the railcar for transporting the robot arm, which shows the importance of the project despite the initial hiccups. 

Let me structure it: start with the problem, explain the cause, mention the solutions, and then the future implications. Make sure it flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll also need to include the key details like the cost of the railcar and the fact that it's the first permanent railroad in orbit. That should cover the main points while maintaining the moral aspect of overcoming challenges in space exploration.

SUMMARY:  
Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but faced issues due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the track, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the aluminum rails. Despite this, ground controllers manually controlled the car, successfully securing it at workstations. The railcar, designed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during future construction, halted three times during its test runs. NASA engineers may adjust software to address recurring issues, but the car remains safe due to end rings on the 44-foot girder. The first operational use is scheduled for late summer, highlighting the challenges and resilience of space exploration.  
END OF SUMMARY.
