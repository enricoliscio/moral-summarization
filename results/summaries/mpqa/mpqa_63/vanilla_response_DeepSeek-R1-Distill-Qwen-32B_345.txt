Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the International Space Station's railcar. They provided the article, so I need to read through it carefully to understand the main points. 

First, the article talks about the railcar's initial test run. It mentions that the railcar was sent rolling but encountered some issues. The problem was due to weightlessness causing the car to float off the track slightly, which made the magnetic sensors lose contact. That's an important detail because it shows the challenges of operating machinery in space.

The railcar is part of the space station's construction, so I should note that it's needed for moving the robot arm as more parts are added. The test involved moving the car along a 44-foot girder delivered by the shuttle Atlantis. The test had some hiccups, stopping at workstations and requiring manual control, but ultimately, it worked after interventions.

I also need to mention the cost of the railcar, which is $190 million, to give context about its significance. The engineers might adjust the software, but there's no danger of the railcar rolling off because of the rings on the girder. The next use is planned for late summer.

I should structure the summary to include the test run, the issues faced, the cause (weightlessness), the successful movement after manual control, the purpose of the railcar, its cost, safety measures, and future plans. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but cover all key points.

I'll start by stating the test run, then the problem, followed by the solution and implications. I'll make sure to mention the significance of the railcar for future construction. That should cover all necessary information succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered issues due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the track, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the aluminum tracks. Despite this, the railcar successfully moved to two workstations, with ground controllers taking manual control when the automatic latching system failed. Engineers may adjust the software, but the railcar is safe due to end rings on the 44-foot girder. The railcar, costing $190 million, is needed to transport the space station's robot arm during future construction. Its first use is scheduled for late summer.  
END OF SUMMARY.
