Alright, I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what they're asking for. The user provided a news article about the International Space Station's railcar having some issues during its test run. They also outlined two steps: identifying morally framed words and then summarizing the article while keeping those words.

Okay, so step one is to find all the single words that carry a moral tone. I'll go through the article and look for words that imply something positive or negative. Words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "float," "lose," "halt," "manual," "adjust," "nuisance," "danger," "needed," "plan," "finish," "install." These words seem to carry some moral weight, indicating issues, problems, or necessary actions.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The key points are the test run of the railcar, the issues faced due to weightlessness, the interventions by ground controllers, and the future plans. I should make sure to include the morally framed words identified earlier to maintain the original tone.

I'll start by mentioning the test run and the snag. Then, explain the problem with weightlessness causing the car to float off the track. Highlight the magnetic sensors losing contact, leading to halts. Mention the manual interventions and the successful completion of the test. Note the engineer's comments about learning how the system works in zero-g and the possible software adjustments. Also, include the safety measures and future plans for the railcar's use.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft it. I think I covered all the important points while preserving the moral framing. The summary should accurately reflect the article's content and the underlying issues highlighted by the author.

**STEP 1:**  
* snag  
* problem  
* blame  
* float  
* lose  
* halt  
* manual  
* adjust  
* nuisance  
* danger  
* needed  
* plan  
* finish  
* install  

**SUMMARY:**  
The International Space Station's new railcar encountered a snag during its inaugural test run, with NASA attributing the issue to weightlessness causing the car to float slightly off the track. Magnetic sensors lost contact with the track's iron strips, halting the car's movement. Ground controllers manually intervened to secure the railcar, and astronauts successfully restarted the test, though the automatic latching system shut down again. Engineers may adjust the software if the issue persists. Despite the hiccups, the railcar is needed to transport the station's robot arm during future construction phases. The $190 million railcar remains safe due to end rings on the track. The first operational use is planned for late summer. END OF SUMMARY.
