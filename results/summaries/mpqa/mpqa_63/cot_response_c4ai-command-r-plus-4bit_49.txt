SUMMARY: 
Astronauts encountered a *problem* during the inaugural run of the international space station's new railcar. The railcar, worth $190 million, floated slightly off the track due to *weightlessness*, according to NASA. Engineers *suspect* that the one-ton car lost contact with the magnetic sensors on the track, causing a *snag* that *interrupted* its movement. The railcar's automatic latching system *halted*, and ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car. NASA managers attributed the issue to the unique challenges of operating in zero-g conditions and assured that there was no *danger* of the railcar rolling off the track. The railcar is a crucial component for the upcoming stages of space station construction, and its first use is planned for late summer. Despite the *blame* and minor setbacks, astronauts successfully completed the railcar's initial test run, and space station astronaut Carl Walz was able to command the car to move back and forth along the track. The final spacewalk is scheduled for today to finish installing the necessary girders.
END OF SUMMARY.
