SUMMARY:
The international space station's new railcar encountered a snag on its inaugural run, interrupting its journey due to weightlessness. NASA blamed the issue on the car floating slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips. Engineers suspect this problem will be a nuisance in the future, but adjustments to the computer software may be made to resolve the issue. Despite the setbacks, the railcar was able to move slowly down the track, albeit with manual control. The $190 million railcar is a crucial component for the space station's construction, and its first use is set for late summer. The railcar will transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are installed. END OF SUMMARY.
