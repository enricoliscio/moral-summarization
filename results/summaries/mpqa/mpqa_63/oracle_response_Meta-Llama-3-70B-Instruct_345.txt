SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the international space station faced a snag on Monday when they tried to test the new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail due to weightlessness, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. This interruption was a nuisance, but NASA engineers blamed it on the challenges of working in zero-gravity. Despite the hiccup, the railcar was able to move slowly down the 44-foot girder, eventually coming to a halt and requiring manual control to secure it. The automatic latching system shut down again, but engineers are not worried, citing the safety rings on both ends of the girder that prevent the $190 million railcar from rolling off the track. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's robot arm as more girders are installed. The issue is not a danger, but rather a learning experience in working with mobile transporters in zero-g.

END OF SUMMARY.
