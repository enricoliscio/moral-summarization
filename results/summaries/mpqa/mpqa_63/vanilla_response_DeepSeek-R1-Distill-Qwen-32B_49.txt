Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the space station's railcar. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening. 

The article says that astronauts tested the new railcar on the International Space Station. It was supposed to be the first permanent railroad in space. They started moving the railcar, but it hit a snag. NASA thinks it's because of weightlessness causing the car to float off the track a bit, which made the magnetic sensors lose contact. 

The railcar stopped after moving 17 feet and wouldn't latch automatically. Controllers had to take manual control. Then they tried moving it again, and the same problem happened at another station. They did a third test, and again the automatic latching failed. 

NASA's manager mentioned that this is helping them understand how the system works in zero gravity. They might adjust the software if needed. The railcar is safe because of rings on the girder. The first use is planned for late summer, and the railcar is needed to move the robot arm during construction. The astronauts are doing a final spacewalk to finish installing the girder.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the test, the problem with weightlessness, the manual intervention, the need for software adjustments, safety measures, and future plans. I'll make sure it's concise and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered issues due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the track, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact. After moving 17 feet, the car stopped and failed to latch automatically, requiring manual control. Further tests showed the same problem, with ground controllers intervening each time. NASA noted the challenges of operating in zero gravity and may adjust software if necessary. The railcar is safe due to end rings on the 44-foot girder. It will be used to transport the station's robot arm during future construction. Astronauts completed the final spacewalk to install the girder. END OF SUMMARY.
