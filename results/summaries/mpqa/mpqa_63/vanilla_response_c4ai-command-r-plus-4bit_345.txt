SUMMARY: Astronauts on the International Space Station conducted the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered a problem due to weightlessness. The railcar, worth $190 million, floated slightly off the track, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. NASA engineers suspect that the weightlessness of space caused the issue. Despite the setback, the railcar was eventually secured to the track manually by ground controllers. The railcar will be used to transport the station's robot arm during future construction stages. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer. During the test, the railcar moved at a slow pace of less than a half-inch per second and was automatically latching itself down when the issue occurred. The railcar is part of a 44-foot girder that was delivered and installed by the crew of the space shuttle Atlantis. Astronaut Carl Walz commanded the railcar's movements and, despite the problems with latching, the railcar reached its intended destinations successfully. Engineers may adjust the software to improve performance.
END OF SUMMARY.
