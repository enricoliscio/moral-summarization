SUMMARY:

In a setback for the international space station's construction, the inaugural run of its new railcar was interrupted due to a snag caused by weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing its magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. Despite the issue, the railcar was able to move slowly down the track, but required manual control to latch itself back onto the track. NASA engineers suspect that adjustments to the computer software may be necessary to overcome this challenge. However, there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track due to safety rings on both ends of the girder. The railcar is crucial for transporting the space station's robot arm as more girders are installed, with its first use set for late summer. This minor hiccup serves as a reminder of the complexities of working in zero-gravity environments.

END OF SUMMARY.
