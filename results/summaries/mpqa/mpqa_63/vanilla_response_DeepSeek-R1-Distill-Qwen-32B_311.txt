Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the International Space Station's railcar. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about astronauts testing the new railcar on the space station. They tried moving it, but it ran into some issues. NASA says it's because of weightlessness causing the car to float slightly off the track, which messed up the magnetic sensors. The railcar is part of the station's construction, and it's supposed to move along a 44-foot girder installed by the shuttle Atlantis.

The initial test went okay for 17 feet, but then it stopped and wouldn't latch automatically. Ground controllers had to take over. They tried moving it again, and it went smoothly for 26 feet, but the same problem happened. They did a third test, and the same issue occurred. The manager mentioned that they're learning how the transporter works in zero gravity and that they might adjust the software later. There's no risk of the railcar falling off because of the end rings. The first use is planned for late summer, and the railcar will help move the robot arm as more girders are added. The astronauts are doing their last spacewalk today.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main events: the test, the issues with the magnetic sensors due to weightlessness, the need for manual control, the manager's comments, the safety measures, and the future use of the railcar. I'll make sure to mention the successful movement despite the latching issues and the upcoming first use.

Let me structure it: start with the test, mention the problem, explain why it happened, how they resolved it each time, the manager's thoughts, safety measures, and the future plans. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, encountering issues due to weightlessness causing the car to float off the track and disrupting magnetic sensors. The railcar, part of the station's construction, moved 17 feet initially but halted, requiring manual control. Subsequent tests showed similar latching problems, though movement was smooth. NASA manager Ben Sellari noted the need to adapt to zero-gravity conditions and possible software adjustments. The railcar, secured by end rings, is safe. Its first use is planned for late summer to transport the station's robot arm. Astronauts completed their final spacewalk. END OF SUMMARY.
