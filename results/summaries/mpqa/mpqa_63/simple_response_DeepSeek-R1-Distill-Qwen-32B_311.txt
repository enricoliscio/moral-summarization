Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the International Space Station's new railcar having some issues during its initial test run. The problem was due to weightlessness causing the car to float off the track slightly, which affected the magnetic sensors. 

The user wants the summary to be under 200 words and to include the moral framing. The article highlights the challenges of operating in zero gravity and the adaptability needed by engineers. So, the moral here is about learning and adapting in complex environments. 

I should structure the summary to mention the test run, the problem encountered, the cause, and the solution. Also, include that the system worked but needed adjustments, emphasizing the learning process. I'll make sure to highlight that the railcar is crucial for future construction and that it's a step forward despite the hiccups. 

Let me make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. I'll start by stating the test run, mention the snag, explain the cause, how they fixed it, and conclude with the significance of the railcar for future missions. That should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral aspect of learning and adapting in space operations.

SUMMARY:  
Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered issues due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the track, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the aluminum tracks. Despite this, the railcar successfully completed its initial runs with manual adjustments by ground controllers. Engineers may tweak the software if needed, but the system is deemed safe with end rings preventing the car from rolling off. The railcar is crucial for transporting the space station's 58-foot robot arm during future construction phases. The incident highlights the challenges of operating in zero gravity and the adaptability required for space operations.
