Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to identify the morally framed words in the article and then craft a summary that includes those words.

Looking at the article, the main issue is the railcar's problem during its test run. The key morally framed words I notice are "problem," "snag," "failed," "automatic," "latching," "manual," "adjust," "nuisance," "danger," "safe," "needed," and "critical." These words highlight the challenges faced and the importance of the mission.

Now, I need to write a concise summary. I should mention the initial problem, the cause (weightlessness causing the car to float off the rail), the attempts to fix it manually, and the implications for future operations. It's important to include the assurance that there's no danger and the necessity of the railcar for the space station's expansion.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the identified morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating the problem, then explain the cause and the steps taken to resolve it, and conclude with the significance of the railcar for ongoing construction.

**STEP 1:**  
* problem  
* snag  
* failed  
* automatic  
* latching  
* manual  
* adjust  
* nuisance  
* danger  
* safe  
* needed  
* critical  

**SUMMARY:**  
Astronauts encountered a problem during the inaugural run of the International Space Station's new railcar, which floated slightly off the track due to weightlessness. The automatic latching system failed twice, requiring manual intervention by ground controllers. Despite the snag, the railcar eventually reached its destination. Engineers suspect the issue may be due to the effects of zero-gravity and may adjust the computer software if it becomes a nuisance. There is no danger of the railcar rolling off the track, as it is secured by rings on the girder. The railcar is critical for transporting the space station's robot arm during future construction phases. The first operational use is scheduled for late summer.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
