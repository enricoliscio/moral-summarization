Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the International Space Station's railcar issue, preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that the assistant is a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The railcar had some issues during its test run, specifically due to weightlessness causing it to float off the track. The problem was with the magnetic sensors losing contact. NASA's engineers had to manually control the car each time it stopped. The article also mentions that this is the first permanent railroad in orbit and its importance for future construction stages. The author used words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "hitch," "nuisance," and "smoothly." 

I need to make sure the summary includes these morally framed words. I'll start by highlighting the snag and the problem, then explain the cause due to weightlessness. Mention the engineers' manual intervention each time, and note that it's a minor hitch. Include the fact that the system shut down again and the need for adjustments. Also, mention the safety measures in place and the future plans for the railcar. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is preserved. 

I should structure it to first state the issue, then the cause, followed by the solutions and future implications. Make sure to include the specific details like the distance moved and the safety rings. End with the positive note about the railcar's future use. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral elements the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered a snag due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the track's iron strips. Engineers manually controlled the car each time it halted, and the system shut down again during subsequent tests. NASA manager Ben Sellari noted that the issue highlights how the mobile transporter operates in zero gravity, suggesting potential software adjustments if it becomes a nuisance. The $190 million railcar is crucial for transporting the station's robot arm during future construction. Safety rings on the 44-foot girder prevent the car from rolling off, and its first operational use is planned for late summer. The tests revealed minor hitches, but the railcar ultimately performed as intended, with ground controllers ensuring its secure latching each time. END OF SUMMARY.
