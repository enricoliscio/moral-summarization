SUMMARY:
Astronauts on the international space station encountered a snag during the inaugural run of the new railcar, which is part of the first permanent railroad in orbit. The problem arose due to weightlessness, causing the one-ton car to float slightly off the rail, resulting in the magnetic sensors losing contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. NASA engineers blame the issue on the unique conditions of zero-gravity. Despite the fault, the railcar was able to move slowly down the track, albeit with manual intervention. Fortunately, there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track due to safety rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during the next stages of construction. Engineers may adjust the computer software to prevent future nuisances. END OF SUMMARY.
