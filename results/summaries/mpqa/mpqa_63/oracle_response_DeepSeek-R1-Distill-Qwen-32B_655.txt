Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used certain morally framed words, so I should identify those first. 

Looking at the article, words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "interrupted," "nuisance," and "danger" seem to carry a moral tone. These words imply issues, challenges, and potential risks, which are part of the moral framing.

Now, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The space station's railcar had some issues during its first run. It stopped due to weightlessness affecting the sensors. NASA and engineers are working on fixing the software. The railcar is crucial for future construction, and there's a safety measure in place to prevent it from rolling off.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the problems encountered, NASA's response, and the importance of the railcar. Also, I'll retain the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

Let me structure the summary: start with the initial problem, mention the cause (weightlessness), the interruptions, the manual intervention, and the future plans. I'll ensure the moral terms are included to reflect the challenges and solutions.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's concise and within the limit. Making sure all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit, but encountered issues due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing magnetic sensors to lose contact with the tracks. Despite manual interventions by ground controllers, the automatic latching system failed twice during the test runs. NASA engineers suspect software adjustments may be needed if the problem persists. The railcar, valued at $190 million, is essential for transporting the space station's robot arm during future construction. Safety measures, including end rings on the track, prevent the car from rolling off. The first operational use of the railcar is scheduled for late summer. END OF SUMMARY.
