Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand what the user is asking for. They provided a news article about the International Space Station's railcar having some issues during its initial test run. The user wants me to identify the morally framed words and then write a summary that includes those words.

First, I'll read through the article to find the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation. From the article, I can see words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "floated," "snail's pace," "halt," "manual control," " nuisance," "danger," "needed," and "installed." These words convey issues, challenges, and necessary actions, which add a moral or evaluative angle to the events.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The summary should be under 200 words and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: the railcar's test run had issues, NASA identified the cause as weightlessness, the car floated off the track, sensors lost contact, the system halted, manual control was used, the problem happened again, engineers might adjust software, no danger due to safety rings, and the railcar's first use is planned for later.

I'll make sure to include the morally framed words in the summary without making it too long. I should also maintain the flow and clarity of the summary, ensuring it accurately reflects the article's content while preserving the moral elements.

**STEP 1:**  
* snag  
* problem  
* blame  
* floated  
* sensors  
* contact  
* strips  
* track  
* interrupted  
* inaugural  
* construction  
* delivered  
* bolted  
* halted  
* manual control  
* latching  
* nuisance  
* danger  
* rings  
* needed  
* installed  

**SUMMARY:**  
The International Space Station's new railcar encountered issues during its initial test run, with NASA attributing the problem to weightlessness causing the car to float slightly off the track. Magnetic sensors lost contact with the track, halting the automatic latching system. Ground controllers took manual control to secure the car, and the test was completed successfully. Engineers may adjust the software if the issue persists, but there is no danger of the railcar rolling off due to safety rings. The railcar is needed to transport the space station's robot arm during future construction phases. The first use is planned for late summer.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
