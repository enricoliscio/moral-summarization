SUMMARY:
Astronauts on the international space station encountered a snag when testing the new railcar, which is part of the first permanent railroad in orbit. The problem arose due to weightlessness, causing the one-ton car to float slightly off the rail and lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. NASA blamed the issue on weightlessness. Despite the setback, engineers were able to manually control the railcar and get it moving again. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during the next stages of construction. While the automatic latching system shut down again, engineers may adjust the computer software to prevent it from becoming a nuisance. Fortunately, there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track. The first use of the railcar is set for late summer.
END OF SUMMARY.
