SUMMARY: Astronauts encountered a minor setback during the inaugural run of the international space station's new railcar system. The railcar, designed to transport the station's robot arm during construction, floated slightly off the track due to weightlessness, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. NASA engineers suspect that the weightlessness of space caused the one-ton car to float, resulting in the disruption. Despite the issue, the railcar was able to move down the track and reach its designated work stations. However, ground controllers had to manually intervene to secure the car at each station. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer, and it will play a crucial role in the space station's ongoing construction. The railcar system, valued at $190 million, is the first permanent railroad in orbit and is expected to facilitate the installation of additional girders. Atlantis astronauts are scheduled to complete the installation during their fourth and final spacewalk.
END OF SUMMARY.
