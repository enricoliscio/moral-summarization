SUMMARY: Astronauts onboard the International Space Station successfully tested a new railcar system designed to move equipment along a 44-foot girder. The railcar, valued at $190 million, experienced some initial difficulties due to the weightless environment of space, causing the car to float slightly off the track and disrupt the magnetic sensors. Despite these issues, the railcar was able to move down the track and stop at designated work stations. Ground controllers assisted by taking manual control and latching the railcar to the track. The railcar will be used to transport the station's 58-foot robot arm during future construction stages. Engineers may adjust the software to prevent further issues with the automatic latching system. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer. This test marks a significant milestone in the assembly of the International Space Station, providing a unique transportation system in orbit.
