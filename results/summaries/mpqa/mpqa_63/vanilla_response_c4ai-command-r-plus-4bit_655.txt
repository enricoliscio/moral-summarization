SUMMARY: Astronauts on the International Space Station attempted to test a new railcar system, designed to transport equipment and supplies along a 44-foot girder recently installed by the crew of the space shuttle Atlantis. However, the railcar encountered a problem during its inaugural run, likely due to weightlessness causing it to float slightly off the track. NASA engineers suspect the magnetic sensors on the bottom of the car lost contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. The issue interrupted the automatic latching system, requiring ground controllers to take manual control and secure the car. Despite the challenges, the railcar eventually completed its test run, moving back and forth along the track. The railcar is a significant component of the space station's construction, enabling the transport of the station's 58-foot robot arm as new girders are installed. The first operational use of the railcar is planned for late summer.
END OF SUMMARY.
