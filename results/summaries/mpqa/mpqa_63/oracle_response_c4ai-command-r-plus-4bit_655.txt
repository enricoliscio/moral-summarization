SUMMARY: Astronauts encountered a slight snag during the inaugural run of the international space station's new railcar, the first permanent railroad in orbit. The one-ton car, valued at $190 million, floated ever so slightly off the track due to weightlessness, causing magnetic sensors on the bottom of the car to lose contact with iron strips in the aluminum tracks. Despite the issue, the railcar will play a crucial role in the space station's construction, transporting the 58-foot robot arm as more girders are installed. The problem first arose as the car moved slowly down 17 feet of track, coming to a halt as it tried to latch itself automatically to the work station. Thankfully, ground controllers were able to take manual control and latch the railcar to the track. Further attempts encountered similar issues, but the railcar eventually completed its journey back and forth along the 44-foot girder. NASA managers attributed the issues to the unique challenges of operating in zero-gravity and assured that there was no danger of the railcar rolling off the track. Engineers may consider software adjustments if the problem persists. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer, showcasing human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of challenges.
END OF SUMMARY.
