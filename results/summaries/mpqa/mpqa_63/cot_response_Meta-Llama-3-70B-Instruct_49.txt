SUMMARY:
Astronauts on the international space station encountered a snag when testing the new railcar, which is a crucial component for the outpost's construction. The problem arose due to weightlessness, causing the one-ton car to float slightly off the rail and lose contact with the iron strips. NASA engineers blamed the issue on the unique conditions of zero-gravity. Despite the setback, the railcar was able to move slowly down the track, albeit with manual control from ground controllers. The automatic latching system shut down multiple times, but there was no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track. Engineers may adjust the computer software to prevent the nuisance from becoming a bigger issue. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's robot arm as more girders are installed. END OF SUMMARY.
