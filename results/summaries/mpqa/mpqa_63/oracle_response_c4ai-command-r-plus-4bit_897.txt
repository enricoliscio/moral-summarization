SUMMARY: Astronauts aboard the International Space Station encountered a slight hiccup during the inaugural run of the first-ever orbital railroad. The issue, blamed on the weightlessness of space, caused a brief interruption but was swiftly addressed by ground controllers who took manual control and secured the railcar to the track. Despite the setback, the railcar's movement along the 44-foot girder was a significant milestone, marking the beginning of a new era in space station construction. The $190 million railcar is an essential component in transporting the station's 58-foot robot arm during future expansion stages. While the automatic latching system encountered issues, NASA managers assured that there was no danger of the railcar rolling off the track. The problem was attributed to the unique challenges of operating in zero-g conditions. Engineers may adjust the software in the future if necessary. The railcar's first use is planned for late summer, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of NASA's space program in overcoming the obstacles of working in space.
END OF SUMMARY.
