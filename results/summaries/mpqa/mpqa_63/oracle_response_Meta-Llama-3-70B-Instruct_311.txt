SUMMARY:

The international space station's new railcar, a $190 million investment, hit a snag on its inaugural run due to the challenges of weightlessness. Engineers suspect the one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. Despite the setbacks, NASA remained optimistic, with manager Ben Sellari saying, "I think what we're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile transporter works in zero-g." The automatic latching system shut down twice, requiring ground controllers to step in and secure the car. However, there is no danger of the railcar rolling off the track due to safety rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder. The railcar will eventually be used to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm during the next stages of construction. The issue may be addressed through software adjustments, but for now, it's a minor nuisance. The railcar's first use is set for late summer.

END OF SUMMARY.
