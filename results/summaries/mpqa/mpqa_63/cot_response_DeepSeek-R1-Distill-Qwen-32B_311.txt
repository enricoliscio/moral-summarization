Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "snag," "problem," "blamed," "snag," "float," "lose contact," "stopped," "automatically latching," "halt," "manual control," "smoothly," "same thing," "danger," "adjust," "nuisance," "safe," "needed," "installing," "finish," and "final." These words seem to carry some moral weight, indicating issues, blame, or safety concerns.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include those morally framed words. The article is about the space station's railcar having some issues during its test run. The main points are the initial problem with the railcar floating off track, the intervention by ground controllers, the repeated issues with the latching system, the safety measures in place, and the future plans for the railcar.

I should structure the summary to highlight the problems faced, the corrective actions taken, and the implications for future operations. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the original tone.

Now, putting it all together, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the key points and the identified moral words. I'll end with the specified tokens to indicate the start and end of the summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
Astronauts tested the International Space Station's new railcar, but it encountered a snag during its inaugural run. NASA blamed the issue on weightlessness, which caused the one-ton car to float slightly off the rail, disrupting its magnetic sensors. The railcar stopped at a workstation and halted automatically, requiring ground controllers to manually latch it. Despite adjustments, the same problem occurred again, with the automatic latching system shutting down. Engineers may tweak the software if the issue persists, but the railcar is safe due to end rings on the girder. The railcar is needed to transport the station's robot arm during future construction. Astronauts completed the final spacewalk to install the girder, with the first use of the railcar planned for late summer. END OF SUMMARY.
