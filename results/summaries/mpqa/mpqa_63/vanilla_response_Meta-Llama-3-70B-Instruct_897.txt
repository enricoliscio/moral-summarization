SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the International Space Station tested the new railcar on Monday, but it encountered a snag due to weightlessness. The one-ton car floated slightly off the rail, causing the magnetic sensors to lose contact with the iron strips in the aluminum tracks. The problem occurred three times, and ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car. Despite the issue, the railcar was able to move along the 44-foot girder, which was delivered and bolted to the space station by the space shuttle Atlantis last week. Engineers suspect that adjustments to the computer software may be needed in the future. The railcar is crucial for the space station's construction, as it will be used to transport the 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other. The first use of the railcar is scheduled for late summer.
