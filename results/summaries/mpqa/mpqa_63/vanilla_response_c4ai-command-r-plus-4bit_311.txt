SUMMARY: Astronauts conducted the first test of a railcar system on the International Space Station, encountering a minor issue where the railcar floated slightly off the track due to weightlessness. NASA engineers suspect that the one-ton car lost contact with the magnetic sensors on the track, causing the system to halt. Despite the issue, ground controllers were able to manually latch the railcar to the track and resume testing. The railcar moved smoothly along the 44-foot girder, but the automatic latching system did not function as intended. The railcar is an important component for the future construction of the space station, as it will transport the station's 58-foot robot arm. The first use of the railcar is planned for late summer. Engineers may adjust the software to improve the latching system if it continues to be a problem. The railcar test was conducted during the final spacewalk of the Atlantis shuttle mission, where astronauts installed the girder for the railcar track.
END OF SUMMARY.
