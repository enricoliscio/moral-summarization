SUMMARY:
The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, with many arguing that they deserve humane treatment, despite being "thugs". The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star believe that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. However, The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, arguing that treating the prisoners differently could "imperil" American lives. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of "betrayal" and being "flighty" and "opportunistic". In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised as "sensible", "serious", and "scrupulously honest". END OF SUMMARY.
