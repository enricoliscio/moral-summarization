SUMMARY: The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay has sparked a moral debate among editorial writers and pundits. The Ottawa Citizen argues that even thugs deserve humane treatment and that Canada should insist the US allow a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. This would ensure that laws keep us from behaving like them. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the US treatment, citing concerns that treating prisoners differently might imperil American lives. Meanwhile, the sudden departure of Brian Tobin from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of betrayal and ridiculing his claims of leaving for family reasons. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a sensible, serious, and honest leader who has proven himself trustworthy. END OF SUMMARY.
