SUMMARY: The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian editorial writers and pundits, with some arguing for humane treatment and a UN tribunal, while others support the U.S.'s tough stance. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a 'competent tribunal' to determine the legal status of detainees, citing the Geneva Convention and the importance of upholding laws, even in the face of a conflict with Osama bin Laden. In contrast, The Daily Press believes that overreacting to the treatment of captured fighters might imperil American lives. The sudden departure of Brian Tobin, a former politician, has also drawn criticism for his betrayal of voters and opportunistic behavior. Pundits save their praise for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, highlighting his competence, honesty, and sensible management during the Sept. 11 crisis.
