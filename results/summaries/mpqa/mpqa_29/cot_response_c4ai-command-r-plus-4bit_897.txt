SUMMARY:
The treatment of al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian pundits and editorial writers, with some arguing for humane treatment and a 'competent tribunal' to determine their legal status, while others support the U.S.'s harsh approach. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's abrupt departure from politics has been met with criticism and ridicule, with writers characterizing his decision as a betrayal of voters and his career as unstable and opportunistic. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a sensible, serious, and scrupulously honest leader who emerged as a voice of reason during the Sept. 11 crisis. Tobin's departure and Manley's elevation highlight the stark contrast between the two politicians' reputations and the Canadian public's response to their actions.
