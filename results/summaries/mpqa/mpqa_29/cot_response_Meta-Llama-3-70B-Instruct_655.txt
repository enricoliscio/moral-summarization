SUMMARY:
The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that even "thugs" deserve "humane" treatment and that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the US, claiming that treating the prisoners differently might "imperil" American lives. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many labeling him "flighty", "opportunistic", and "lacking" in commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is hailed as "sensible", "serious", "competent", and "scrupulously honest". END OF SUMMARY.
