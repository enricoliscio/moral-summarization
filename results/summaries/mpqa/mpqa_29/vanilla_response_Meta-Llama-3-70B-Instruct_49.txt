SUMMARY:

The article discusses the opinions of editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa regarding the departure of Brian Tobin from politics and the treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. While Tobin's departure has been met with criticism, with many calling him "flighty" and "opportunistic", John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible manager" who Canadians can trust. On the issue of Guantanamo Bay, some editorial writers argue that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention, while others believe the US is justified in its treatment of the prisoners. The article highlights the differing opinions on these two topics among editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa.
