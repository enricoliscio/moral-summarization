SUMMARY: There has been much debate among editorial writers and pundits in Canada's capital regarding the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the recent Cabinet shuffle that saw the departure of Brian Tobin. While some, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, advocate for humane treatment and a UN tribunal for the prisoners, others, like The Daily Press, worry that overreacting and treating them too gently might imperil American lives. As for Mr. Tobin, his sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism and ridicule, with many seeing it as a betrayal of voters. Columnists have been quick to point out his unstable career and opportunistic nature. In contrast, the new Deputy Prime Minister, John Manley, has been praised for his sensible and honest management during the Sept. 11 crisis, with pundits expressing confidence in his ability to handle national security and his new role.
