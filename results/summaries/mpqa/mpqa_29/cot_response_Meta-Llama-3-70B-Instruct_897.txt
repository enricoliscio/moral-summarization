SUMMARY:
The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa. The Ottawa Citizen argues that "even thugs deserve humane treatment" and calls for a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. treatment of the prisoners, citing concerns for American lives. Meanwhile, former minister Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many labeling him "flighty", "opportunistic", and "lacking in commitment". In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is hailed as "sensible", "serious", and "scrupulously honest". END OF SUMMARY.
