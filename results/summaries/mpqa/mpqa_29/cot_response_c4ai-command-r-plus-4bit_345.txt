SUMMARY:
The treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics have sparked debate among Canadian editorial writers and pundits. While some argue for the humane treatment of al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, others believe that the U.S. military's harsh conditions are justified. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a competent tribunal to determine the legal status of detainees, citing the Geneva Convention and the importance of upholding laws that distinguish us from "thugs." Conversely, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S., fearing that treating prisoners differently may imperil American lives.

The sudden exit of Brian Tobin, former MP and minister, is met with criticism and ridicule. Tobin's departure is framed as a "betrayal of voters," with columnist Walter Robinson alluding to his "instability" and "opportunism." Rosa Harris-Adler sarcastically targets Tobin's family reasons, while Michel Vastel bids farewell to his "favourite Newfie," noting Tobin's rocky political career marked by highs and lows. 

Amidst the criticism, praise is bestowed upon John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister. Editorial writers describe Manley as a "sensible" and "serious" voice in Cabinet, with the Ottawa Citizen commending his competence and scrupulous honesty. His elevation bodes well for the country's national security and leadership.
