SUMMARY:

The editorial writers in Ottawa have been weighing in on the plight of prisoners and politicians. The treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked controversy, with some arguing that even thugs deserve humane treatment. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. treatment, fearing that any differently might imperil American lives.

Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has provoked vitriol from pundits, who see it as his third consecutive betrayal of voters. Columnists ridicule his assertion that he left for family reasons, portraying him as flighty, opportunistic, and lacking in commitment to his job. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is hailed as a sensible, serious voice in Cabinet, who has proven to be a competent and scrupulously honest manager.
