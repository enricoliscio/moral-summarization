Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley. The moral aspects are evident in the treatment of prisoners and the criticism of Tobin's actions.

First, I'll identify the key points about the prisoners. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star emphasize humane treatment and the need for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. approach, arguing against overreacting and potential endangerment of American lives. I should include words like "humane," "treatment," "conflict," and "overreacting."

Next, regarding Brian Tobin, the article highlights his departure and the betrayal felt by the public. Columnists ridicule his reasons for leaving and question his commitment. Words like "betrayal," "ridiculing," and "proven" (as in Manley's honesty) are important here.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral terms as possible. I'll structure it to first address the Guantanamo issue, then move on to Tobin's departure and Manley's ascension, using the moral words to frame each section.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each point is clear and the moral language is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral implications of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure. Editorial writers argue that "humane treatment" of prisoners is essential, with the Ottawa Citizen emphasizing the need for a "competent tribunal" under the Geneva Convention. Meanwhile, the Daily Press supports the U.S. approach, suggesting critics may be "overreacting" and risking American lives. The conflict over how to "treat" these prisoners highlights the tension between security and legal obligations.  

Turning to politics, Tobin's sudden exit has sparked criticism, with commentators accusing him of "betrayal" and "ridiculing" his claims of leaving for family reasons. His career is described as "unstable" and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley is praised as "competent" and "scrupulously honest," emerging as a trusted leader. The moral framing underscores the importance of accountability, honesty, and humane values in both domestic and international contexts. END OF SUMMARY.
