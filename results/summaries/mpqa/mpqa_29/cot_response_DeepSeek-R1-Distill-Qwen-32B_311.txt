Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to understand what they're asking for. They want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to summarize the article while preserving those moral framings.

Hmm, let me break this down. The article talks about two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley. The moral framing is evident in how the authors present their opinions on these issues.

For the first part, I need to find all the words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "controversial," "harsh," "inhumane," "assurances," "insist," "overreacting," "betrayal," "unstable," "flighty," "opportunistic," "lacking in commitment," "sensible," "trust," "competent," "scrupulously honest," and "bodes well." These words show the authors' judgments on the actions and characters involved.

Now, for the summary, I have to make sure to include as many of these moral words as possible without making it too long. I need to capture the essence of the article, highlighting the differing opinions on the prisoners' treatment and the criticism of Tobin versus the praise for Manley.

I should structure the summary to first address the al-Qaeda prisoners' issue, mentioning the moral concerns and the support for U.S. actions. Then, I'll move on to the political aspect, detailing the criticism towards Tobin and the positive reception of Manley. I'll keep it concise, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

Wait, I should also make sure that the summary doesn't just list the points but connects them logically. Maybe start by introducing the two main topics, then delve into each, using the moral terms to show the authors' stances.

I think I've got a good grasp on this. Time to put it all together, making sure to hit all the key points and maintain the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**  
The news article discusses the moral and political implications of two main issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure from Canadian politics. Editorial writers debate whether the harsh conditions for detainees, such as wire-mesh cells and minimal amenities, are inhumane, with some arguing that Canada should insist on a tribunal to address their legal status under the Geneva Convention. Others, however, support the U.S. actions, claiming that treating prisoners differently could imperil American lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's sudden exit is met with criticism, with pundits labeling his actions as a betrayal of voters and describing his career as unstable and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised as competent, honest, and trustworthy, with his leadership seen as a positive development for national security. END OF SUMMARY.
