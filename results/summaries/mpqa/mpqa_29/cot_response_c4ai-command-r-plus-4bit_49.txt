SUMMARY:
The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the recent Cabinet shuffle that saw the departure of Brian Tobin. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star editorials argue that the conditions for detainees are harsh and that Canada should insist on a 'competent tribunal' to decide their legal status, in accordance with the Geneva Convention. They believe that even "thugs" deserve humane treatment and that following laws keeps us from behaving like them. On the other hand, The Daily Press editorial from Timmins disagrees, suggesting that overreacting to the treatment of captured fighters might imperil American lives.

Turning to domestic politics, the sudden departure of Brian Tobin has been met with criticism. Tobin has been accused of betraying voters and his commitment as an MP has been questioned. His reasons for leaving, citing family, have been ridiculed. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has received overwhelming praise from editorial boards. He is described as a sensible manager who has proven to be trustworthy during the Sept. 11 crisis. The Citizen editorial goes on to commend Manley for his competence and scrupulous honesty, highlighting his continuing responsibility for national security.
