SUMMARY: Canadian editorial writers and pundits weighed in on two pressing issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of politician Brian Tobin. Regarding the prisoners, the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocated for a UN tribunal to determine their legal status, citing the Geneva Convention. The Daily Press, however, supported the US's handling of the prisoners, arguing that treating them differently could imperil American lives. As for Tobin, reactions to his departure were largely negative. He was criticized for betraying voters and his commitment to his job as an MP was questioned. Columnists mocked his stated reason for leaving politics, with one sarcastically imagining his struggles with fatherhood. Michel Vastel wrote a more personal goodbye, noting that Tobin made enemies and had an "unstable" career. The praise was reserved for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who was hailed as a sensible and trustworthy voice in Cabinet, with his elevation seen as boding well for the country.
