Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. The moral framing is evident in the differing opinions on whether the prisoners should be treated humanely and the criticism of Tobin's actions.

First, I'll focus on the al-Qaeda prisoners. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue for humane treatment and a tribunal under the Geneva Convention, emphasizing the importance of laws. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. treatment, fearing it might help Osama bin Laden. This shows a moral debate between legal obligations and practical security concerns.

Next, regarding Brian Tobin, the pundits are critical. He's accused of betraying voters and being unstable, with sarcastic comments about his post-political life. Meanwhile, John Manley is praised as competent and trustworthy, highlighting the contrast in their reputations.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects clear. I'll structure it by first addressing the Guantanamo issue, then Tobin's criticism, and finally Manley's praise.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures the moral viewpoints from each side. I'll make sure to include the key arguments and the contrasting opinions on both topics.

Now, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary flows logically, covering both main points without unnecessary details.
