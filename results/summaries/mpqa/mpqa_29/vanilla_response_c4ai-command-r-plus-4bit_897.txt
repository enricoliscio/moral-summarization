SUMMARY: The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin, as well as the issue of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that Canada should insist the U.S. allow a 'competent tribunal' to decide the legal status of the detainees, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. handling of the prisoners. As for Mr. Tobin, his sudden departure from politics has provoked much criticism, with columnists ridiculing his assertion that he left for family reasons. Michel Vastel writes that Mr. Tobin made too many enemies in Ottawa and had a career like a "rough sea." The praise, instead, has been saved for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who is described as a "sensible, serious voice in Cabinet" and "competent and scrupulously honest." END OF SUMMARY.
