SUMMARY:

The Canadian press has been abuzz with opinions on the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that even "thugs" deserve "humane treatment" and that Canada should insist on a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins believes that treating the prisoners any differently might "imperil American lives." Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of "betrayal" and "opportunism." Columnists have ridiculed his assertion that he left for family reasons, portraying him as unstable and untrustworthy. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for being "competent" and "scrupulously honest." END OF SUMMARY.
