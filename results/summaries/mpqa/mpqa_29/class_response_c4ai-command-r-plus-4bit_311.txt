SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Canada have weighed in on two pressing issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the recent departure of Brian Tobin from politics. Regarding the former, there are differing opinions on whether the U.S. is providing humane treatment to the detainees. While some argue that the conditions are harsh but necessary, others believe that a competent tribunal is needed to ensure their legal status is determined fairly and in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The latter issue has provoked criticism of Mr. Tobin, with columnists ridiculing his assertion that he left politics for family reasons and calling his political career a series of betrayals and instability. Meanwhile, praise has been heaped on John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, for his sensible and honest management during the Sept. 11 crisis.
