SUMMARY:

The editorial writers in Ottawa have been weighing in on the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, with many arguing that even thugs deserve humane treatment. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention, to ensure they are treated humanely. However, The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, suggesting that treating the prisoners differently could imperil American lives.

Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of betrayal and ridiculing his claim that he left for family reasons. Columnists have described him as "flighty, opportunistic, and lacking in commitment" to his job as an MP.

In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for being a "sensible manager who Canadians can trust" and "competent and scrupulously honest." His continued responsibility for national security is seen as a positive development for the country.
