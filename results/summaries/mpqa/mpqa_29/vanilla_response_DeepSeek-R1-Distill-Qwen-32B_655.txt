Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about editorials in various Canadian newspapers discussing two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley in Ottawa.

First, the article mentions that editorial writers are divided on the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that the prisoners should be treated humanely and suggest involving the UN or a tribunal. They believe this is important to maintain legal standards. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. approach, saying that changing the treatment might endanger American lives and that critics are overreacting.

Next, the article shifts focus to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. Many pundits are critical of him, calling him unstable and uncommitted. They don't shed tears for his exit, noting his betrayals and the rough nature of his political career. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised for his competence and trustworthiness, especially after the September 11 crisis.

So, to summarize, the article covers the differing opinions on the Guantanamo Bay prisoners' treatment and the mixed reactions to Tobin's exit and Manley's rise in politics. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the main points without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it by first addressing the al-Qaeda debate, then move on to the political shuffle, highlighting the criticism of Tobin and praise for Manley.

I should make sure to mention the key newspapers and their stances on the prisoners, the reasons given for their positions, and the impact on the conflict. Then, for the political part, I'll note the main criticisms of Tobin and the positive remarks about Manley. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting the two main topics discussed in the article.

I need to avoid including too many details, just the essential points. Maybe start with the debate over the prisoners, then transition to the political changes, highlighting the contrast in reactions towards Tobin and Manley. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me check if I have all the main elements: editorials on Guantanamo, differing opinions, impact on legal standards, Tobin's departure and criticism, Manley's praise. Yes, that covers the main points. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and contributes to the overall summary without unnecessary fluff.

Alright, I think I'm ready to put it all together into a coherent summary.
