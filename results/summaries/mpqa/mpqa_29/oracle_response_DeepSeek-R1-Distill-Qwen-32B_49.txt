Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics.

The article mentions several editorials. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue for humane treatment and the need for a tribunal, using words like "plight," "harsh," "treatment," "decide," "address," and "determine." The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S., saying that different treatment might "imperil" lives.

Then, the article shifts to Brian Tobin. He's criticized for his "antics" and "betrayal" of voters. Words like "unstable," "vitriol," "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking" are used to describe him. On the other hand, John Manley is praised with "sensible" and "serious."

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the moral terms as possible. I'll structure it by first addressing the al-Qaeda issue, then move to Tobin's criticism and Manley's praise.

I should start by mentioning the editorials' concerns about Guantanamo, using "plight," "harsh," "treatment," etc. Then note the Daily Press's counterargument. Next, discuss Tobin's "antics," "betrayal," and the negative adjectives used. Finally, mention Manley's positive traits.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms without being too wordy.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral concerns surrounding the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, emphasizing their "plight" and the "harsh" conditions they endure. Editorials argue that while the U.S. claims humane "treatment," independent "tribunals" are needed to "determine" their legal status under the Geneva Convention. Some pundits, however, believe such measures might "imperil" efforts to combat terrorism. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's abrupt departure from politics has sparked criticism, with pundits labeling his actions "antics" and accusing him of "betrayal" and "unstable" behavior. His reputation as a "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking" politician has drawn "vitriol." In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised as "sensible" and "serious," with his leadership seen as a positive development. END OF SUMMARY.
