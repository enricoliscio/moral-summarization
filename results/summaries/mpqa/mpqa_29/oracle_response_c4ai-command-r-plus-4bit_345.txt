SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the recent Cabinet shuffle that saw the departure of Brian Tobin and the elevation of John Manley. Opinions on the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners are divided, with some arguing for humane treatment and a 'competent tribunal' to decide their legal status, while others believe that the U.S. is justified in its harsh treatment of the detainees. As for Mr. Tobin, his sudden departure from politics has been criticized as a betrayal of voters, with pundits describing him as opportunistic and unstable. His antics in Ottawa have made him many enemies, and his flighty behavior has left a sour taste in the mouths of voters and colleagues alike. In contrast, Mr. Manley has been praised as a sensible and serious voice in Cabinet, with his elevation to Deputy Prime Minister seen as a positive step for the country. His competence and honesty are highlighted, and his continuing responsibility for national security is seen as a boon for Canada. END OF SUMMARY.
