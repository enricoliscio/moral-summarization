Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the task. The user provided a detailed news article and wants two things: first, to identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with the article, I see it's about editorials and pundits discussing two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley. The moral framing is evident in the language used, such as "thugs," "humane treatment," "betrayal," etc.

For STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out every single word that carries a moral connotation. I'll look for words that express approval, disapproval, or ethical considerations. Words like "controversial," "harsh," "inhumane," "betrayal," "unstable," "flighty," "opportunistic," and "dishonest" come to mind. I'll list each of these as they appear in the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise paragraph, making sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and should capture the essence of the editorials' arguments and the pundits' opinions on both the prisoners' treatment and the political figures involved.

I should structure the summary to first address the Guantanamo Bay issue, highlighting the differing opinions on whether the treatment is harsh but not necessarily inhumane versus the need for a tribunal. Then, I'll move on to the political aspect, discussing Brian Tobin's departure and the criticism he received, contrasting it with the praise for John Manley.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the moral stances presented in the original article. I'll make sure to include words like "controversial," "betrayal," "unstable," and "dishonest" to maintain the moral framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that it effectively captures the moral nuances discussed in the article.

### SUMMARY:  
The news article discusses the moral and political implications of two main issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure from Canadian politics. Editorial writers debate whether the harsh conditions for detainees, such as wire-mesh cells and limited facilities, are inhumane, with some advocating for a tribunal to address their legal status under the Geneva Convention. Others argue that criticizing U.S. treatment might imperil American lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's abrupt exit is met with criticism, with pundits calling his actions a betrayal of voters and describing his career as unstable. His replacement, John Manley, is praised as competent and honest, emerging as a trusted leader in the wake of the political shuffle. END OF SUMMARY.
