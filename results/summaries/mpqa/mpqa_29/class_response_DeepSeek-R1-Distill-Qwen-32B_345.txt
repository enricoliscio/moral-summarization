Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words: humane, treatment, conflict, overreacting, treat, imperil, betrayal, ridiculing, proven, honest. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article starts by mentioning the harsh conditions in Guantanamo Bay, emphasizing the need for humane treatment. Some editorial writers support the U.S., while others argue for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. I should note the differing opinions here.

Next, it talks about Brian Tobin's departure, with critics calling it a betrayal and ridiculing his reasons. John Manley is praised as competent and honest. I need to capture the negative sentiment towards Tobin and the positive towards Manley.

I'll structure the summary by first addressing the Guantanamo issue, then move on to Tobin and Manley. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral terms are included naturally.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral implications of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, emphasizing the need for humane conditions and adherence to the Geneva Convention. Some editorial writers argue that Canada should push for a tribunal to determine the prisoners' legal status, while others support the U.S. military's approach, fearing it might imperil American lives. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's abrupt departure from politics has drawn criticism, with pundits calling his actions a betrayal and ridiculing his claimed family reasons. John Manley, his replacement, is praised as competent and honest, emerging as a trusted leader in the Cabinet. The moral framing highlights the conflict between legal obligations and security concerns, as well as the betrayal and ridicule surrounding Tobin's exit. END OF SUMMARY.
