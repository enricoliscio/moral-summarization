Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They provided a detailed news article and want me to first identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of those morally framed words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of its content. It's about editorial reactions to two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley in Canada.

For STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that are morally framed. That means words that carry positive or negative connotations related to ethics or values. I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph.

In the first part, words like "plight," "weighing," "controversial," "more pressing," "thugs," "humane," "harsh," "inhumane," "assurances," "insist," "competent," "tribunal," "Geneva Convention," "laws," "behaving," "golden boy," "betrayal," "content," "pension," "sarcasm," "ridiculing," "mastered," "unstable," "rough sea," "flighty," "opportunistic," "lacking commitment," "sensible," "trust," "emerged," "crisis," "sensible," "serious," "voice," "competent," "scrupulously honest," "added clout," "bodes well."

Wait, I need to make sure each of these words is indeed morally framed. For example, "plight" shows concern, "controversial" indicates debate over right/wrong, "thugs" is derogatory, "humane" is positive, etc. I should list each one as a bullet point.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping the moral elements. The main points are the criticism of Tobin, support or concern over Guantanamo treatment, and praise for Manley. I should mention the differing opinions on the prisoners' treatment, the harsh criticism of Tobin, and the positive reception of Manley.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it too lengthy. I'll structure it by first addressing the al-Qaeda issue, then move to Tobin's departure and the criticism, and finally touch on Manley's positive reception.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200. I'll draft the summary, then count the words. If it's over, I'll trim unnecessary parts but keep the moral framing intact.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to list the morally framed words and then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the moral and political implications of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure from Canadian politics. Editorial writers debate whether the U.S. is treating the prisoners humanely, with some arguing for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention to determine their legal status, while others support the U.S. military's approach. Meanwhile, Tobin's abrupt exit is met with criticism, with pundits labeling him as unstable, flighty, and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley, his replacement, is praised as competent, scrupulously honest, and a sensible leader. The article highlights the moral dilemma of balancing national security with humanitarian laws and the political fallout from Tobin's tenure. END OF SUMMARY.
