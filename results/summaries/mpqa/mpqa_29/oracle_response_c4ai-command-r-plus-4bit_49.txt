SUMMARY: The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the departure of Brian Tobin from politics and the elevation of John Manley to Deputy Prime Minister. The plight of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has also been a topic of debate, with some arguing for more humane treatment and others supporting the U.S.'s tough stance. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star believe that a 'competent tribunal' should decide the legal status of the detainees, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, stating that the U.S. military's harsh treatment of prisoners is necessary to protect American lives. No one sheds tears for Mr. Tobin, who is criticized for his betrayal of voters and opportunistic antics. Columnists ridicule his assertion that he left politics for family reasons, portraying him as a flighty and unstable politician. In contrast, Mr. Manley receives high praise as a sensible, serious, and competent leader. His new role as Deputy Prime Minister is seen as a positive development for the country.
