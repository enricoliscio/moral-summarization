SUMMARY: The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian editorial writers and pundits, with some arguing for humane treatment and a competent tribunal to determine their legal status, while others believe that overreacting to the situation may imperil American lives. The departure of Brian Tobin from politics has also drawn criticism, with many seeing it as a betrayal of voters and a lack of commitment. The sarcasm and vitriol directed at Mr. Tobin stand in stark contrast to the praise heaped upon John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who is hailed as a sensible and honest voice in Cabinet. His elevation to the position of Deputy Prime Minister is seen as a positive development for the country. The moral framing of the article centers around concepts of humane treatment, trustworthiness, and commitment, with a critical eye towards betrayal and overreaction.
