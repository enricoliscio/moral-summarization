SUMMARY: While the plight of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits, the recent Cabinet shuffle and departure of Brian Tobin have also drawn criticism. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a 'competent tribunal' to decide the legal status of detainees, citing the Geneva Convention, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S.'s treatment of prisoners. As for Mr. Tobin, his sudden exit from politics is met with scorn, with critics citing his betrayal of voters and opportunistic nature. The vitriol is contrasted by praise for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who is hailed as a sensible and honest leader.
