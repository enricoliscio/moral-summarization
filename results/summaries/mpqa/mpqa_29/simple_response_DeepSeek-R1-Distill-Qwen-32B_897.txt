Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it first. The article talks about two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics.

Starting with the al-Qaeda prisoners, the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star are critical of the U.S. treatment, arguing for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. They believe in humane treatment and following laws. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S., saying any change might endanger lives and that critics are overreacting. This shows a moral debate between following international law and national security.

Moving on to Brian Tobin, the article mentions that he's not getting much sympathy. Columnists like Walter Robinson and Rosa Harris-Adler criticize him for betraying voters and being unstable. Meanwhile, John Manley is praised as competent and trustworthy. This reflects a moral judgment on Tobin's character and actions versus Manley's positive traits.

I need to make sure the summary captures both the moral arguments about the prisoners and the criticism of Tobin, while highlighting the contrast with Manley's positive reception. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and preserving the original moral framing is key.
