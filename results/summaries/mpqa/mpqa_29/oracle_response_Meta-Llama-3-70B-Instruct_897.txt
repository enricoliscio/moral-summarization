SUMMARY:

The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin. While Tobin's "antics" have been met with criticism, the plight of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked a heated debate. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide their legal status, as required by the Geneva Convention. However, The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, suggesting that treating the prisoners any differently could "imperil" American lives.

Meanwhile, Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with scorn, with many labeling it a "betrayal" of voters. Columnists have ridiculed his assertion that he left for family reasons, calling him "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking" in commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible" and "scrupulously honest" leader.
