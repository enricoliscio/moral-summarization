Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. The editorials from various newspapers present different moral perspectives on these issues.

First, I'll focus on the al-Qaeda prisoners. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that the prisoners should be treated humanely, emphasizing the need for a tribunal to determine their legal status. They use words like "plight," "harsh," "treatment," and "decide." The Daily Press, on the other hand, supports the U.S. actions, using terms like "imperil" and suggesting that critics are overreacting.

Next, regarding Brian Tobin, the article highlights the negative reactions. Words like "antics," "betrayal," "unstable," "vitriol," "flighty," and "opportunistic" are used to describe him. Columnists criticize his decision to leave, questioning his motives and effectiveness. In contrast, John Manley receives praise with terms like "sensible," "serious," and "competent."

I need to ensure the summary includes these moral terms without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure the summary by addressing both topics, highlighting the conflicting viewpoints on the prisoners and the mixed reception of Tobin versus the praise for Manley.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the key moral words and keep it concise. I'll start with the al-Qaeda issue, then move to Tobin's departure and the praise for Manley. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political implications of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. Editorials argue that while the prisoners' plight and harsh conditions are concerning, the U.S. claims of humane treatment are questionable. Some pundits advocate for a tribunal to decide their legal status, emphasizing the importance of adhering to laws and not behaving like terrorists. Others, however, support the U.S. military's actions, suggesting that any different treatment might imperil American lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's departure is met with criticism, with commentators labeling his actions as antics and betrayal, while also describing his career as unstable. His decision to leave is ridiculed, with accusations of being flighty, opportunistic, and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised as sensible, serious, and competent, with his role in national security seen as a positive development. END OF SUMMARY.
