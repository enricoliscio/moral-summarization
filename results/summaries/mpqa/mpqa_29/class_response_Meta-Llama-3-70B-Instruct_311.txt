SUMMARY:

The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa. The Ottawa Citizen argues that "even thugs deserve humane treatment" and that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. The Sudbury Star agrees, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, suggesting that treating the prisoners humanely might "imperil American lives". Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of "betrayal" and "opportunism". In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible manager" who is "competent and scrupulously honest". The moral tone of the article emphasizes the importance of humane treatment, even for those deemed "thugs", and criticizes those who prioritize political expediency over commitment to their job.
