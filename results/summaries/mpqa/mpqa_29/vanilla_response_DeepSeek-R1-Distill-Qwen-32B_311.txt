Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about two main topics: the situation of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. 

First, regarding the prisoners, some Canadian newspapers are criticizing the US treatment. They mention harsh conditions and argue that Canada should push for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. Others, like The Daily Press, support the US, saying treating prisoners differently could endanger lives.

Next, Brian Tobin's exit from politics has sparked criticism. Columnists are calling him unreliable and uncommitted, and they're not shedding tears for him. On the flip side, John Manley, his replacement, is being praised as competent and trustworthy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the differing opinions on the prisoners, the criticism of Tobin, and the praise for Manley. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
