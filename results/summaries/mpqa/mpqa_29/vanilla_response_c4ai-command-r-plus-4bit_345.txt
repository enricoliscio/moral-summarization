SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Canada reflect on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin, while also addressing the controversial issue of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a 'competent tribunal' to decide the legal status of detainees, citing the Geneva Convention, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S.'s handling of prisoners. As for Tobin's exit from politics, he receives criticism from various columnists who view his departure as a betrayal of voters and question his motives. Michel Vastel describes Tobin's career as a "rough sea," while Paul Schliesmann criticizes his opportunistic nature. On the other hand, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, receives praise for his sensible management and serious voice in Cabinet during the Sept. 11 crisis. The Citizen and Sun commend Manley's competence and honesty, with the Citizen noting that his added clout bodes well for Canada.
