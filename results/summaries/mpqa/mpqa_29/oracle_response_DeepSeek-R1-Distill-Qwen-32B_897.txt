Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics.

I notice that the author uses several morally charged words like "plight," "harsh," "betrayal," and "vitriol." My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the moral perspective.

Starting with the al-Qaeda prisoners, the article mentions the harsh conditions and the debate over their treatment. Some editors argue for humane treatment and a tribunal, while others support the U.S. actions. I'll make sure to include terms like "plight," "harsh," and "treatment."

Next, regarding Brian Tobin, the article is critical, using words like "betrayal," "unstable," and "vitriol." I'll summarize the negative reactions, highlighting his departure and the reasons given, like "family reasons" being mocked.

I also need to mention John Manley's positive reception, using words like "sensible" and "competent." 

I'll structure the summary to first address the al-Qaeda issue, then move on to Tobin's departure and the praise for Manley. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring the moral terms are preserved.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each moral word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral debate over the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, emphasizing their "plight" and the "harsh" conditions they face. Editors argue that while the U.S. claims humane treatment, a "competent tribunal" is needed to "decide" their legal status under the Geneva Convention. Some pundits, however, support the U.S. approach, fearing it might "imperil" American lives. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has sparked "vitriol," with critics calling his actions a "betrayal" and his career "unstable." Columnists mock his claim of leaving for "family reasons," while others describe him as "flighty" and "opportunistic." In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, receives praise for being "sensible" and "serious," with high hopes for his role in national security. END OF SUMMARY.
