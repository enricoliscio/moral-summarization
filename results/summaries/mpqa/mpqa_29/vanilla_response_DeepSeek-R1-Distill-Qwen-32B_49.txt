Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points. 

The article talks about two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. 

First, regarding the al-Qaeda prisoners, different newspapers have varying opinions. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star are critical of the U.S. treatment, arguing for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S., saying that changing treatment might endanger lives.

Next, the article discusses Brian Tobin's exit from politics. He's facing criticism for leaving, with pundits calling him unstable and lacking commitment. Meanwhile, John Manley, his replacement, is being praised as competent and trustworthy.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the key points from each section. I'll structure it by first addressing the al-Qaeda debate, then moving on to Tobin's criticism and Manley's praise.

Let me make sure to include the main arguments from each side on the Guantanamo issue. Then, I'll summarize the criticism Tobin received and the positive reception of Manley. 

I should avoid including too many details, just the essential information. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, ensuring it's under the word limit. 

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically from one point to the next, covering both the al-Qaeda debate and the political changes in Ottawa.
