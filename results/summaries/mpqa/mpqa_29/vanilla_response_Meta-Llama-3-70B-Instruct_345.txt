SUMMARY:

Editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics. Many argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and that Canada should insist on a "competent tribunal" to decide their legal status, as required by the Geneva Convention. However, some disagree, saying that treating the prisoners too leniently could put American lives at risk. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many calling him "flighty" and "opportunistic". In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible manager" who Canadians can trust.
