SUMMARY:
The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian pundits and editorial writers, with some arguing for humane treatment and a competent tribunal to determine their legal status, while others support the U.S.'s harsh approach, believing that showing compassion to the "thugs" could endanger American lives. The departure of Brian Tobin, a former MP, has also been heavily criticized, with writers calling him "flighty," "opportunistic," and a "betrayal of voters." Tobin's unstable political career and insincere justifications for leaving politics are mocked, with one columnist sarcastically imagining his ineptitude at home. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, receives praise for his sensible and serious management of the Sept. 11 crisis, and his scrupulously honest character. His elevation is seen as a positive step for Canada's national security. END OF SUMMARY.
