SUMMARY:

The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin. While Tobin's sudden exit has been met with criticism, the real concern lies with the treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that Canada should insist the US allow a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention, ensuring humane treatment. In contrast, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the US treatment of the prisoners, citing concerns for American lives. Meanwhile, the pundits have been scathing in their criticism of Tobin, accusing him of betraying voters and being opportunistic. In stark contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for his competence, honesty, and sensible management. The moral imperative is clear: even in the face of conflict, laws and humane treatment must prevail.
