SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Canada weighed in on the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics. While some argued for more humane treatment and a tribunal for the prisoners, others supported the U.S.'s tough stance. As for Mr. Tobin, the consensus was largely critical, with writers chastising his political opportunism and lack of commitment. The lone praise was reserved for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who was lauded for his competence and honesty.

The Ottawa Citizen editorial called for Canada to insist that the U.S. allow a 'competent tribunal' to determine the legal status of Guantanamo Bay detainees, citing the Geneva Convention. The Sudbury Star agreed, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagreed, arguing that treating prisoners differently could imperil American lives.

Writers criticized Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics, with Walter Robinson of The Ottawa Sun calling it his "third consecutive betrayal of voters." Columnists ridiculed his asserted family reasons, with one sarcastically imagining his ineptitude at diapering a baby. Michel Vastel wrote that Tobin made too many enemies in Ottawa, while Paul Schliesmann criticized his opportunism and lack of commitment.

John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, received praise for his role in the Sept. 11 crisis and his competence and honesty.
