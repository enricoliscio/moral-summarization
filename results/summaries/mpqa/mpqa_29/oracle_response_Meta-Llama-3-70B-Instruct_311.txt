SUMMARY:

The editorial writers in Ottawa have been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin. The general consensus is that Tobin's antics have earned him no sympathy, with many labeling his departure as a betrayal of voters. His treatment of the public has been deemed harsh, and his lack of commitment to his job as an MP has been criticized. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for his sensible and serious approach to governance.

Meanwhile, the plight of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that even thugs deserve humane treatment and that Canada should insist on a competent tribunal to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention. However, The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, stating that treating the prisoners any differently might imperil American lives.

The moral tone of the editorials is clear: Tobin's behavior is deemed unacceptable, while Manley's approach is seen as trustworthy and honest. The treatment of al-Qaeda fighters raises questions about humane treatment and the importance of upholding international law. END OF SUMMARY.
