SUMMARY: The plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian pundits and editorial writers, with some arguing for humane treatment and a UN tribunal, while others support the U.S.'s tough approach. The controversy surrounding Brian Tobin's abrupt departure from politics has elicited criticism and ridicule, with many questioning his motives and commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for his competence, honesty, and sensible management during the Sept. 11 crisis. Tobin's political career was marked by instability and opportunism, and his departure has been framed as a betrayal of voters. The print pundits' harsh judgments reflect a strong moral stance against disloyalty and irresponsibility in public office. They emphasize the importance of commitment, stability, and integrity in Canada's political leaders, values that Manley is believed to embody. The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners raises ethical questions about balancing security and civil rights, with some arguing for adherence to international laws and others prioritizing the safety of American lives. These contrasting perspectives highlight a complex moral landscape in the post-9/11 era. END OF SUMMARY.
