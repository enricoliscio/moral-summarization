Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley in Canada. 

First, regarding the prisoners, there's a debate among editorial writers. Some, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, argue that the prisoners should be treated humanely and that Canada should push for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. They emphasize that laws prevent us from behaving like the terrorists. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. treatment, suggesting that changing it could endanger American lives and that bin Laden might approve of the criticism.

Next, the article talks about Brian Tobin's departure from politics. He's criticized for betrayal and instability, with pundits being harsh. Meanwhile, John Manley is praised as competent and trustworthy, emerging as a leader after the September 11 crisis.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral perspectives intact. I'll structure it by first addressing the Guantanamo issue, highlighting the divide between those advocating for humane treatment and those supporting the U.S. actions. Then, I'll move on to the political aspect, contrasting Tobin's criticism with Manley's praise.

I should ensure that the moral arguments are clear: the debate over human rights versus security, and the evaluation of politicians' integrity and effectiveness. Keeping the summary concise but informative is key.

SUMMARY: The article highlights two key issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure. Editorial writers debate whether the U.S. is adhering to humane standards, with some advocating for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention to address the detainees' legal status. Others support the U.S. approach, arguing it protects American lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's exit from politics has drawn criticism for his perceived betrayals and instability, with pundits expressing relief at his departure. In contrast, John Manley, his replacement, is praised as competent and trustworthy, emerging as a strong leader post-September 11. The moral framing emphasizes the tension between human rights and security, as well as the importance of political integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
