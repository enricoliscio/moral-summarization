SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Canada have weighed in on the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the recent departure of politician Brian Tobin. While some, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a tribunal to determine their legal status, others, like The Daily Press, believe that the U.S. military's harsh treatment of the prisoners is justified in the name of national security. As for Mr. Tobin, the consensus among pundits is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing his opportunistic nature and lack of commitment. The exception to this is Michel Vastel, who writes a fond goodbye to his "favourite Newfie." Overall, the pundits save their praise for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, describing him as competent, honest, and a sensible manager.
