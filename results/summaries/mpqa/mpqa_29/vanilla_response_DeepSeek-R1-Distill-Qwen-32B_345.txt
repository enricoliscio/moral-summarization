Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. 

The article starts by talking about the reactions of editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa regarding two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley.

First, regarding the al-Qaeda prisoners, some editors like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star are critical of the U.S. treatment, arguing for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. Others, like The Daily Press in Timmins, support the U.S. approach, suggesting that critics might be overreacting.

Next, the article discusses Brian Tobin's departure from politics. There's a lot of criticism towards him, with pundits calling him unstable and uncommitted. Columnists like Walter Robinson and Rosa Harris-Adler are particularly harsh, mocking his reasons for leaving. On the other hand, John Manley is being praised as competent and trustworthy, emerging as a key figure post-September 11.

So, the summary needs to capture both the differing opinions on the Guantanamo issue and the contrasting receptions of Tobin and Manley. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all key points without getting too detailed.

I'll structure it by first addressing the Guantanamo debate, then move on to Tobin's criticism and Manley's praise. I'll make sure to mention the main arguments from each side and the pundits' reactions to the political changes.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well. I'll start with the Guantanamo issue, mention the support and criticism, then shift to Tobin's departure and the negative feedback, followed by Manley's positive reception. That should cover all the essential points succinctly.
