SUMMARY: The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among editorial writers and pundits in Canada, with some expressing concern over the harsh conditions and calling for a 'competent tribunal' to decide their legal status. While the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue for humane treatment and a UN-formed tribunal, The Daily Press counters that the U.S. military's approach is justified to protect American lives. Turning to domestic politics, the sudden departure of Brian Tobin has been met with criticism and ridicule. Pundits accuse him of betrayal and opportunism, with one columnist sarcastically addressing his claimed family reasons. Meanwhile, the elevation of John Manley to Deputy Prime Minister has been praised, with editorials highlighting his sensible and serious approach during the Sept. 11 crisis. Overall, the pundits' discourse in Ottawa reveals a focus on the plight of prisoners, the antics of politicians, and the praise for a steady hand in a time of crisis.
