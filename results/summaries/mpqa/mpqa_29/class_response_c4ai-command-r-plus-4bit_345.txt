SUMMARY: The treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian editorial writers and pundits, with some arguing for humane treatment and a 'competent tribunal' to determine their legal status, while others believe that overreacting to the issue could imperil American lives. Meanwhile, the recent cabinet shuffle and departure of Brian Tobin have elicited criticism and ridicule from pundits, who view his exit as a betrayal of voters and question his stated reasons for leaving. The elevation of John Manley to Deputy Prime Minister, however, has been praised, with editorials highlighting his competence, honesty, and sensible management during the Sept. 11 crisis. Tobin's career has been described as unstable and fraught with political opportunism, in stark contrast to the positive reception Manley has received.
