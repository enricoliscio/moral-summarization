Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about editorials and pundit opinions in Ottawa regarding two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley.

First, the article discusses the differing opinions on the Guantanamo Bay detainees. Some editors, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, argue that the prisoners should be treated humanely and suggest that Canada should push for a UN tribunal. They emphasize following the Geneva Convention to avoid behaving like the enemies. On the other hand, the Timmins Daily Press supports the U.S. approach, saying that changing how prisoners are treated could put American lives at risk.

Next, the article shifts to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. Editorials criticize him for betraying voters and being unstable, with sarcastic takes on his family reasons for leaving. His political career is described as inconsistent. In contrast, John Manley is praised as competent and trustworthy, emerging as a key figure post-9/11.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the editorials on Guantanamo, noting the support for humane treatment versus U.S. support. Then, I'll address the criticism of Tobin and the praise for Manley. I'll make sure to keep it concise, highlighting the key points without getting into too much detail.
