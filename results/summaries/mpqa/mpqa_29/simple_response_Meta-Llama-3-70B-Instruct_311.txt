SUMMARY:

The Canadian press has been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. While some, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a fair tribunal to determine their legal status, others, like the Daily Press in Timmins, believe the US is justified in its treatment of the prisoners. Meanwhile, former minister Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with widespread criticism, with many accusing him of being "flighty, opportunistic and lacking in commitment." In contrast, new Deputy Prime Minister John Manley has been praised for his competence and honesty. The moral framing of these issues is clear: the treatment of prisoners should be guided by the principles of humanity and fairness, and politicians should be held to high standards of integrity and commitment.
