Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article talks about two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the reactions to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. The author uses specific morally charged words like "humane," "betrayal," and "ridiculing." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll focus on the al-Qaeda prisoners. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star emphasize the need for humane treatment and a tribunal, which are important moral points. The Daily Press supports the U.S. approach, saying it's necessary to protect lives, which is another moral consideration.

Next, Brian Tobin's departure. The article mentions he's been criticized for betrayal and his credibility is mocked. The pundits are critical, using words like "ridiculing" and "betrayal." I should include that his actions are seen as inconsistent and lacking commitment.

Then, John Manley is praised as competent and honest, which are positive moral traits. I need to highlight the contrast between Tobin's criticism and Manley's approval.

I should structure the summary to cover both topics, ensuring each moral word is included. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. Let me draft it step by step, making sure not to miss any key moral points.

SUMMARY: The article discusses two moral issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the criticism of Brian Tobin's political departure. Editorial writers emphasize the need for "humane treatment" of detainees, arguing that while conditions are harsh, they may not be inhumane. Some, like the Ottawa Citizen, advocate for a "competent tribunal" under the Geneva Convention, while others, such as The Daily Press, argue that "overreacting" to the prisoners' treatment could "imperil American lives." Meanwhile, Tobin's departure is met with criticism for his "betrayal" of voters and "ridiculing" of his claims to leave for family reasons. Columnists describe his career as "unstable" and lacking commitment. In contrast, John Manley is praised as "competent" and "scrupulously honest," emerging as a trusted leader. The moral framing highlights the tension between upholding laws and protecting national security, as well as the accountability of politicians. END OF SUMMARY.
