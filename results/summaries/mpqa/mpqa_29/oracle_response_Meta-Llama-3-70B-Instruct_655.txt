SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been weighing in on the recent Cabinet shuffle and the departure of Brian Tobin. While Tobin's "antics" have been met with criticism, the "plight" of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate. The Ottawa Citizen argues that even "thugs" deserve "humane treatment" and that Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees. The Sudbury Star agrees, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, citing concerns that treating prisoners too well could "imperil" American lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's sudden departure has been met with scorn, with many calling him "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking" in commitment. In contrast, new Deputy Prime Minister John Manley has been praised as "sensible," "serious," and "scrupulously honest." END OF SUMMARY.
