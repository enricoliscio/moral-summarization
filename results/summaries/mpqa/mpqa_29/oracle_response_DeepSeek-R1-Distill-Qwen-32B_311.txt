Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout involving Brian Tobin and John Manley.

The author uses several morally charged words like "plight," "harsh," "treating," and "betrayal." I should make sure to include these in the summary to maintain the moral perspective. 

First, the article talks about the editorial opinions on the prisoners. Some argue for humane treatment and a tribunal, while others support the U.S. actions to protect lives. This shows a moral debate on justice versus security.

Next, Brian Tobin's departure is criticized harshly, using terms like "betrayal," "unstable," and "vitriol." The pundits are not holding back their criticism, highlighting his perceived failures and the negative impact on public trust.

On the other hand, John Manley is praised as "sensible" and "competent," which contrasts Tobin's downfall and shows a positive moral stance on leadership.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, ensuring I include the key moral terms and the contrasting viewpoints. I'll structure it by first addressing the Guantanamo issue, then Tobin's criticism, and finally Manley's praise. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the specified tokens.

Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's abrupt departure from politics has sparked criticism, with pundits labeling his actions as "antics" and "betrayal," while also describing his career as "unstable" and "flighty." In contrast, John Manley, his replacement, is praised as "sensible," "serious," and "competent," with the focus shifting to his role in national security. The moral framing highlights the tension between justice and security, as well as the critique of Tobin's leadership and the praise for Manley's steadiness. END OF SUMMARY.
