SUMMARY: As the plight of prisoners and politicians weighs on the minds of Canada's editorial writers and pundits, opinions diverge on the treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. While some argue for humane treatment and a competent tribunal to decide their legal status, others defend the U.S.'s harsh conditions and caution against endangering American lives. The sudden departure of Brian Tobin from politics elicits criticism and ridicule, with pundits highlighting his opportunistic nature and unstable career. In contrast, the elevation of John Manley to Deputy Prime Minister is met with praise, with editorials describing him as a sensible, honest, and competent leader. Overall, the print pundits' take on recent events in Canadian politics and the war on terror reveals a moral framework that values stability, commitment, and sensible management.
END OF SUMMARY.
