Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about editorials in Ottawa regarding two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle involving Brian Tobin and John Manley.

First, I'll identify the key points. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue for humane treatment and a tribunal, emphasizing the importance of following the law. On the other hand, The Daily Press supports the U.S. treatment, fearing it might help Osama bin Laden.

Next, regarding Brian Tobin, the editorials are critical. He's accused of betraying voters and being unstable. John Manley, however, is praised as competent and trustworthy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include both the moral arguments about the prisoners and the political critiques. I'll structure it by first addressing the Guantanamo issue, then the political shuffle, and finally the praise for Manley.

I should ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”some argue for humanitarian treatment, others prioritize security. For the political part, highlight Tobin's criticism and Manley's praise.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit. Make sure to include all main points without getting too detailed.
