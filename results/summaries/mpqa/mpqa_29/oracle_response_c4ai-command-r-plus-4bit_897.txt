SUMMARY: The treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay has sparked debate among Canadian editorial writers and pundits, with some expressing concern over the harsh conditions and calling for a competent tribunal to determine their legal status. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue for upholding the Geneva Convention, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. position, suggesting that treating the prisoners differently could imperil American lives. Meanwhile, the recent departure of Brian Tobin from politics has elicited criticism and ridicule from columnists, who characterize his actions as a betrayal of voters and question his asserted family reasons. Tobin is described as unstable and opportunistic, with his career likened to a rough sea. In contrast, the elevation of John Manley to Deputy Prime Minister has been met with praise, with pundits in Ottawa highlighting his competence, honesty, and sensible management during the Sept. 11 crisis.
