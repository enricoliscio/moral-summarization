SUMMARY:

The article discusses the opinions of editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa regarding the departure of Brian Tobin from politics and the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. While some, like the Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star, argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a competent tribunal to decide their legal status, others, like The Daily Press, support the US treatment of the prisoners. Meanwhile, Tobin's departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many calling him "flighty", "opportunistic", and "lacking in commitment". In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as a "sensible manager" and "competent and scrupulously honest". Overall, the article highlights the differing opinions on these two topics among editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa.
