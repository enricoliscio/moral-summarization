Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political shuffle in Canada involving Brian Tobin and John Manley. 

Starting with the al-Qaeda prisoners, there's a debate among editorial writers. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that the prisoners should be treated humanely and that Canada should push for a tribunal under the Geneva Convention. They believe this is important to maintain our moral standards and not behave like the terrorists. On the other hand, The Daily Press in Timmins supports the U.S. approach, saying that changing how prisoners are treated could put American lives at risk and that critics might be overreacting.

Then, the article shifts to Brian Tobin's departure from politics. He's being criticized for betraying voters and being unstable. Columnists are sarcastic about his family reasons for leaving, and some say he wasn't committed to his job. Meanwhile, John Manley is being praised as competent and trustworthy, emerging well from the September 11 crisis.

So, the moral framing here is about the treatment of prisoners and the integrity of politicians. The summary should highlight these two aspects, showing the debate on prisoner rights and the criticism of Tobin versus the praise for Manley.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures both the moral arguments about Guantanamo and the political criticism. I'll structure it by first addressing the al-Qaeda debate, then move to Tobin's criticism and Manley's praise, keeping each part brief but informative.

Let me check the word count as I go. I should avoid getting too detailed on each point, just the essentials. Make sure to include the differing opinions on the prisoners and the contrasting views on the politicians. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The news article highlights two key issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the political fallout from Brian Tobin's departure. Editorial writers debate the morality of U.S. detention practices, with some arguing for humane treatment and adherence to the Geneva Convention, while others defend the U.S. approach as necessary for security. Meanwhile, Tobin faces harsh criticism for his abrupt exit, accused of betraying voters and lacking commitment. Columnists mock his claims of leaving for family reasons, while praising John Manley as a competent and trustworthy leader. The moral framing emphasizes the importance of upholding legal and ethical standards even in times of conflict, contrasting Tobin's perceived failures with Manley's strengths. END OF SUMMARY.
