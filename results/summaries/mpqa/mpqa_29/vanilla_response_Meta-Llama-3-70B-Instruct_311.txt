SUMMARY:

The article discusses the reactions of editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa to the departure of Brian Tobin from politics and the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. While many are critical of Tobin's sudden departure, citing his lack of commitment and opportunistic nature, they are more sympathetic towards the plight of the al-Qaeda prisoners, arguing that they deserve humane treatment and a fair trial. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star advocate for a UN tribunal to determine the legal status of the detainees, while The Daily Press in Timmins supports the US treatment of the prisoners. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, is praised for his sensible management and honesty.
