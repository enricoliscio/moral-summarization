Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about editorial reactions to two main topics: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and Brian Tobin's departure from politics. 

For the al-Qaeda part, the editorials are divided. Some argue for humane treatment and a tribunal, while others support the U.S. military's approach. The morally framed words here include "plight," "treatment," "harsh," "decide," "address," "determine," and "imperil." I need to incorporate these.

Regarding Brian Tobin, the consensus is negative. Words like "antics," "betrayal," "unstable," "vitriol," "flighty," "opportunistic," "lacking," "sensible," and "serious" are used. The summary should reflect the criticism towards Tobin and the praise for John Manley.

I need to structure the summary to cover both topics, ensuring each gets a mention and the moral terms are included. I'll start with the al-Qaeda issue, then move to Tobin's departure and the reaction, and finally mention John Manley's positive reception.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll also use the specified tokens at the beginning and end. 

Let me draft this, making sure to include the key moral words and maintain the original framing. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral implications of the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the fallout from Brian Tobin's departure from politics. Editorial writers debate the "plight" of the detainees, arguing for humane "treatment" and the need for a tribunal to "decide" their legal status, while others fear this could "imperil" U.S. lives. Meanwhile, Tobin's "antics" and "betrayal" of voters have drawn sharp criticism, with pundits labeling him "unstable," "flighty," and "opportunistic." His departure has been met with "vitriol," while John Manley, his successor, is praised as "sensible" and "serious." END OF SUMMARY.
