SUMMARY: Editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa discuss the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners and the recent departure of Brian Tobin from politics. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star argue that Canada should ensure the prisoners' legal status is determined by a 'competent tribunal', as per the Geneva Convention. The Daily Press, however, supports the U.S.'s treatment of prisoners, suggesting that treating them differently could imperil American lives. As for Mr. Tobin, his departure is met with criticism and ridicule. Columnists highlight his betrayal of voters and opportunistic nature, with one sarcastically chronicling his imagined struggles with fatherhood. Michel Vastel, a columnist in Le Droit, bids farewell to his "favourite Newfie," noting Mr. Tobin's instability and the enemies he made in Ottawa. The only praise among the pundits is reserved for John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, who is described as a "sensible, serious voice in Cabinet" and a "competent and scrupulously honest" leader.
