SUMMARY:

The Canadian press has been weighing in on two pressing issues: the treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the departure of Brian Tobin from politics. While some editorial writers argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a fair tribunal to determine their legal status, others believe that the US military's harsh conditions are necessary to prevent further harm. Meanwhile, Tobin's sudden departure has been met with widespread criticism, with many pundits calling him "flighty," "opportunistic," and "lacking in commitment." In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for his competence and honesty. The moral framing of these issues is clear: treating prisoners humanely is a matter of upholding the law and distinguishing ourselves from terrorists, while politicians like Tobin who prioritize personal interests over public duty are unworthy of trust.
