SUMMARY:

The editorial writers and pundits in Ottawa have been discussing the plight of prisoners, particularly the al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, and the recent departure of Brian Tobin from politics. While some argue that the prisoners deserve humane treatment and a competent tribunal to decide their legal status, others believe that the US military's treatment of the prisoners is justified to prevent further harm to American lives. Meanwhile, Brian Tobin's sudden departure from politics has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of being "flighty, opportunistic, and lacking in commitment" to his job as an MP. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised for being a "sensible manager who Canadians can trust" and "competent and scrupulously honest". The moral framing of these discussions emphasizes the importance of upholding humane treatment and the rule of law, even in the face of conflict and security concerns.
