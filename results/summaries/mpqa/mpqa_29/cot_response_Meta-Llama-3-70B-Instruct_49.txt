SUMMARY:
The editorial writers in Ottawa have been weighing in on the treatment of al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, with many arguing that even "thugs" deserve "humane" treatment. The Ottawa Citizen and Sudbury Star believe Canada should insist the US allow a "competent tribunal" to decide the legal status of the detainees, as required by the Geneva Convention, while The Daily Press in Timmins disagrees, suggesting that treating the prisoners differently might "imperil" American lives. Meanwhile, former politician Brian Tobin has faced criticism for his sudden departure, with many calling him "flighty", "opportunistic", and "lacking" in commitment. In contrast, John Manley, the new Deputy Prime Minister, has been praised as "sensible", "serious", and "scrupulously honest". END OF SUMMARY.
