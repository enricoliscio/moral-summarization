SUMMARY:
China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence globally, demanding that the US stop its policy of dominating the world. The document highlights the US' "loathsome" and "horrifying" actions in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were bombed, and the global community's "shameful" silence in response. The US is accused of being the number one country in damaging solidarity and violating human rights. China's statement is a rare voice of dissent against the US' "dictatorial" move to target countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The document also exposes the US' "selfish" and "immoral" actions, including its disregard for human rights and its own constitution. Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and take a more cautious approach. END OF SUMMARY.
