SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and domination of the world. The US is accused of using the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to launch a war on terrorism, bombard Afghanistan, and label Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an "axis of evil". The document condemns the US for violating human rights, perpetuating oppression, and ignoring international conventions. The US is also accused of double standards, selfishness, and maintaining supremacy through aggression and terrorism.

The document highlights the US's history of subjugating regions, toppling governments, and installing rulers of its choice. It also criticizes the US for its racial prejudice, lack of protection for women's rights, and engulfment in violence and crime. Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and instead take careful steps to protect its own interests.

The document is a call to action, urging the US to stop its policy of domination and oppression, and for the international community to hold the US accountable for its actions. END OF SUMMARY.
