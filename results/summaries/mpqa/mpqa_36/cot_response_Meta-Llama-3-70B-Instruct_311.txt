SUMMARY:
China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of dominating the world.

The US has been accused of using blind force to oppress other countries, violating human rights, and promoting artificial slogans of democracy and human rights. China has demanded that the US stop its policy of oppression and supremacy, and instead respect the sovereignty of other nations. The document also exposes the US' double standards, selfishness, and violent nature. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US and take a more cautious approach in its dealings with the country.
