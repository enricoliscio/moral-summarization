SUMMARY: A recent document issued by China's State Council strongly criticizes the expanding military presence and hegemonic policies of the United States on the international stage. China accuses the US of violating human rights and damaging the solidarity of other nations, demanding an end to its oppressive and interfering actions. The article traces a history of US aggression and terrorism, citing Noam Chomsky's writings and historical events such as the post-World War II plans for economic subjugation and the CIA's involvement in toppling governments. The author argues that the US attack on Afghanistan, and its treatment of prisoners, are indicative of a long-standing psychology of maintaining supremacy. The article also mentions the double standards and selfishness of the US, highlighting the arrest and exile of Israeli spies, and the human rights violations within the US itself. Pakistan's blind support for the US post-9/11 is criticized, with a call for the country to re-evaluate its stance in light of China's report. The article concludes by urging Pakistan to carefully consider its alignment with the US and to recognize the negative consequences of its unconditional support.
END OF SUMMARY.
