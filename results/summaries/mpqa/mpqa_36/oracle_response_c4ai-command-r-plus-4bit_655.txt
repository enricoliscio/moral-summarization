SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing critique of the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of global dominance. China's statement comes in the wake of the US's "war on terrorism" following the 9/11 attacks, where Afghanistan was blamed without a proper investigation and subsequently bombarded. The US's actions in Afghanistan, where defenseless Muslims were blown up, are condemned as one of history's most dreadful events of oppression. The world's shameful silence has only encouraged the US to target other countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, with complete disregard for human rights and international conventions. Noam Chomsky's writings reveal that US aggression and terrorism are rooted in its historical psyche, dating back to the oppression of blacks in 1818. The US has toppled governments and installed rulers to maintain its supremacy, as evidenced by its National Security Council Memorandum. The US ignores its own human rights violations while criticizing others, and its actions post-9/11 have negated its own constitution. Pakistan, a staunch US supporter post-9/11, has only earned a bad name and increased internal and external problems. China demands that the US stop its policy of interference and oppression, and the world must view the US in its true light as a violent, crime-ridden country that disregards human rights.
