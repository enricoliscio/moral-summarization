SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world, demanding that it stops interfering in other countries' affairs. The document condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan for the 9/11 attacks without proof and waging a war that led to the bombing of defenseless Muslims. It also criticizes the US for targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." Noam Chomsky's writings are referenced to highlight the US's historical aggression and terrorism to maintain its supremacy. The article mentions the CIA's involvement in toppling foreign governments and the US's disregard for human rights, including the detention of Pakistanis and Taliban prisoners post-9/11. China calls out the US for its hypocrisy and selfishness, urging it to end its oppressive policies. The article concludes that Pakistan should rethink its unconditional support for the US and make decisions in its best interests.
