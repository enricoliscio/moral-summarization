SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance worldwide. The document condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan for terrorism after 9/11 and launching a war that has resulted in the deaths of innocent Muslims. The US has also announced plans to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, citing them as an "axis of evil". China argues that the US has become the number one country in damaging solidarity and violating human rights, and that its actions are driven by a desire to maintain its own interests and supremacy. The document also cites the US's history of aggression and terrorism, including its support for dictators and its own human rights violations. China is calling on the US to stop interfering in the affairs of other countries and to respect international law. The document serves as a wake-up call for the world, including Pakistan, which has blindly supported the US and suffered as a result.
