Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article starts by mentioning a document issued by China after a State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. The author talks about the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan without proper investigation, leading to the bombing campaign. They describe the bombing as a dreadful event, targeting innocent Muslims, and criticize the global silence, including the Muslim community, on this issue.

Then, the US moves to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of its "axis of evil." The article mentions that the US is accused of transferring nuclear tech to Islamic countries. It also notes that the US includes Russia and China in its list of threats. The author points out that this is the first time an important country like China has spoken out against the US since 9/11.

The document from China openly accuses the US of damaging international solidarity and violating human rights. Iranian President Khatami condemns Bush's "axis of evil" speech. The article then brings up Noam Chomsky's analysis, suggesting that the US has a history of aggression and terrorism, going back to the 19th century. It mentions how the US has overthrown governments in various countries and the NSS memorandum from 1950 that emphasizes maintaining US supremacy.

The article also discusses the US's hypocritical stance on human rights, citing examples like the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo and the arrest of Pakistanis after 9/11. It questions whether the US itself might have orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and accuses the US of double standards, especially regarding Jewish and Israeli involvement, which the media has reported on.

The conclusion is that China is justified in calling out the US for its imperialistic policies and human rights violations. The article warns Pakistan about blindly supporting the US, suggesting it's only benefiting the US and causing problems for Pakistan.

Now, to summarize this, I need to capture the key points: China's criticism of US military expansion, the context of 9/11 and the resulting wars, the moral critique of US actions, the historical analysis by Chomsky, the hypocrisy on human rights, and the advice to Pakistan. I must ensure the summary reflects the author's moral stance against US policies and their impact on international relations and human rights.

I should structure the summary to first mention the document and its criticism, then the context of 9/11 and US actions, followed by the moral critique, historical background, human rights hypocrisy, and the conclusion about Pakistan. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but include all these elements.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll also make sure to highlight the moral framing, such as the US's oppression, double standards, and the negative impact on countries like Pakistan.
