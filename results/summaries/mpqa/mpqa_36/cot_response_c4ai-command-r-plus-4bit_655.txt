SUMMARY:
China has recently released a document criticizing the expanding military presence and hegemonic policies of the United States on the international stage. The document condemns the US for its reaction to the 9/11 attacks, blaming Afghanistan and waging a war that resulted in the horrific oppression of innocent Muslims. The world's shameful silence encouraged the US to announce a second phase of its "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." China demands that the US stop interfering in other nations' affairs under the guise of human rights, accusing America of violating the rights of its own citizens and those abroad. China's report exposes American aggression, oppression, and hypocrisy, detailing how the US has toppled governments and imprisoned innocent people without trial. It highlights the US's impulsive and hegemonic actions, such as the attack on Afghanistan, and its interference in other countries' affairs. The report also critiques American society, citing violence, crime, racial prejudice, and the lack of protection for women's rights and sanctity. China calls on the world to view the US in its true light and for Pakistan to rethink its blind support for America, which has brought little benefit and increased internal and external problems. This report demands that the US be held accountable for its actions and respect the sovereignty of other nations.
