SUMMARY:

China has issued a scathing document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and dominance worldwide. The document condemns the US for its aggressive policies, including the invasion of Afghanistan and its plans to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. China accuses the US of violating human rights and damaging international solidarity. The document also cites American intellectual Noam Chomsky's writings, which expose the US's history of aggression and terrorism to achieve its goals. The US is accused of promoting democracy and human rights as a pretext to protect its own interests, while ignoring its own human rights violations. The document highlights the US's double standards, citing the detention of Pakistanis and Taliban prisoners without trial, and its own human rights abuses. China demands that the US stop interfering in other countries' affairs and respect international law. The report serves as a wake-up call for the world, including Pakistan, to reevaluate its blind support for the US and prioritize its own interests.
