SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing critique of the United States' expanding military presence and dominance on the world stage, demanding an end to its oppressive and interventionist policies. This comes in the wake of the US's post-9/11 "war on terror," which China views as a pretext for global domination and a violation of other nations' sovereignty and human rights. The US response to the 9/11 attacks, including the invasion of Afghanistan and the "shameful silence" that followed, is criticized as a horrific event in history, with innocent Muslims bearing the brunt of US aggression. The US's targeting of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil" and its designation of Russia and China as potential nuclear targets are cited as further evidence of American hegemony. Noam Chomsky's writings are invoked to highlight the long history of US aggression and imperialism, rooted in a disregard for moral values and the protection of self-interest. China's report also draws attention to the US's own human rights violations, both domestically and abroad, such as the treatment of Taliban prisoners and the incarceration of Muslims post-9/11. China calls on the US to cease its interference in other nations' affairs and for the world to view the US in its true light. Pakistan, a close US ally, is urged to reconsider its unconditional support for the US and to prioritize its own interests and circumstances.
