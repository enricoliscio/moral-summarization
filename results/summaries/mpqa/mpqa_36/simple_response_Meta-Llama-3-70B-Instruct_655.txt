SUMMARY:

China's State Council has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and domination of the world. The document highlights the US's aggressive behavior, including its attacks on Afghanistan and its labeling of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an "axis of evil". The US's actions are seen as a violation of human rights and an attempt to maintain its supremacy. The document also points out the US's double standards, citing its own human rights violations, including the detention of prisoners without trial and the mistreatment of Taliban prisoners. The report also notes the US's history of aggression, dating back to the 19th century, and its disregard for international conventions and its own constitution. China's statement is seen as a wake-up call for the world, and Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and take a more independent stance.
