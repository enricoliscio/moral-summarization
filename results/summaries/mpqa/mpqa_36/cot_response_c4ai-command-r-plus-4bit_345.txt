SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the United States for its expanding military presence and demanding an end to its oppressive and hegemonic policies. The document accuses the US of violating human rights and international conventions, with specific reference to the war on Afghanistan and the treatment of Taliban prisoners. China's statement is a response to the US declaration of a "war on terrorism" and its targeting of countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." The US is also criticized for its hypocrisy and double standards, particularly regarding its treatment of Muslims post-9/11. Noam Chomsky's analysis of US foreign policy is referenced, highlighting American aggression and the prioritization of self-interest over moral values. The article also mentions the US State Department's human rights assessments of other countries while ignoring its own violations. Pakistan's support for the US post-9/11 is questioned, given the negative consequences it has faced. The article concludes with a call for Pakistan to reevaluate its relationship with the US and to carefully consider its demands and requests. China's stance highlights the US's negative reputation and encourages a reevaluation of its global actions and interference in other countries' affairs.
