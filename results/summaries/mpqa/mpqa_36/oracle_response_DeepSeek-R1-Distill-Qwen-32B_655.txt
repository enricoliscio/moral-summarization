Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about a Chinese document criticizing the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. It mentions the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan without proper investigation, leading to a coalition and ongoing bombardment. The author uses strong moral terms like "attacks," "terrorism," "oppression," and "dictatorial." 

I should note the key points: China's criticism of US military actions, the impact on Afghanistan and innocent Muslims, the US's move to target other countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and the mention of Noam Chomsky's analysis. Also, the article discusses US human rights violations, such as detaining Pakistanis and keeping prisoners in inhuman conditions. It ends by advising Pakistan to rethink its support for the US.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping as many of the morally charged words as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the criticism, the consequences of US actions, and the call for a rethink. I'll make sure to include terms like "attacks," "terrorism," "oppression," "dictatorial," "violations," and "double standards." I should also mention the impact on Pakistan. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure each sentence conveys a main point without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and dominating global policy. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. blamed Afghanistan without proper investigation, leading to a coalition's bombardment and innocent casualties. Encouraged by global silence, the U.S. declared a broader "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." China condemns the U.S. for damaging international solidarity, violating human rights, and using dictatorial tactics. The document highlights U.S. aggression, including inhumane treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, and accuses the U.S. of double standards and selfishness. China calls for the U.S. to stop its policy of oppression and supremacy, urging other nations, including Pakistan, to rethink their support for American actions. The U.S. is accused of ignoring its own human rights obligations and exploiting terrorism to justify global dominance. END OF SUMMARY.
