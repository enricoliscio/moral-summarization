SUMMARY: A recent document issued by China's State Council session has strongly criticized the expanding military presence and dominance of the United States on the international stage. The document demands that the US stop its policy of global domination, particularly in Afghanistan, where bombardment and the oppression of innocent Muslims have been deemed one of the most dreadful events in history. The US has also been accused of dictatorial actions and violating human rights, with specific mention of the imprisonment of Taliban prisoners in inhumane conditions. China's report highlights the hypocrisy and selfishness of the US, exposing its true agenda of maintaining hegemony and interfering in other countries' affairs under the guise of human rights. The report also criticizes the United States for its violent and crime-ridden society, lack of protection for women's rights, and racial prejudice. Pakistan, a strong supporter of the US after the 2001 attacks, is urged to rethink its stance and carefully consider its own interests in light of China's revelations. The summary of this article underscores the moral implications of US actions and their impact on global stability and human rights.
