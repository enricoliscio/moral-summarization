SUMMARY: In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States has pursued a policy of global domination and military expansionism, according to a recent statement by China's State Council. The US has been criticized for unjustly blaming Afghanistan for the attacks and waging a war that has caused immense suffering among innocent Muslims. The international community's silence in the face of US aggression has only emboldened the superpower to expand its "war on terror," with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea now labeled as an "axis of evil." The US has also threatened the use of nuclear weapons against countries like Russia and China, which it deems a threat to its security.

China's statement exposes the hypocrisy of the US in claiming to uphold democracy and human rights while violating these very principles both domestically and abroad. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has argued that US aggression is rooted in its historical pursuit of economic and geopolitical interests, often at the expense of moral values and the rights of other nations. The US has a long history of toppling governments and installing puppet rulers to serve its own agenda.

Furthermore, the US has shown a blatant disregard for human rights, both internationally and within its own borders. While it criticizes other countries for human rights violations, it fails to acknowledge its own shortcomings, such as the inhumane treatment of Taliban prisoners and the targeting of Muslims in the aftermath of 9/11. China's report should serve as a wake-up call for the international community to recognize the true nature of US policies and their detrimental effects on global peace and stability. Pakistan, in particular, should reconsider its unconditional support for the US and instead, carefully evaluate its actions in light of its own national interests.
