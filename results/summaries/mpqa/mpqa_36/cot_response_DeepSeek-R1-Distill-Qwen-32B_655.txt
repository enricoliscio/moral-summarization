Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this user's query. They provided a detailed news article and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also asked for two steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed words" mean. These are words that carry a strong moral judgment or evaluation, like "criticism," "oppression," or "terrorism." I should go through the article and pick out each word that has such a connotation.

Looking at the article, it's critical of the US's actions post-9/11, accusing them of dominating the world, terrorism, and human rights violations. Words like "criticism," "dominating," "terrorism," "oppression," "injustice," etc., stand out as morally charged.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping those moral terms. The summary should highlight China's criticism of the US, the specifics of their accusations like targeting Afghanistan and other countries, the human rights violations, and the implications for Pakistan. I should also mention the historical context provided by Noam Chomsky and the hypocrisy of the US's human rights assessments.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with China's stance, moving through the US's actions and their moral implications, and ending with the advice to Pakistan. I should avoid any technical jargon and keep it clear and concise.

Let me start by listing the morally framed words. I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph, noting each word that carries a moral judgment. Then, I'll structure the summary to include these words while encapsulating the main points without exceeding the word limit.

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't lose the critical tone towards the US, as that's central to the article's moral framing. Including terms like "dictatorial," "oppression," "injustice," and "hypocrisy" will help maintain that tone.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within 200 words and that all key points are covered: China's criticism, US policies, human rights issues, historical context, and advice to Pakistan. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.
