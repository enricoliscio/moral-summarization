SUMMARY:
China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of dominating the world. The document condemns the US for its "loathsome" and "horrifying" actions in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were brutally killed. The US has also been accused of having a "dictatorial" approach, labeling countries as "axis of evil" and threatening to use nuclear weapons. The document highlights the US' "shameful" disregard for human rights and its "selfish" pursuit of its own interests. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has also exposed the US' "immoral" psyche, which has been evident since 1818. The report is a wake-up call for the world, and Pakistan, in particular, needs to rethink its blind support for the US. END OF SUMMARY.
