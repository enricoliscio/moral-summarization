Alright, I need to summarize this article about China's criticism of the US after the September 11 attacks. The article is pretty detailed, so I should break it down.

First, the article mentions a document from China's State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. After 9/11, the US blamed Afghanistan and started a war, leading to innocent deaths. China is upset about this and the US targeting other countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of their "axis of evil."

The article also talks about historical US actions, like toppling governments in the past, and how the US ignores human rights, even within its own system. It mentions Guantanamo Bay and the unfair treatment of prisoners. China is calling out the US for hypocrisy and urging them to stop interfering in other countries' affairs.

Additionally, the article suggests that Pakistan might have made a mistake by supporting the US too much without benefit. It ends by advising Pakistan to think independently instead of following the US blindly.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: China's criticism, the US actions post-9/11, targeting other countries, human rights issues, and the advice to Pakistan. Make sure it's concise and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.
