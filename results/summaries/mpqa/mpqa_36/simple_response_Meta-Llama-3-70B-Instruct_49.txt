SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance over the world. The document condemns the US for its aggression and violation of human rights, particularly in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were killed in the name of fighting terrorism. The US is accused of using the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to launch a war on terrorism, targeting countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. China argues that the US is driven by a desire to maintain its supremacy and protect its interests, rather than promoting democracy and human rights. The document also highlights the US's double standards, citing its own human rights violations, racial prejudice, and lack of protection for women's rights. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US and take a more independent stance. The document serves as a wake-up call for the world to see the US in its true perspective.
