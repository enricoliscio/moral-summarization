SUMMARY: China has issued a scathing critique of the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of dominating the world, demanding an end to its oppressive and interventionist actions. The document condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan for the 9/11 attacks without proper investigation and forming a coalition that resulted in the ongoing bombardment and suffering of innocent Muslims. It criticizes the US for announcing a second phase of its "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and for its hypocrisy in assessing human rights violations in other countries while ignoring its own. The US is accused of prioritizing its own interests over moral values and protecting them at the cost of global solidarity and human rights. American intellectual Noam Chomsky's writings are cited to support the argument that US aggression and terrorism are rooted in its historical pursuit of power and dominance. China's stance is justified in light of the US's disregard for international human rights conventions, its own constitution, and the suffering caused by its actions globally. Pakistan, a strong US supporter post-9/11, is urged to rethink its stance and act in its own best interests rather than blindly following US demands. This report should serve as a wake-up call for the world to see the true nature of US actions and their detrimental effects.
