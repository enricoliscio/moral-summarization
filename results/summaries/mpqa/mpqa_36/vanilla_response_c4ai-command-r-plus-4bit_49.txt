SUMMARY: China has released a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of dominating the world. The document condemns the US for its actions in Afghanistan and its plans to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. It also mentions the US's history of aggression and terrorism to maintain its supremacy and protect its interests worldwide. Noam Chomsky's writings are referenced to support this claim. The article also mentions the human rights violations committed by the US, including the detention of Pakistanis and Taliban prisoners in inhumane conditions. The involvement of Jews in the September 11 attacks and the arrest of Israeli spies in the US are mentioned as examples of the US's double standards. China demands that the US stop interfering in other countries' affairs and that the world should view the US in its true perspective. Pakistan is encouraged to rethink its unconditional support for the US and to carefully consider its actions in light of China's report. 

END OF SUMMARY.
