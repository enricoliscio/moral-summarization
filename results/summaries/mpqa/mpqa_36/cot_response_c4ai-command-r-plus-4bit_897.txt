SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the expanding military presence and dominance of the United States on the international stage, accusing the country of violating human rights and damaging the solidarity of other nations. The document specifically mentions the war on terrorism and the invasion of Afghanistan as examples of US aggression and dictatorship. It also condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan without proper investigation and for the inhumane treatment of Taliban prisoners. The Iranian President Khatami has also protested against the US's dictatorial attitude and its labeling of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an 'axis of evil'. Noam Chomsky's writings are referenced to highlight the historical context of American aggression and the prioritization of its own interests over moral values. The article also mentions the double standards and selfishness of the US, exemplified by its expulsion of Israeli spies while maintaining a military presence worldwide. China demands that the US stops interfering in other countries' affairs under the guise of human rights and points out the violence, crime, and racial prejudice prevalent in American society. It urges the world to view the US in its true light and for Pakistan to rethink its blind support for the country post-9/11, as it has only brought problems and a bad name for Pakistan. China's report should serve as a wake-up call for a reassessment of relations with the US, urging caution and careful consideration of US demands.
