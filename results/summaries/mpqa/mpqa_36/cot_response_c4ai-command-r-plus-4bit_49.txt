SUMMARY:
The recent document issued by China after its State Council session strongly condemns the expanding military presence and hegemonic policies of the United States on the international stage. China accuses the US of violating human rights and damaging the solidarity of other nations, specifically criticizing the US invasion of Afghanistan post-9/11 and its "war on terrorism." The article also mentions Noam Chomsky's writings, which reveal a long history of American aggression and terrorism to maintain its global supremacy. The US has toppled governments and installed rulers to serve its economic interests, with a particular focus on the Middle East and the Third World. China demands that the US stops its oppressive policies and interfering in other nations' affairs in the name of human rights, citing the violent and crime-ridden state of American society, the lack of protection for women's rights, and the racial prejudice prevalent in the country. China's report serves as a wake-up call for the world to see the true nature of the US and its selfish, oppressive actions. Pakistan, which has been a strong supporter of the US post-9/11, is urged to rethink its position and draw its own conclusions from China's report, carefully considering its actions rather than blindly accepting US demands. China's statement is a bold challenge to US hegemony and a call for a more just and respectful global order.
