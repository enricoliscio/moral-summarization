SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance worldwide. The document accuses the US of violating human rights and international law, citing the examples of Afghanistan, Iraq, and North Korea. It also mentions the US's double standards, racial prejudice, and lack of protection for women's rights. The document is seen as a bold move by China, which has traditionally been cautious in its criticism of the US. The Iranian President has also condemned the US's "axis of evil‚Äù statement. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has written about the US's history of aggression and terrorism to achieve its goals. The document serves as a wake-up call for the world and Pakistan, which has been blindly supporting the US, to rethink its stance and prioritize its own interests.
