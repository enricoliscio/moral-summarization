Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a summary of a news article. The article is pretty detailed and seems to be a critique of US foreign policy, particularly after 9/11. They mentioned that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It also needs to be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about a document from China's State Council that criticizes the US for its expanding military presence and its policy of world domination. It mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan post-9/11, the targeting of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of the 'axis of evil,' and the use of nuclear weapons against these countries. There's also criticism of the US's human rights record, including how prisoners are treated, and the mention of Noam Chomsky's analysis of US foreign policy.

I should identify the key elements: the source (China's document), the criticism of US actions, the specific countries targeted, the historical context provided by Chomsky, the human rights violations, and the implications for Pakistan. I need to condense this into a concise summary without missing any critical points.

I also need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: China's criticism, US military expansion, targeting of certain countries, historical context, human rights issues, and the advice to Pakistan. Then, I'll craft each sentence to cover these points succinctly.

I should avoid including too much detail about each event, just the essentials. For example, instead of listing all the countries where the US overthrew governments, I can mention it in a general sense. Also, I'll make sure to highlight the main arguments without getting bogged down in specifics.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the document's issuance, moving through the criticisms, historical context, human rights issues, and ending with the implications for Pakistan. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and adjust as necessary.

SUMMARY:  
A recent Chinese document issued after the State Council session criticized the United States for its expanding military presence and policy of global domination. It condemned the U.S. for its actions post-9/11, including the bombing of Afghanistan and targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of its "axis of evil." The document accused the U.S. of violating human rights and using nuclear threats against these nations, including China and Russia. China also highlighted the U.S.'s history of aggression, citing examples like the overthrow of foreign governments and its disregard for international conventions. The document criticized the U.S. for its inhumane treatment of prisoners, such as those held in Guantanamo Bay, and its double standards on human rights. It called for the U.S. to cease its hegemonic policies and stop interfering in other countries' affairs. The report also urged Pakistan to rethink its alliance with the U.S., suggesting it has not benefited from its support and has instead faced increased internal and external problems. END OF SUMMARY.
