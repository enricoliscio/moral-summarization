SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US's expanding military presence and demanding that it stop its policy of dominating the world. The document highlights the US's aggression and oppression, particularly in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were "blown up" by ammunition. The US's "dictatorial move" has been met with shameful silence from the global community, emboldening it to announce the second phase of its war against terrorism. The document condemns the US's "damaging" of solidarity and "violating" of human rights, and its "double standards" and "selfishness" in its treatment of prisoners. China's statement is a moral imperative, urging the US to stop "interfering" in the affairs of other countries under the guise of human rights. The document exposes the US's true nature, revealing a society "engulfed by violence and crime" with "no protection of women's rights." Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support of the US and take a more cautious approach. The report serves as an "eye opener" for the world, demanding that the US be viewed in its true perspective.
