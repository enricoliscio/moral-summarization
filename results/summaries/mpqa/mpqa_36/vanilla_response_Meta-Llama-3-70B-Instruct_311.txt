SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance globally. The document accuses the US of blaming Afghanistan for terrorism without proof and launching a war that has resulted in the killing of innocent Muslims. China also condemned the US for declaring Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil" and threatening to use nuclear weapons against them. The document states that the US has become the number one violator of human rights and solidarity among nations. China's statement is the first by an important country after the 9/11 attacks. The document also cites American intellectual Noam Chomsky's writings, which suggest that the US has a history of aggression and terrorism to achieve its goals. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US and take a more independent stance.
