SUMMARY:
China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and demanding that it stop its policy of dominating the world. The document highlights the US' "loathsome" actions in Afghanistan, where "defenseless, innocent, and poor Muslims" were killed, and its "dictatorial" move to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The US has been accused of violating human rights and damaging solidarity among countries. China's statement is the first by an important country since the 9/11 attacks, and it has been encouraged by the global community's "shameful" silence. The document also mentions the US' history of aggression and terrorism, citing examples such as its treatment of blacks in 1818 and its toppling of governments in Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Brazil, and Chile. The report is an "eye opener" for the world, and Pakistan should rethink its blind support for the US. END OF SUMMARY.
