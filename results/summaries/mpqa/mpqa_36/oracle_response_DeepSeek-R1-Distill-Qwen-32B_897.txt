Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective. The article is critical of the United States' foreign policy, especially after 9/11, and highlights China's recent criticism. 

I notice that the author uses a lot of morally charged words like "attacks," "terrorism," "oppression," and "dictatorial." My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and should capture the essence of the article's moral arguments.

The article talks about the U.S. expanding its military presence, the bombing of Afghanistan, and the subsequent targeting of other countries like Iraq and North Korea. It also mentions human rights violations, the treatment of prisoners, and the critique of U.S. policies by China and Iran. The author accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its own human rights record.

I should structure the summary to first mention China's criticism, then outline the U.S. actions post-9/11, including the wars and human rights issues. I'll need to include the moral terms like "terrorism," "oppression," "dictatorial," and "violence." Also, highlighting the points about double standards and the impact on Pakistan is important.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with China's stance, moving through the U.S. actions, and concluding with the implications for countries like Pakistan. I'll make sure to keep the language clear and concise, using the morally framed words where appropriate.

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each sentence covers a key point without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words. Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's moral framing and includes as many of the specified terms as possible.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and demands an end to its policy of global domination. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. blamed Afghanistan for terrorism, leading to a coalition war that caused indiscriminate bombings and innocent casualties. The global community's silence emboldened the U.S. to declare a second phase of its "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." The document highlights the U.S.'s hypocrisy, as it violates human rights while assessing others. The U.S. has detained prisoners in inhuman conditions, ignored international human rights conventions, and maintained a policy of supremacy through aggression and double standards. China condemns the U.S. for its dictatorial approach, urging it to stop interfering in other countries' affairs. The article also critiques Pakistan for blindly supporting the U.S., which has worsened its internal and external problems. The U.S.'s actions, including its history of subjugation and toppling governments, reveal a long-standing policy of maintaining global hegemony. END OF SUMMARY.
