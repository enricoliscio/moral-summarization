SUMMARY: In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States embarked on a campaign of military aggression and domination, unjustly blaming Afghanistan for terrorism and initiating a bombardment that wreaked havoc on innocent Muslims. The international community's silence emboldened the US to expand its "war on terror," with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea labeled as an "axis of evil." China, in a significant statement, condemned US hypocrisy in violating human rights and destabilizing other nations. Noam Chomsky's writings reveal a long history of American aggression and exploitation, dating back to the oppression of blacks in 1818. Post-WWII US policy aimed to subjugate regions for economic gain, toppling governments and installing rulers to serve its interests. The US attack on Afghanistan exemplifies its hegemonic mindset, ignoring human rights and international conventions. Pakistan, a staunch US supporter post-9/11, has suffered consequences, earning a bad reputation and facing increased internal and external problems. China's report should serve as a wake-up call, urging Pakistan to reevaluate its unconditional support for the US and instead, prioritize its own interests and moral obligations. Pakistan must carefully reconsider its alignment with the US and its actions that undermine its own values and well-being.
