SUMMARY: China has released a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and its policy of dominating the world. The document condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan for the 9/11 attacks without proper investigation and forming a coalition to bring an end to terrorism and the Taliban. It also criticizes the US for its plan to target Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and for its assessment of human rights violations in other countries while ignoring its own. The Iranian President, Mohammed Khatami, has also protested against the US's dictatorial move. American intellectual Noam Chomsky's writings reveal that aggression and terrorism are part of the American psyche, dating back to the oppression of blacks in 1818. The US has a history of toppling governments and installing rulers of its choice to maintain its supremacy. Chomsky's analysis suggests that the US attack on Afghanistan was not impulsive but driven by the psychology of maintaining US supremacy. China demands that the US stops interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights and creating conflicts. The report also highlights the issues of violence, crime, and racial prejudice in the US and the lack of protection for women's rights. Pakistan is encouraged to rethink its blind support for the US and draw its conclusions in light of its circumstances.
