Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should use as many as possible. The article talks about China criticizing the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. It mentions the September 11 attacks, the US blaming Afghanistan, the bombing, and innocent people being killed. There's also criticism of the US's "axis of evil" and its policies in other countries, including Pakistan's support leading to problems. I need to make sure the summary includes words like attacks, terrorism, bombardment, oppression, etc. Keep it under 200 words and start with SUMMARY: and end with END OF SUMMARY.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and policy of global domination, particularly after the September 11 attacks. The US, without proper investigation, blamed Afghanistan for terrorism and launched a coalition to combat the Taliban, leading to ongoing bombardment and the killing of innocent Muslims. The world's silence encouraged the US to announce a second phase of its "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil." China condemns the US for damaging international solidarity and violating human rights, highlighting its aggressive actions, including the illegal detention of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. The document accuses the US of hypocrisy, as it ignores its own human rights violations while criticizing others. China also criticizes the US for its history of subjugation, including toppling governments in the Third World. The article warns Pakistan against blindly supporting the US, suggesting it has gained little benefit and faces increased problems. China urges the US to stop its oppressive policies and interference in other countries' affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
