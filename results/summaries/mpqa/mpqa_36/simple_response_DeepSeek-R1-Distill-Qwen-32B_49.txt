Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a document issued by China after their State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. They mention the US's response to 9/11, blaming Afghanistan without proof, leading to the bombing campaign. The author describes this as a dreadful event, with innocent Muslims killed. The world's silence on this is shameful, and the US is now targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of their 'axis of evil'. 

China's document is the first major criticism post-9/11, accusing the US of damaging global solidarity and violating human rights. Iran's president also condemns the US. The article references Noam Chomsky, suggesting the US has a history of aggression and using terrorism for its interests. It goes back to US policies since the 19th century, like oppressing blacks, and how the US uses slogans of democracy while pursuing its interests. 

The US is accused of planning the 9/11 attack for hegemony, and their human rights assessments are seen as hypocritical. They mention the treatment of prisoners in Cuba and the involvement of Jews and Israeli spies, pointing out US double standards. The conclusion is that China is justified in calling out the US, and Pakistan should rethink its support for the US, which hasn't benefited them much.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral tone. The summary should highlight China's criticism, the US's actions post-9/11, the moral implications, and the call for Pakistan to reconsider its stance. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures the essence without losing the moral framing.

I should structure it by introducing China's criticism, the US's aggressive actions, the historical context, the hypocrisy in human rights, and the call to action for Pakistan. I need to ensure each point is briefly covered but clearly conveys the moral judgment against the US.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each sentence flows logically and maintains the critical tone towards the US's policies and actions.
