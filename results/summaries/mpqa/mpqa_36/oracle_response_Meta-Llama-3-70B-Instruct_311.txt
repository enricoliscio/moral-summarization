SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and demanding an end to its policy of global domination. The document condemns the US for its "dreadful" and "loathsome" actions in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were "blown up" by ammunition. The US is accused of "oppression" and "violating human rights" in its war on terrorism, which is seen as a pretext for maintaining its "supremacy" over other countries.

The document also criticizes the US for its "dictatorial" move in declaring Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil" and its plans to target these countries. China's statement is seen as a bold move, as it is the first time a major country has spoken out against the US' actions since the 9/11 attacks.

The article also quotes Noam Chomsky, who argues that the US has a history of using "aggression and terrorism" to achieve its goals, and that its actions are driven by a desire to maintain its own interests, rather than promoting democracy and human rights.

China's document serves as a wake-up call for the world, and Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and its own role in the global arena.
