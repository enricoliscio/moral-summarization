SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and demanding that it stop its policy of dominating the world. The document highlights the US' aggression and oppression in Afghanistan, where innocent Muslims were blown up by ammunition, and its subsequent declaration of war against terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The US has been accused of violating human rights and damaging solidarity among nations, with its own interests taking precedence over moral values. The document also points out the US' history of subjugating regions and installing rulers of its choice, as well as its disregard for international conventions and its own constitution. Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and take careful steps in its dealings with the country. The report serves as an eye-opener, exposing the US' true nature of violence, crime, and racial prejudice, and its lack of protection for women's rights and respect.
