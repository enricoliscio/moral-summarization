Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral perspective.

The article starts by talking about a document issued by China after their State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. It mentions the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan, leading to a coalition and ongoing bombardment. The author is upset about innocent Muslims being killed and the world's silence on this.

Then it talks about the US declaring a second phase of the war on terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as the "axis of evil." North Korea is accused of transferring nuclear tech to Islamic countries. The US also includes Russia and China in its list of threats, which is a strong statement.

China's document is significant because it's the first major country to openly criticize the US after 9/11. It accuses the US of damaging international unity and violating human rights. The Iranian President also condemns Bush's statements.

The article goes into historical context with Noam Chomsky's analysis, suggesting that the US has a history of aggressive actions, like in the 19th century and during the Cold War. It mentions specific instances where the US overthrew governments in Latin America and the Middle East. There's a reference to a 1950 memo about maintaining US supremacy at any cost, implying the Afghanistan attack wasn't just a reaction but part of a larger strategy.

It also discusses the US ignoring human rights after 9/11, detaining Pakistanis without trials, and the Guantanamo Bay prison conditions. The article questions if Jews were involved in 9/11 and mentions Israeli spies being deported, highlighting US double standards.

Finally, the article suggests that China is justified in calling out the US for its oppressive policies and human rights violations. It advises Pakistan to rethink its support for the US, as it hasn't benefited much and has faced more problems.

So, the moral framing here is critical of the US for hypocrisy, aggression, and human rights violations. It's highlighting the US's double standards, historical aggression, and the negative impact on countries like Pakistan. The summary needs to capture this critique and the call for accountability.

I should structure the summary to include China's criticism, the context of 9/11 and US actions, historical US behavior, human rights issues, and the advice to Pakistan. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral perspective is clear.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and policy of global domination, particularly following the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. targeted Afghanistan, leading to widespread civilian casualties, and has since declared Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil," with plans to extend its war on terrorism. China condemns the U.S. for violating human rights and undermining international unity, highlighting its history of aggression, including covert operations to overthrow governments in Latin America and the Middle East. The U.S. has also detained individuals without trials and subjected prisoners to inhumane conditions, as seen in Guantanamo Bay. The document accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy, prioritizing its interests over moral values, and urges countries like Pakistan to rethink their support for U.S. policies. China's critique underscores the need for accountability and a reevaluation of the U.S.'s role in global affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
