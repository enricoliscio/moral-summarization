SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominating world policies post-9/11. The document condemns the US for blaming Afghanistan without evidence and forming a coalition that resulted in the ongoing bombardment in Afghanistan. It also criticizes the global community's silence and the US's announcement of targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as the "axis of evil." China demands that the US stop interfering in other countries' affairs and creating conflicts in the name of human rights. The document highlights the US's hypocrisy in assessing human rights violations in other countries while ignoring its own. It mentions the imprisonment of Pakistanis and Taliban prisoners in inhumane conditions, as well as the possible involvement of Jews in the 9/11 events. The report concludes that the US's actions are driven by selfishness and hegemony. Noam Chomsky's writings are referenced to support the argument that US aggression and terrorism are rooted in its historical psyche. Pakistan's support for the US post-9/11 is also discussed, highlighting the increased internal and external problems it has faced as a result. Pakistan is encouraged to rethink its unconditional support for the US and act in its own best interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
