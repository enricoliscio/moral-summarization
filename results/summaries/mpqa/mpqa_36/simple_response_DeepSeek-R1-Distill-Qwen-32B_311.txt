Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user has given specific instructions: the summary should preserve the moral framing the author gave. They want it after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about a Chinese document criticizing US military expansion and its policies post-9/11. It mentions the US's actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, calling them part of a strategy to dominate the world. The author is critical of the US's approach, pointing out human rights violations and the hypocrisy in the US's stance on human rights. They also mention Noam Chomsky's analysis of US policies and the impact on countries like Pakistan.

I need to capture the moral critique here. The author is highlighting the US's aggressive foreign policy, its double standards, and the negative impact on other countries. The summary should reflect that the US is seen as a hegemon disregarding international law and human rights.

I'll start by mentioning the Chinese document's criticism of US military expansion and its post-9/11 actions. Then, I'll note the specific criticisms like the bombing of Afghanistan, targeting of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, and the US's hypocrisy in human rights. I'll include the mention of Noam Chomsky's historical context to show it's part of a long-standing policy. Finally, I'll touch on the impact on Pakistan and the call for a rethink.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clearâ€”emphasizing the US's aggressive, self-serving actions and the need for accountability.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and policy of global domination, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. The US's bombing of Afghanistan, targeting defenseless civilians, is condemned as a horrifying act of oppression. The document highlights the US's hypocrisy, as it criticizes human rights violations in other countries while ignoring its own, such as the inhumane treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. The US's declaration of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an "axis of evil" is seen as part of a broader strategy to maintain global supremacy, with roots tracing back to historical US aggression. China calls for the US to stop interfering in other countries' affairs under the guise of human rights. The article also criticizes Pakistan for blindly supporting the US, which has worsened its internal and external problems. The piece underscores the US's double standards, violence, and disregard for international law, urging a reevaluation of its true nature. END OF SUMMARY.
