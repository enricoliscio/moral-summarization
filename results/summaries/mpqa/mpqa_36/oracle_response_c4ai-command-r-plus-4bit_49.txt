SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the expanding military presence and dictatorial policies of the United States on the international level. The document demands that the US stop its policy of world domination and interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights. The criticism comes in the wake of the US's response to the September 11 attacks, where it blamed Afghanistan for terrorism without proper investigation and formed a coalition to bring an end to the Taliban regime. This led to the ongoing bombardment in Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of innocent and defenseless Muslims. The US has also announced a second phase of its war on terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." American intellectual Noam Chomsky has highlighted the aggressive and selfish nature of US policies, rooted in its history of oppressing minorities and maintaining global hegemony. China's report exposes the US's hypocrisy in assessing human rights violations in other countries while ignoring its own, and its disregard for international human rights conventions and its own constitution. It also highlights the violent and crime-ridden nature of American society and the lack of protection for women's rights. Pakistan, which has been a strong supporter of the US after September 11, 2001, should reconsider its stance in light of China's report and act in its own best interests rather than blindly accepting US demands. END OF SUMMARY.
