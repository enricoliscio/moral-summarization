Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about a document issued by China after their State Council session. It's criticizing the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. They mention the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan, leading to the war there. The article describes the bombing as a dreadful event, especially targeting innocent Muslims. It also points out the US's silence from the global community, including Muslims, which emboldened the US to declare a second phase against terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. 

China is calling out the US for damaging international solidarity and violating human rights. The Iranian President Khatami protests against the US's 'axis of evil' statement. The article references Noam Chomsky's analysis, suggesting the US's aggressive foreign policy is rooted in maintaining supremacy, going back to historical examples. It also mentions the US's hypocrisy in human rights, like detaining Pakistanis and holding prisoners in Guantanamo Bay without legal rights. 

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the main points: China's criticism of US military expansion, the context of 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan, the targeting of other countries, the human rights violations, and the call for the US to stop its oppressive policies. Also, mention Pakistan's situation and the implications of blindly supporting the US.

I should structure it to first state China's criticism, then the historical context, the US's actions post-9/11, the human rights issues, and the conclusion about the US's policies. Make sure it's clear and flows well without being too detailed.
