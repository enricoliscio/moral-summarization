Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about China criticizing the US for its military expansion and actions post-9/11. They mention the US's bombing of Afghanistan, the treatment of prisoners, and the broader implications of US foreign policy.

I should highlight the key moral issues: the US's aggressive actions, the bombing of defenseless people, the silence from the global community, the targeting of other countries, human rights violations, and the double standards of the US. Also, China's stance against US hegemony and the impact on countries like Pakistan.

I'll structure the summary to include the main events and the moral critique. I need to use the provided words like "attacks," "bombardment," "oppression," "violating," "double standards," etc.

I'll start by mentioning China's criticism of the US's military presence and the 9/11 attacks. Then, talk about the bombing in Afghanistan and the innocent casualties. Highlight the global silence and the US's expansion to other countries. Include the human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of prisoners. Mention the double standards and the impact on Pakistan.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. Make sure the summary starts and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: China has issued a critical document addressing the United States' expanding military presence and its post-9/11 actions, accusing it of dominating the world and violating human rights. The US's bombing of Afghanistan, targeting defenseless Muslims, and the global community's silence are condemned as acts of oppression. The US has declared a war on terrorism, labeling Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as the "axis of evil," and has used nuclear threats against these and other nations, including Russia and China. China highlights the US's hypocrisy, noting its failure to self-assess while criticizing others. The US's treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, shown as inhuman, and its double standards in handling terrorism are criticized. China argues that the US's actions, including its aggressive foreign policy and disregard for international law, reflect a desire for global supremacy. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US, which has worsened its internal and external problems. The document calls for the US to stop its oppressive policies and interference in other countries' affairs. END OF SUMMARY.
