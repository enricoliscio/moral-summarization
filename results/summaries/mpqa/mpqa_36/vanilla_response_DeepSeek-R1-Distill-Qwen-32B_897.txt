Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a document issued by China after their State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. They mention the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan, leading to the war there. The article is critical of the US actions, including the treatment of prisoners and the targeting of other countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. It also brings up historical US policies and the role of thinkers like Noam Chomsky. There's a mention of Pakistan's support for the US and the negative consequences they've faced. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points: China's criticism, US military actions post-9/11, targeting of certain countries, human rights issues, and the impact on Pakistan. I should structure it to cover these aspects clearly and succinctly.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese government document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and dominance on the global stage. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. blamed Afghanistan and launched a war, leading to indiscriminate bombing and civilian casualties. The document condemns U.S. actions, including the targeting of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of its "axis of evil," and accuses the U.S. of violating human rights and undermining international solidarity. It highlights the inhumane treatment of prisoners, such as those held at Guantanamo Bay, and questions the U.S. approach to terrorism and human rights. The document also criticizes U.S. policies, including historical interventions and the promotion of double standards. China calls for the U.S. to cease its hegemonic policies and interference in other countries' affairs. The article warns Pakistan against blindly supporting U.S. policies, suggesting it has caused more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
