SUMMARY:
China has issued a document criticizing the United States' expanding military presence and dominance worldwide. The document condemns the US' "loathsome" and "horrifying" actions in Afghanistan, where "defenseless, innocent, and poor Muslims" were brutally attacked. The US is accused of violating human rights and ignoring international conventions. China demands that the US stop its "dictatorial" and "oppressive" policies, which are driven by a desire for supremacy rather than a genuine concern for human rights. The document also exposes the US' "double standards" and "selfishness" in its treatment of prisoners and its own human rights record. Pakistan is urged to rethink its blind support for the US and consider the consequences of its actions. The report is a wake-up call for the world to see the US in its "true perspective".
