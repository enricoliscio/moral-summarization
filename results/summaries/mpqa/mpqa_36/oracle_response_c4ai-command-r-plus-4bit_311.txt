SUMMARY: China has issued a document criticizing the expanding military presence and dictatorial move of the United States on the international level. The document demands that the US stop its policy of dominating the world and its aggression towards other countries. The US has been accused of blaming Afghanistan for the 9/11 attacks without proper investigating and proof, leading to the ongoing bombardment and oppression in Afghanistan. The world witnessed the US's inhuman action, but no one raised a voice against it. The US has announced a second phase of its war on terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and continues to violate human rights and ignore international conventions. Pakistan, which has been supporting the US after 9/11, should rethink its position in light of China's report and draw its own conclusions. The US has a history of subjugating and toppling governments to maintain its supremacy, as pointed out by Noam Chomsky. China is justified in its criticism, and the US should be held accountable for its actions and interference in other countries' affairs. The US media has reported the possible involvement of Jews in the 9/11 attacks and the arrest of Israeli spies, exposing the selfishness and double standards of the US. The report should be an eye-opener for the world to see the true perspective of the United States.
