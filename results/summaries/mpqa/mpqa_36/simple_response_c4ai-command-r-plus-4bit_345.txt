SUMMARY: A recent document issued by China's State Council session strongly criticizes the expanding military presence and dominance of the United States on the international stage. The document calls out the United States for its aggressive policies and demands that it stops interfering in the affairs of other countries under the guise of human rights. The criticism comes in the wake of the United States' response to the September 11 attacks, where it blamed Afghanistan and formed a coalition to combat terrorism and the Taliban, resulting in ongoing bombardment in Afghanistan and the loss of innocent Muslim lives. The United States has also announced a second phase of its war on terrorism, targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." China's statement is significant as it is the first by an important country after the September 11 events. The document accuses the United States of damaging the solidarity of other nations and violating human rights, with American intellectual Noam Chomsky supporting this view by highlighting the historical context of American aggression and terrorism to maintain its global dominance. Pakistan, a strong supporter of the United States post-9/11, is also urged to reconsider its stance and draw its conclusions from China's report, carefully assessing the demands and actions of the United States. China's stance is a justified and moral response to the United States' oppressive and hegemonic policies, and it calls for a reevaluation of the superpower's true intentions and actions on the world stage.

END OF SUMMARY.
