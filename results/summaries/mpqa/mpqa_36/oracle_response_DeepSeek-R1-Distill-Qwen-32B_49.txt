Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about a document from China criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dictatorial actions. It mentions the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan without proper investigation, leading to bombardment and innocent casualties. The author uses strong moral terms like "terrorism," "oppression," and "violations."

I should focus on the key moral issues: US military expansion, lack of investigation post-9/11, innocent casualties, the "axis of evil" label, and human rights violations. Also, the article mentions China's criticism and Pakistan's support for the US, which hasn't benefited them.

I need to include as many of the specified moral words as possible. I'll structure the summary to highlight China's stance, the US actions, and the consequences. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me outline the main points: China's criticism, US military actions post-9/11, innocent casualties, targeting of Iran, Iraq, North Korea, human rights issues, and Pakistan's situation. I'll ensure each point uses the appropriate moral terms.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include words like "attacks," "terrorism," "bombardment," "innocent," "oppression," "violations," "dictatorial," "supremacy," and "interfering." I'll also mention the human rights abuses in Guantanamo and the double standards.

Finally, I'll conclude by emphasizing the need for countries like Pakistan to rethink their support for the US. I'll keep the language strong and moral, as per the original article.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and dictatorial policies, urging it to stop its oppressive global dominance. Following the 9/11 attacks, the US blamed Afghanistan without proper investigation, leading to indiscriminate bombardment and the killing of innocent Muslims. Encouraged by global silence, the US launched a second phase of its "war on terrorism," targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of its "axis of evil." The document condemns the US for violating human rights, including the inhuman treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, and highlights its double standards in assessing human rights violations elsewhere while ignoring its own. China emphasizes that the US's actions reflect a history of aggression, oppression, and the subjugation of other nations for its economic interests. The article also critiques Pakistan for blindly supporting the US, which has worsened its internal and external problems. The author urges the world, particularly Pakistan, to rethink its stance and hold the US accountable for its violations of moral and human rights principles. END OF SUMMARY.
