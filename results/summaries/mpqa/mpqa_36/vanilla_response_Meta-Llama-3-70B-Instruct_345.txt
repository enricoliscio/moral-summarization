SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance over the world. The document demands that the US stop its policy of dominating the world and respect the sovereignty of other countries. The US is accused of using the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to launch a war on terrorism, which has resulted in the bombardment of Afghanistan and the labeling of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as "axis of evil‚Äù. China's statement is the first by a major country since the 9/11 attacks, and it accuses the US of violating human rights and damaging international solidarity. The document also references American intellectual Noam Chomsky's writings, which suggest that the US has a history of using aggression and terrorism to achieve its goals. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US and to take a more independent stance in the light of China's report.
