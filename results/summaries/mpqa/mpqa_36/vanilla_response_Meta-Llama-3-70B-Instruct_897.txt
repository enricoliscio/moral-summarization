SUMMARY:

China has issued a document criticizing the US for its expanding military presence and dominance worldwide. The document accuses the US of blaming Afghanistan for terrorism without investigation and using the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to launch a war on terrorism. China also condemned the US for labeling Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an "axis of evil" and threatening to use nuclear weapons against them. The document highlights the US's history of aggression and human rights violations, citing examples such as the toppling of governments in Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Brazil, and Chile. China demands that the US stop interfering in the affairs of other countries under the pretext of human rights and democracy. The document also criticizes the US's treatment of prisoners, including those from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and its double standards on issues like racial prejudice and women's rights. Pakistan is urged to rethink its support for the US and take a more independent stance.
