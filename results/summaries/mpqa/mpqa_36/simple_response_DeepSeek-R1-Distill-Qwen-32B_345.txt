Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a document issued by China after their State Council session. It criticizes the US for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. The author mentions the 9/11 attacks and how the US blamed Afghanistan, leading to a coalition and ongoing bombardment. They describe the bombing as a dreadful event, especially targeting defenseless Muslims, and note the world's silence on this. The US then declared a second phase against Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as the 'axis of evil,' and China is the first to openly criticize this.

The article also brings up Noam Chomsky's analysis, tracing US aggressive policies back to the 19th century, using examples like the CIA overthrowing governments in the 20th century. It mentions US policies like the National Security Council memorandum from 1950, which aimed to maintain US supremacy. The author suggests the US might have planned the 9/11 attacks themselves for hegemony.

Additionally, the article discusses US human rights violations post-9/11, such as detaining Pakistanis without trials and inhumane treatment of prisoners in Cuba. It also points out the US media's role in showing these conditions, highlighting double standards and selfishness. The author criticizes the US for hypocrisy in human rights, especially with their military bases worldwide.

The conclusion is that China is justified in calling out the US's oppressive policies and that Pakistan should reconsider its support for the US, as it hasn't benefited much and has faced problems instead.

Now, to summarize this, I need to capture the main criticisms: US military expansion, 9/11 response, targeting of Muslim countries, historical US aggression, human rights violations, and the impact on Pakistan. I should present these points concisely, keeping the moral tone intact, which emphasizes the US's oppressive and hypocritical actions.

I'll start by mentioning China's criticism of the US's military expansion and dominance. Then, I'll touch on the 9/11 response leading to Afghanistan and the targeting of other countries. I'll include the historical context from Chomsky, the human rights issues post-9/11, and the impact on Pakistan. Finally, I'll conclude with China's stance and the call for rethinking alliances.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows logically. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A recent Chinese document criticizes the United States for its expanding military presence and policy of global dominance. Following the 9/11 attacks, the US targeted Afghanistan, leading to widespread civilian casualties, with the world's silence emboldening further actions against Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The document highlights historical US aggression, including CIA-led regime changes and a policy of maintaining supremacy, as outlined in the 1950 National Security Council memorandum. It also points to US human rights violations post-9/11, such as detaining Pakistanis without trials and inhumane treatment of prisoners in Cuba. The author suggests the US may have orchestrated 9/11 for hegemony and criticizes its hypocrisy in promoting human rights while violating them. China calls for the US to cease oppressive policies, and Pakistan is urged to reassess its support for the US, which has not yielded benefits but increased problems. END OF SUMMARY.
