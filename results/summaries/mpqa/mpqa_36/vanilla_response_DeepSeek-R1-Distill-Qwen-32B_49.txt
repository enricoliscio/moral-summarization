Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a document released by China after their State Council session. They criticized the U.S. for expanding its military presence and dominating the world. They mentioned the U.S. actions after 9/11, like bombing Afghanistan and targeting Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as part of their "axis of evil." The article also discusses historical U.S. actions, like toppling governments in the past, and criticizes the U.S. for ignoring human rights and using double standards. It mentions how the U.S. is holding prisoners in inhumane conditions and not following their own laws. The article suggests that China is calling for the U.S. to stop interfering in other countries' affairs. It also advises Pakistan to rethink its support for the U.S., as it hasn't benefited much. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: China's criticism of U.S. military expansion, their actions post-9/11, the targeting of certain countries, historical context of U.S. interventions, human rights issues, and the advice to Pakistan. I should make sure to include that the U.S. is accused of ignoring international conventions and using double standards. Also, highlight that China is urging the U.S. to stop its oppressive policies and that Pakistan should reconsider its alliance.

Let me structure this: Start with China's document and its criticism of the U.S. Then mention the U.S. actions after 9/11, the targeting of specific countries, historical context of U.S. interventions. Then discuss human rights issues and the U.S. ignoring its own laws. Finally, conclude with China's call for the U.S. to stop its policies and the advice to Pakistan.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make sure each sentence covers a key point without going into too much detail. Also, I should use clear and straightforward language to ensure the summary is easy to understand.
