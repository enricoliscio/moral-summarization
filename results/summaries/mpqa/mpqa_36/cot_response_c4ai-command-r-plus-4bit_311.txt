SUMMARY:
The article presents a critical perspective on the foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States post-9/11, with a specific focus on its military interventions in Afghanistan and its "war on terrorism." It accuses the US of unjustly blaming Afghanistan for the terrorist attacks and forming a coalition to initiate military operations that resulted in the tragic loss of innocent Muslim lives. The article highlights the silence of the global community, including the Muslim world, in the face of this oppression. It also criticizes the US for its dictatorial attitude, labeling of certain countries as an "axis of evil," and its hypocrisy in targeting countries for alleged weapons of mass destruction while ignoring its own human rights violations. Noam Chomsky's analysis of US aggression and terrorism is referenced, shedding light on America's historical pursuit of world domination under the guise of democracy and human rights. The article concludes with China's condemnation of US interference in other nations' affairs and its demand for an end to American policies of oppression and supremacy. It calls for Pakistan to reconsider its blind support for the US, highlighting the internal and external problems this support has caused. The article urges Pakistan to carefully assess its alignment with the US in light of China's revealing report.
