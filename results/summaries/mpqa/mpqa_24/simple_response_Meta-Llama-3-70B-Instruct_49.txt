SUMMARY:

NASA is at a crossroads as it bids farewell to Administrator Daniel Goldin and welcomes Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to steer the agency back on track. Goldin's 10-year tenure was marked by achievements in unmanned space exploration, but also by soaring costs and a loss of credibility in manned spaceflight, particularly with the International Space Station. The project's costs have ballooned from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, prompting the Bush administration to consider scaling back US involvement. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message: NASA must clean up its act before pursuing new initiatives. His task will require not only financial savvy but also diplomatic finesse to navigate international agreements and partnerships. While some see O'Keefe's appointment as a chance for NASA to regain its footing, others lament the agency's shifting focus from visionary goals to budget-cutting measures.

END OF SUMMARY.
