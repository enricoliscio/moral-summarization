SUMMARY:

NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, brings a background in finance and budget management to the agency, a stark contrast to his predecessor Daniel Goldin's space industry roots. This shift in focus is seen as a necessary correction to NASA's "dysfunctional" space program, plagued by soaring costs and credibility issues. The International Space Station, in particular, has seen its costs balloon from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, prompting the Bush administration to consider scaling back US involvement. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration to get NASA's fiscal house in order before pursuing more ambitious projects. While some analysts worry that NASA's objectives have become less visionary over time, others believe O'Keefe's financial acumen can help restore credibility to the agency. As one expert notes, "NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do."

END OF SUMMARY.
