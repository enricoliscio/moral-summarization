SUMMARY:

NASA's new mission is to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. After 10 years, administrator Daniel Goldin resigned, and President Bush nominated Sean O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, to replace him. Under Goldin, the agency implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach, but the International Space Station's costs ballooned far beyond original estimates, damaging the agency's credibility. The Bush administration planned to scale back US involvement, and a task force concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the station was not credible. O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before pursuing new ventures. His mandate is to fix the space station, which may require deft diplomacy to avoid violating international agreements. With O'Keefe at the helm, NASA may finally address its fiscal morass and restore its reputation.

END OF SUMMARY.
