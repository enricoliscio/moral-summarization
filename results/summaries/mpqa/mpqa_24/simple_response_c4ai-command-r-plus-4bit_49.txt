SUMMARY: As NASA bids farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, the agency faces significant challenges, including soaring space-station costs and a damaged reputation. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take on the role of administrator. O'Keefe's appointment signals a shift in focus for NASA, prioritizing fiscal responsibility and accountability over exploration and innovation. While Goldin implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach that increased the number of spacecraft and missions, the costs of the International Space Station have spiraled out of control. O'Keefe's mandate is to address these financial issues and restore trust in the agency. Analysts suggest that O'Keefe's expertise may be what NASA needs to get its house in order, but they also acknowledge that the agency's objectives have become less ambitious over time. The appointment is seen as a call to action for NASA to demonstrate responsible stewardship of taxpayer funds before embarking on new ventures.
