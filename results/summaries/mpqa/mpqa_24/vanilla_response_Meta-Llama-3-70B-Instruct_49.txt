SUMMARY:

NASA is undergoing a change in leadership as Daniel Goldin steps down after 10 years as administrator, and President Bush nominates Sean O'Keefe to replace him. O'Keefe, a financial expert with no background in space exploration, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency and cutting costs. Under Goldin, NASA made progress in unmanned spaceflight, but faced criticism for its manned spaceflight program, particularly the International Space Station, which has seen costs balloon from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration to "clean up its act" before pursuing new initiatives. Analysts believe O'Keefe's financial expertise may be what NASA needs to get back on track, but it will require diplomacy to navigate international agreements and partnerships.

END OF SUMMARY.
