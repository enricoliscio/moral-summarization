SUMMARY:

NASA is shifting gears with a new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin after 10 years. O'Keefe, a financial expert, is tasked with reining in the agency's soaring space-station costs and restoring credibility to the dysfunctional space program. Under Goldin, the agency's costs "ballooned" far beyond original estimates, particularly with the International Space Station, now projected to cost over $30 billion. The project's budget has been deemed "not credible" by a task force, and O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a call to "clean up" NASA's act. The agency's objectives have become less visionary, with a focus on cutting costs rather than pushing boundaries. O'Keefe's challenge is to fix the fiscal morass without violating international agreements, requiring deft diplomacy. If successful, NASA may "blossom" under his leadership, but for now, the focus is on fixing the "disaster" of the space station's budget.

END OF SUMMARY.
