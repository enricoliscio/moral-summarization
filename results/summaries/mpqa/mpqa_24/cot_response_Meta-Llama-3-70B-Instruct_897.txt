SUMMARY:
NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency's "dysfunctional" space program. With a background in finance, O'Keefe is expected to bring a "consummate" approach to cutting costs, a departure from his predecessor Daniel Goldin's "faster, better, cheaper" approach. While Goldin's tenure saw significant progress in unmanned spaceflight, the agency's credibility has been marred by cost overruns in manned spaceflight, particularly with the International Space Station. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a "mandate" to fix the station's fiscal problems, which may require "neat" diplomacy to navigate international agreements. Analysts hope that under O'Keefe, NASA can "clean up its act" and regain its former "visionary" status. END OF SUMMARY.
