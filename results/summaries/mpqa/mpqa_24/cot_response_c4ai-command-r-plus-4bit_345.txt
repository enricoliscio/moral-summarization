SUMMARY: As NASA bids farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after a decade-long tenure, the agency faces significant challenges. The soaring costs of the International Space Station, currently exceeding $30 billion, have raised questions about the credibility and functionality of NASA's manned spaceflight programs. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take on the role of administrator. O'Keefe's mandate is to address the fiscal morass surrounding the space station project, which has been criticized by international partners for violating agreements and facing cost-cutting measures. Under Goldin, NASA achieved notable unmanned craft successes but struggled with cost overruns and credibility issues in manned spaceflight. Analysts suggest that O'Keefe's appointment signals the administration's focus on fixing NASA's financial issues before pursuing more visionary objectives. O'Keefe's expertise may be crucial in deftly navigating the diplomatic and budgetary challenges ahead. END OF SUMMARY.
