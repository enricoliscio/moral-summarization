SUMMARY: In a bid to steer soaring space-station costs and restore credibility to what has been called a dysfunctional space program, NASA bids farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who held the office for a record 10 years. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a bean counter and not a space enthusiast, to replace him. Under Goldin, NASA achieved notable unmanned craft successes, but the agency's credibility has been questioned due to ballooning costs for manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station. O'Keefe, with a mandate to cut costs and fix the fiscal mess, may need both accounting savvy and diplomacy to navigate international agreements and partnerships. Analysts are hopeful that NASA will blossom under O'Keefe's leadership, but they also acknowledge the shift from visionary exploration to fiscal prudence in the agency's objectives. The appointment sends a clear message that NASA must fix its budgetary issues before embarking on ambitious missions. END OF SUMMARY.
