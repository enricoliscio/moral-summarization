SUMMARY: After 10 years, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin resigned, leaving behind a controversial legacy. During his tenure, NASA achieved notable successes in unmanned space exploration but faced significant challenges and criticism for the soaring costs of manned spaceflight projects, particularly the International Space Station. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take over as the new administrator. O'Keefe's appointment signals the administration's priority to address NASA's fiscal issues and restore credibility to the space program. While some analysts believe O'Keefe's financial expertise may be what NASA needs, others argue that the agency's focus on budget constraints could limit its visionary objectives. The task at hand for O'Keefe is daunting, requiring both accounting skills and diplomatic tact to navigate international partnerships and agreements. Only time will tell if he can successfully steer NASA out of its current moral and fiscal crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
