Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin. It mentions that O'Keefe is more of a financial manager than a space enthusiast, which is a shift from Goldin's background in aerospace.

I should highlight the issues NASA is facing, like the soaring costs of the International Space Station and the need for cost-cutting. Goldin's "faster, better, cheaper" approach led to some successes but also credibility issues, especially with manned missions.

The moral framing here is about the shift from exploration to fiscal responsibility. O'Keefe's appointment signals that NASA needs to fix its financial mess before it can focus on ambitious projects. I should mention the criticism from international partners about scaling back the station and the comparison to past administrators like James Webb.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective on the necessity of financial management over exploration at this time.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as it bids farewell to Administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after a decade marked by the "faster, better, cheaper" approach, which expanded unmanned missions but strained credibility in manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS, now over budget and facing criticism, has seen costs rise from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, sparking concerns about feasibility and international agreements. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a fiscal expert with no space background, to lead NASA, signaling a shift from exploration to financial accountability. While some see potential for revitalization, others argue that O'Keefe's focus on budget-cutting may overshadow NASA's visionary goals, leaving the agency to "clean up its act" before pursuing ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
