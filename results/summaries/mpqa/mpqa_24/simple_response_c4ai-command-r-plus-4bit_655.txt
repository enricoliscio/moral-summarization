SUMMARY: The resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin and the nomination of Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, signals a shift in priorities for the agency. Goldin, a product of the US aerospace industry, implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach that resulted in significant unmanned craft achievements but also in soaring costs for manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter with a mandate to cut costs and restore credibility to NASA, may be what the agency needs. However, fixing the fiscal morass of the space station program will require not just accounting savvy but also deft diplomacy, as scaling back the station's scope could violate international agreements and upset partner nations. Analysts are divided on the agency's future under O'Keefe, with some predicting a return to the visionary days of the Apollo program under another numbers guy, James Webb, while others argue that NASA's objectives have been growing less ambitious. The administration's message is clear: NASA must get its house in order before it can embark on new, exciting missions. END OF SUMMARY.
