SUMMARY:

NASA is set to undergo a significant change in leadership with the nomination of Sean O'Keefe as the new administrator, replacing Daniel Goldin who resigned after 10 years in office. O'Keefe, a former chief financial officer for the Pentagon and Navy secretary, is seen as a "bean counter" who can help steer the agency's soaring space-station costs back towards earth and restore credibility to the program. Under Goldin, NASA achieved several milestones, including finding evidence of water on the moon and inaugurating a long-term program to explore Mars. However, the agency's credibility has been questioned due to cost overruns, particularly with the International Space Station, which has ballooned from an initial $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a clear message from the administration to "clean up its act" before pursuing new initiatives.

END OF SUMMARY.
