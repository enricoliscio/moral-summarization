Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about NASA's new administrator and the moral framing involved. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects.

The article talks about NASA's shift from space exploration to cost-cutting under the new administrator, Sean O'Keefe. It mentions that O'Keefe is a financial expert, not a space enthusiast, which is a change from the previous administrator, Daniel Goldin. Goldin focused on cheaper, faster missions, but now the focus is on reducing the space station's costs, which have ballooned.

Moral framing here seems to involve criticism of NASA's direction. Words like "dysfunctional," "credibility," "failure," "morass," "neat stuff," "visionary," and "mandate" carry moral connotations. The article suggests that NASA's credibility is damaged, and the new administrator is more about accounting than exploration, which some see as a step back.

I need to identify the morally framed words first. They are: dysfunctional, credibility, failure, morass, neat, visionary, mandate. Each of these words carries a judgment or evaluation, so they're key to the moral framing.

Now, for the summary, I should include these words while condensing the article. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the change in leadership, the shift from exploration to cost-cutting, the criticism of the space station's budget issues, and the implications for NASA's future.

I'll make sure to preserve the moral framing by using those words. The summary should reflect the concern that NASA is moving away from its visionary goals towards more financial management, which some see as necessary but others as a loss of direction.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the leadership change, mention the shift in focus, discuss the budget issues, and conclude with the implications and criticism. Make sure to include the morally framed words naturally within the summary.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and includes all the necessary moral elements.

**Summary:**

NASA is undergoing a leadership shift, with Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, replacing Daniel Goldin. This change reflects a move from space exploration to cost-cutting, as the agency faces criticism for its dysfunctional space program and credibility issues, particularly with the bloated budget of the International Space Station. O'Keefe's appointment signals a focus on fiscal management over visionary exploration, a move seen by some as necessary but others as a step back. The agency's future under O'Keefe may involve scaling back projects, which could strain international partnerships. While some view this as a mandate for reform, others lament the loss of NASA's visionary goals, emphasizing the need for both financial accountability and deft diplomacy to navigate the fiscal morass and restore credibility.
