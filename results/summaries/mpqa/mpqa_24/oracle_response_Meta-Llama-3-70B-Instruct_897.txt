SUMMARY:

NASA's new mission is to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. The agency bid farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after 10 years in office, and President Bush nominated Sean O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, to replace him. Under Goldin, costs ballooned far beyond original estimates, especially with the International Space Station, which has become a fiscal morass. The project's costs have grown from $17.4 billion to more than $30 billion, and a task force concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the station is "not credible." O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before it can talk about the neat stuff it'd like to do. Fixing the problem will require not just accounting savvy, but also deft diplomacy, as international partners oppose scaling back the station.

END OF SUMMARY.
