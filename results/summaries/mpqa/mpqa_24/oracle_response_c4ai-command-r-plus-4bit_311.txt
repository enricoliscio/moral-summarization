SUMMARY: Forget space explorationâ€”the next NASA mission is to tackle soaring space-station costs and restore credibility to the agency. Outgoing administrator Daniel Goldin, with his "faster, better, cheaper" approach, has left the agency with a bloated budget, especially for the International Space Station, whose costs have ballooned to over $30 billion. The new nominee, Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, has his work cut out to clean up the fiscal mess and repair the agency's damaged reputation. This shift in focus from exploration to cost-cutting is indicative of a larger trend, with NASA's objectives becoming less visionary over time. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message: get your house in order, NASA, before we talk about any bold new initiatives. END OF SUMMARY.
