Alright, I need to summarize this article about NASA's new administrator. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about NASA's transition from Daniel Goldin to Sean O'Keefe. Goldin was known for his cost-cutting measures, like the "faster, better, cheaper" approach, which increased the number of spacecraft in development. However, the space program's credibility has been damaged, especially with the International Space Station's ballooning costs. The ISS went from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, and the Bush administration wanted to scale back involvement, which caused some international pushback.

Now, O'Keefe, who has a background in finance and management, is replacing Goldin. The article suggests that while he's not a space enthusiast, he might be the right person to fix NASA's financial issues. Some see this as a step back from visionary goals towards more fiscal responsibility.

I should include the main points: the change in leadership, Goldin's achievements and challenges, the ISS cost issues, O'Keefe's background, and the implications for NASA's future. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all the essential information without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: NASA is transitioning from Administrator Daniel Goldin to Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, as the agency faces challenges in credibility and cost management. Goldin's tenure saw successes like Mars exploration and cost-cutting measures, but the International Space Station (ISS) project exceeded its budget, sparking criticism. O'Keefe, with a background in finance, is seen as a solution to these fiscal issues. His appointment reflects a shift from visionary goals to financial accountability, though it may strain international partnerships over ISS reductions. END OF SUMMARY.
