SUMMARY: This news article discusses the resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin and the nomination of Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, as his replacement. The article highlights the challenges facing NASA, including soaring space-station costs and a dysfunctional space program. Under Goldin, NASA achieved successes in unmanned missions but faced criticism for cost overruns and credibility issues in manned spaceflight, particularly with the International Space Station. O'Keefe, known for his accounting skills and financial management experience, is expected to bring fiscal discipline to NASA. Analysts suggest that his appointment signals the administration's priority to address NASA's financial issues before pursuing more ambitious space missions. O'Keefe's confirmation by the Senate will determine his ability to address the fiscal challenges and restore NASA's credibility.
