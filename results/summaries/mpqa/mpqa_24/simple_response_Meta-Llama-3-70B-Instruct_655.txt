SUMMARY:

NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, brings a fiscal focus to the agency, replacing Daniel Goldin after 10 years. O'Keefe's background in budget management and financial oversight is seen as a necessary correction to NASA's "dysfunctional" space program, plagued by soaring costs and credibility issues. The International Space Station, a symbol of the agency's woes, has seen its costs balloon from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration to "clean up its act" before pursuing more ambitious projects. While some analysts believe O'Keefe's numbers-driven approach could restore the agency's credibility, others worry that it may stifle NASA's visionary goals. The moral imperative is clear: fiscal responsibility must come first, and only then can the agency pursue its loftier aspirations.

END OF SUMMARY.
