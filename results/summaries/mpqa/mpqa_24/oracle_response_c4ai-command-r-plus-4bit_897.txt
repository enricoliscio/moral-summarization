SUMMARY: The resignation of Daniel Goldin, NASA administrator, has brought to light the issues within the space program, particularly the soaring costs of the International Space Station, which have ballooned to over $30 billion. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take Goldin's place and tackle the financial mess. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message that NASA needs to clean up its act and get its costs under control before embarking on new missions. While the agency has had successes under Goldin, such as unmanned craft finding evidence of water on the moon, the credibility of the manned spaceflight program has been damaged by cost overruns and budget issues. Analysts believe that O'Keefe's financial expertise may be what NASA needs to get back on track, but it will also require diplomacy, as scaling back the station could violate international agreements. This new appointment highlights the need for fiscal responsibility and a return to credibility for NASA's space program.
END OF SUMMARY.
