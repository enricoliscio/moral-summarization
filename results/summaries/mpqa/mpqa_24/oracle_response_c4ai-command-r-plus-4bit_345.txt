SUMMARY: NASA faces a new mission to steer its soaring space-station costs back down and restore credibility to its dysfunctional space program. The agency bids farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach, but struggled with ballooned costs for the International Space Station, which have far exceeded original estimates, just as the space-shuttle program before it. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take over as administrator. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message that NASA must clean up its act and get its finances in order before it can focus on ambitious space exploration goals. Fixing the financial mess will require both accounting skills and diplomatic tact, as the task force's recommendations to scale back the station have stirred opposition from international partners. Analysts are hopeful that O'Keefe's financial expertise can help the agency blossom again, as it did under James Webb, but they also acknowledge that NASA's objectives have become less visionary, with a primary focus on budget cuts and disaster recovery.
END OF SUMMARY.
