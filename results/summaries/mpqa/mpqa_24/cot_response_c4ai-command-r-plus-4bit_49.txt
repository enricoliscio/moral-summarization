SUMMARY: Forget the soaring costs of NASA missions, the agency's new mission is to steer these costs back towards Earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. This is the legacy left by Daniel Goldin, who resigned after serving a record 10 years as administrator. To replace him, the White House has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a man known more for his financial prowess than his enthusiasm for space exploration. While Goldin's tenure saw unmanned craft find evidence of water on the moon and expand our understanding of Mars, the agency's credibility has taken a hit when it comes to manned spaceflight. The International Space Station, in particular, has seen its costs balloon far beyond original estimates. Early in his administration, President Bush planned to scale back US involvement, and a recent task force report concluded that NASA's cost estimates are not credible. If confirmed, O'Keefe will have to tackle this fiscal morass head-on, requiring not just accounting savvy but also deft diplomacy. Analysts are divided on how the agency will fare under O'Keefe, with some hoping for a return to the visionary days of the Apollo program under James Webb, and others noting the increasingly mundane mandates of recent administrators, from budget cuts to disaster recovery. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message: NASA must clean up its act before it can focus on the neat stuff. END OF SUMMARY.
