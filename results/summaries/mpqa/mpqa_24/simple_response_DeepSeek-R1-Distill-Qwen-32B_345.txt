Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin. The author seems to present a critical view, focusing on the shift from space exploration to cost-cutting and the potential downsides of that shift.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Goldin had a 10-year tenure and focused on reducing costs with the "faster, better, cheaper" approach. This led to some successes like finding water on the moon and Mars exploration. However, the space station's costs went over budget, damaging NASA's credibility.

O'Keefe, the new administrator, comes from a financial background, not space. The author suggests he's more about budgeting than exploration. The article mentions that while O'Keefe might fix the fiscal issues, he might not be the visionary NASA needs for future missions. There's a sense of loss here, that NASA is moving away from its ambitious roots towards just managing budgets.

I need to capture this shift and the moral implications. The summary should highlight that while cost-cutting is necessary, it might stifle innovation and exploration. The author seems to worry that NASA is losing its way by focusing too much on the fiscal side.

I'll structure the summary to mention Goldin's legacy, the issues with the space station, O'Keefe's background, and the potential consequences of his leadership. I'll make sure to include the critical view that NASA is moving away from its visionary past.

Let me check the word count. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll make sure each point is concise. Also, I should end with the note about the administration's message, emphasizing that NASA needs to clean up before more exciting projects.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements and maintain the critical tone about the shift in focus.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as Administrator Sean O'Keefe, a fiscal expert, replaces Daniel Goldin, who oversaw a decade of cost-cutting and achievements like finding water on the moon and advancing Mars exploration. However, the agency's credibility has suffered due to ballooning costs of the International Space Station, which have exceeded initial estimates. O'Keefe, with no space background, is seen as a bean counter rather than a visionary. While he may help address financial issues, critics worry NASA's focus on cost-cutting could stifle innovation and its historical role as a leader in space exploration. The administration's message is clear: NASA must first fix its fiscal problems before pursuing ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
