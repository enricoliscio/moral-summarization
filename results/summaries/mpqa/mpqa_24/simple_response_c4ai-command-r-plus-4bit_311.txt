SUMMARY: The resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin has raised questions about the future direction of the agency and its struggling space program. Goldin's 10-year tenure was marked by ambitious unmanned missions and cost-cutting measures, but the agency's credibility has been damaged by soaring costs and challenges in manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take over as administrator, signaling a focus on fiscal responsibility and management. O'Keefe faces the challenge of reining in costs without compromising international agreements and partnerships, requiring both financial acumen and diplomatic skill. Analysts suggest that O'Keefe's appointment could be a turning point for NASA, but the agency's objectives have shifted from visionary exploration to damage control. The focus now is on restoring credibility and addressing fiscal issues before embarking on new ventures. 

END OF SUMMARY.
