SUMMARY:
NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, has a tough task ahead of him: to steer the agency's soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to a dysfunctional space program. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, is not a space enthusiast, but he may be what the agency needs right now. Under his predecessor, Daniel Goldin, the agency's credibility has come under fire, especially with the International Space Station, whose costs have ballooned far beyond original estimates. O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do. He must fix the fiscal morass and navigate deft diplomacy to address international partners' concerns about scaling back the station. END OF SUMMARY.
