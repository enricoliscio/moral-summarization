SUMMARY:

NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency's space program, which has been plagued by soaring costs and a lack of vision. O'Keefe, a numbers expert with no prior experience in space exploration, is seen as a necessary change from his predecessor, Daniel Goldin, who was criticized for his "faster, better, cheaper" approach that led to ballooning costs and a loss of focus. The International Space Station, a symbol of the agency's dysfunction, is a major concern, with costs exceeding initial estimates by over $13 billion. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration that NASA must get its finances in order before pursuing ambitious projects. His diplomatic skills will be tested as he navigates international agreements and partnerships. The moral imperative is clear: NASA must prioritize accountability and responsibility before pursuing its lofty goals.

END OF SUMMARY.
