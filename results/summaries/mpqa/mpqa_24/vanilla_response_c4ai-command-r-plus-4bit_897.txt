SUMMARY: This news article discusses the resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin and the nomination of Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, as his replacement. The article highlights the challenges facing NASA, including soaring space-station costs and a dysfunctional space program. Under Goldin, NASA had success with unmanned craft finding evidence of water on the moon and inaugurating a long-term program to explore Mars. However, the agency's credibility has been damaged by cost overruns and issues with manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, is expected to bring accounting savvy and diplomacy to the role. Analysts predict that under O'Keefe, NASA could blossom as it did during the Apollo program under James Webb, another numbers-focused leader. However, the agency's objectives have shifted from visionary endeavors to more practical concerns. O'Keefe's appointment signals the administration's focus on fiscal responsibility before embarking on new missions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
