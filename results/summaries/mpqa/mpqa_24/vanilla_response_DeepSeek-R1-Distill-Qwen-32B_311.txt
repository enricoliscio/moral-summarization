Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about NASA's new administrator. The user wants a summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Daniel Goldin resigning after 10 years as NASA administrator. President Bush nominated Sean O'Keefe, who has a background in finance and management, not space. 

Goldin's tenure saw some successes like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but there were issues with cost overruns, especially with the International Space Station, which went way over budget. The Bush administration wanted to scale back involvement, causing some international pushback.

O'Keefe's role is to fix the financial issues and restore credibility. Some think he's the right choice, while others are skeptical. The summary needs to capture these points concisely.

I should structure it by mentioning the change in leadership, the reasons behind it, Goldin's achievements and problems, O'Keefe's background, and the challenges ahead. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and use clear, concise language.

SUMMARY: NASA is undergoing a leadership shift as Daniel Goldin resigns after a decade, and Sean O'Keefe, a finance expert, is nominated to replace him. Goldin's tenure saw successes like discovering water on the moon and exploring Mars, but the agency faced criticism over cost overruns, particularly with the International Space Station, which exceeded its budget from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. O'Keefe, with his background in financial management, is seen as a pragmatic choice to address NASA's fiscal challenges and restore credibility. His appointment reflects the administration's focus on fixing the agency's financial issues before pursuing new missions. END OF SUMMARY.
