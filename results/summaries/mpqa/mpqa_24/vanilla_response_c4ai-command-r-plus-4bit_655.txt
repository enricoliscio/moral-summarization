SUMMARY: After 10 years as NASA administrator, Daniel Goldin resigned, and President Bush nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take his place. Goldin's tenure saw successes in unmanned space missions but struggles with the costs of manned programs like the International Space Station. O'Keefe's appointment signals a focus on fiscal responsibility and addressing the space station's budget issues. Analysts suggest that O'Keefe's skills may be what NASA needs, comparing his appointment to that of James Webb, who oversaw the Apollo program. However, some question if O'Keefe's mandate reflects a diminishing vision for NASA, prioritizing budget control over exploration. Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society believes the administration is sending a message to NASA to get its house in order before discussing ambitious projects. O'Keefe's challenge will be to balance budget constraints with the agency's exploration goals. 

END OF SUMMARY.
