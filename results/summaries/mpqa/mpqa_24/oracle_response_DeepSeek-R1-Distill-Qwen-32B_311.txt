Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the words "ballooned," "disaster," and "clean." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin. It mentions the space station's costs ballooning, which is a key moral point. The previous administrator, Goldin, implemented cost-cutting measures but faced issues with manned spaceflight credibility. The space station's budget went way over, leading to criticism.

I should highlight that O'Keefe is a financial expert, not a space enthusiast, which is a shift. The article also mentions the opposition from international partners when scaling back the station, which ties into the "disaster" framing of past issues like the Challenger. 

I need to make sure to include the word "clean" as part of the administration's message to NASA to fix its act before moving forward. 

I'll structure the summary to mention the transition from Goldin to O'Keefe, the ballooning costs, the need for financial management, the credibility issues, and the administration's message to clean up NASA's act. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era under Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert replacing Daniel Goldin, as the agency grapples with soaring costs and a dysfunctional reputation. Goldin's tenure saw achievements like discovering water on the moon and expanding Mars exploration, but the International Space Station's budget ballooned from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, eroding credibility. O'Keefe, known for cost-cutting, may bring needed fiscal discipline but lacks a passion for space exploration. The agency's credibility is further strained as international partners oppose scaling back the station, fearing it violates agreements. Critics argue NASA's objectives have grown less visionary since the Apollo era, with O'Keefe's mandate to fix the space station seen as a step toward cleaning up the agency's act before tackling ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
