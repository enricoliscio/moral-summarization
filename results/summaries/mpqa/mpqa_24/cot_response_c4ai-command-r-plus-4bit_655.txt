SUMMARY:
The nomination of Sean O'Keefe as NASA administrator marks a shift in focus for the agency, prioritizing fiscal responsibility over space exploration. O'Keefe, a green-eyeshade bean counter, is tasked with steering soaring space-station costs back to earth and restoring credibility to a dysfunctional NASA. He replaces Daniel Goldin, who resigned after a decade of implementing a "faster, better, cheaper" approach that, while successful in unmanned missions, has come under fire for ballooning costs in manned spaceflight. The International Space Station, with costs surpassing $30 billion, is at the heart of the issue. O'Keefe's mandate is to fix the fiscal morass without violating international agreements, a challenge that requires not just accounting savvy but also deft diplomacy. Analysts are divided on the potential outcome: some predict a blossoming of the agency, while others note a decreasing vision, with O'Keefe's mandate being to simply clean up NASA's act rather than pursuing visionary goals.
END OF SUMMARY.
