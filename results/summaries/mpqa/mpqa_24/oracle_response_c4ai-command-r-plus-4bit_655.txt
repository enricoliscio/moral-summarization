SUMMARY: The resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin has brought to light the agency's financial woes and credibility issues, particularly regarding the International Space Station, whose costs have ballooned to over $30 billion. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert, to take Goldin's place, signaling a shift in focus from exploration to cost-cutting and management. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a necessary step to clean up NASA's fiscal mess and restore trust in the agency. However, scaling back the space station project may provoke opposition from international partners who argue that it violates agreements and limits their access to the station. The challenges facing O'Keefe highlight the changing priorities of NASA, moving away from visionary exploration and towards damage control in the wake of budgetary disasters.
END OF SUMMARY.
