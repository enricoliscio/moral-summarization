SUMMARY: New NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe faces the challenging task of steering the agency out of a fiscal morass, as costs for the International Space Station have ballooned to more than $30 billion. The agency's credibility has suffered in the face of such cost overruns, and the new nominee, a bean counter by trade, will need to employ both accounting savvy and diplomacy to address the issues. O'Keefe's appointment sends a clear message that NASA needs to clean up its act and get its budget in order before it can focus on ambitious space exploration initiatives. This shift in focus may be what the agency needs to restore its credibility and avoid future disasters. 

END OF SUMMARY.
