SUMMARY:

NASA is embarking on a new mission to restore credibility to its "dysfunctional" space program. After bidding farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a "consummate bean counter," to replace him. O'Keefe's mandate is to cut costs and fix the fiscal morass surrounding the International Space Station, whose costs have "ballooned" far beyond original estimates. The project's credibility has come under fire, and O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration to "clean up its act" before pursuing more ambitious goals. Under Goldin, the agency's objectives had become less visionary, and O'Keefe's task is to steer the agency back on track. With his financial expertise, O'Keefe may be what the agency needs to recover from its current "disaster." If confirmed, O'Keefe will have to navigate a complex web of international agreements and diplomatic relationships to fix the space station's problems.

END OF SUMMARY.
