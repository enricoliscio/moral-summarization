Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I need to understand the article's content and the underlying moral perspective.

The article talks about NASA's leadership change. Goldin is leaving after 10 years, and O'Keefe is taking over. The author seems critical of the shift from a visionary leader to a budget-focused one. The moral framing here is about the balance between fiscal responsibility and the pursuit of grand scientific goals.

I should capture that the author is concerned NASA is moving away from exploration towards just cost-cutting. The moral issue is whether focusing too much on the budget will stifle innovation and the agency's credibility. I need to highlight that O'Keefe's background is in finance, not space, which might not inspire the same level of exploration as previous leaders.

Also, the article mentions the International Space Station's cost overruns and international relations. The moral aspect here is the potential breakdown of international agreements if the station is scaled back. This could harm partnerships and the perception of the U.S. in space endeavors.

I should make sure the summary reflects these concerns, showing the tension between financial management and maintaining a visionary space program. It's important to note the criticism that NASA is losing its way by focusing too much on budgets and not enough on exploration.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include key points: leadership change, shift from exploration to budget-cutting, the impact on credibility and international relations, and the criticism about losing the visionary aspect.

Let me structure it by first introducing the change in leadership, then the shift in focus, followed by the challenges and criticisms, and conclude with the moral implication of prioritizing cost over exploration.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear, ensuring the moral framing is evident. The summary should convey that while financial management is necessary, it shouldn't overshadow the original purpose of NASA's ambitious projects.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise manner without losing the essence of the author's moral stance.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as it bids farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who oversaw a decade of achievements, including evidence of water on the moon and a Mars exploration program. However, the agency's credibility has been questioned due to soaring costs of the International Space Station and the space shuttle program. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a budget expert with no space background, to replace Goldin, signaling a shift from visionary exploration to fiscal management. Critics argue this move risks losing NASA's focus on ambitious science and international collaboration. While O'Keefe's expertise may help address the agency's financial woes, some fear it could undermine its legacy of innovation and global leadership in space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
