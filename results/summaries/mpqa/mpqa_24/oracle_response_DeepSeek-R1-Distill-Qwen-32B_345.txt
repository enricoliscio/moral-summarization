Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about NASA's leadership change while preserving the moral framing. They specifically mentioned that the author used words like "ballooned," "disaster," and "clean." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Daniel Goldin resigning and Sean O'Keefe taking over. Goldin focused on cost-cutting and had some successes, but there were issues with the space station's budget. O'Keefe is more of a financial manager, which might help with the fiscal issues but could affect the agency's image.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The costs "ballooned," which implies they got out of control. The Challenger disaster is mentioned, so I should include that as a negative event. The idea of "cleaning up" NASA's act is important, showing the need for reform.

I'll structure the summary to include these points: the transition from Goldin to O'Keefe, the fiscal problems with the space station, the use of "ballooned" and "disaster," and the need for NASA to clean up its act. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as Administrator Daniel Goldin resigns after 10 years, and Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, is nominated to replace him. Goldin's tenure saw successes like discovering water on the moon and advancing Mars exploration, but the agency's credibility suffered due to ballooning costs, particularly with the International Space Station, which has exceeded its budget by billions. O'Keefe, known for his fiscal expertise, is seen as a pragmatic choice to address these financial challenges, though he lacks a reputation as a space enthusiast. Critics argue that cutting the station's scope could violate international agreements, highlighting the need for both accounting skills and diplomacy. The shift reflects a broader trend in NASA's objectives, moving from visionary goals like the Apollo program to more practical, cost-focused missions. O'Keefe's appointment signals a need for NASA to clean up its fiscal and operational issues before pursuing ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
