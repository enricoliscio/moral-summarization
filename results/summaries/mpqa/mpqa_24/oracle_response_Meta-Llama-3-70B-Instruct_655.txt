SUMMARY: NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, faces a daunting task: to steer the agency's soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to a dysfunctional space program. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, replaces Daniel Goldin, who resigned after 10 years in office. Under Goldin, costs ballooned far beyond original estimates, especially with the International Space Station, now completing its first year of full-time crews. The project's costs have ballooned from an initial $17.4 billion to more than $30 billion. A task force on the project's budget concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the "core" station is "not credible." O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before it can talk about the neat stuff it'd like to do. Fixing the problem requires not just accounting savvy, but also deft diplomacy, as international partners oppose scaling back the station. O'Keefe's mandate is to fix the space station, a far cry from the agency's previous visionary objectives. END OF SUMMARY.
