Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: "ballooned," "disaster," and "clean." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses NASA's transition from Administrator Daniel Goldin to Sean O'Keefe, highlighting the shift from a focus on space exploration to cost-cutting and credibility restoration. Goldin's tenure saw some successes but also issues like cost overruns in the International Space Station. O'Keefe's background is in finance, which might help in addressing these fiscal issues.

I need to make sure the summary includes the specified moral words. "Ballooned" refers to the costs increasing beyond estimates. "Disaster" relates to past incidents like the Challenger accident. "Clean" is about restoring NASA's credibility.

I'll structure the summary to mention the transition, the cost issues (using "ballooned"), the previous disaster (Challenger), and the need for NASA to clean up its act. I'll also include O'Keefe's role in addressing these problems.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words. I'll check that the moral words are included and that the summary captures the essence of the article's framing.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as it bids farewell to Administrator Daniel Goldin, whose tenure saw both achievements and challenges. Under Goldin, the agency made strides in unmanned exploration, such as finding water on the moon and advancing Mars missions, but its credibility in manned spaceflight, particularly the International Space Station, has been tarnished. Costs for the station have ballooned from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, sparking criticism and a task force recommendation to scale back the project. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, to replace Goldin, signaling a shift from space exploration to fiscal accountability. O'Keefe’s appointment reflects the administration’s demand for NASA to clean up its act, addressing budgetary issues and restoring credibility before pursuing ambitious goals. Analysts compare O'Keefe to James Webb, who led NASA during the Apollo era, but note the agency’s objectives have since become less visionary. The transition highlights a need for both financial expertise and diplomatic finesse to navigate the space station’s fiscal morass and potential international disputes. END OF SUMMARY.
