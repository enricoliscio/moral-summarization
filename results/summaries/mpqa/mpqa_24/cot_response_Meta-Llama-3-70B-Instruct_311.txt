SUMMARY:
NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency's "dysfunctional" space program. With a background in finance, O'Keefe is expected to bring a "consummate" approach to cutting costs, particularly with the International Space Station, which has seen its costs "balloon" to over $30 billion. The agency's "credibility" has been called into question, especially with the space shuttle program, and O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a "clear" message from the administration to "clean up its act." O'Keefe's "mandate" is to fix the space station's fiscal woes, which requires not only accounting savvy but also "deft" diplomacy to navigate international agreements. If successful, NASA may once again be able to focus on "neat" and "visionary" projects. END OF SUMMARY.
