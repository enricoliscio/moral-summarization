Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about NASA's new administrator. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about NASA replacing Daniel Goldin with Sean O'Keefe. Goldin was there for 10 years, and now O'Keefe is coming in. The main issues seem to be the high costs of the International Space Station and the need to fix NASA's credibility. 

Under Goldin, NASA did some good things like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but they also had budget problems. The space station's costs went way over, and the Bush administration wanted to scale back. There was a task force that said NASA's estimates weren't credible, and this caused some international pushback.

O'Keefe's background is in finance, not space, which might help with the budget issues. Some people think he's what NASA needs now, while others worry it might not be visionary. The article mentions that O'Keefe's focus is on fixing the space station, which is a big fiscal problem.

So, the summary should cover the change in leadership, the issues with the space station's budget, and the implications of O'Keefe's background. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me structure it: introduce the change, mention Goldin's achievements and problems, O'Keefe's background, the fiscal issues, and the potential impact. Make sure to highlight that the focus is now on cost-cutting and credibility rather than exploration.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, mention the international implications briefly. Okay, I think I have a good outline for the summary.

SUMMARY: NASA is set to undergo a leadership change as President Bush nominates Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, to replace outgoing administrator Daniel Goldin. Goldin's tenure saw achievements like discovering water on the moon and advancing Mars exploration, but the agency's credibility was tarnished by ballooning costs of the International Space Station (ISS), which exceeded initial estimates by over $12 billion. O'Keefe, with a background in finance, is seen as a potential fix for NASA's fiscal challenges. However, his nomination has sparked concerns about a lack of visionary leadership, with critics noting his focus may be more on cost-cutting than exploration. The ISS project has faced criticism for its budget overruns and international disagreements over scaling back its scope. O'Keefe's appointment signals a shift toward financial accountability, but analysts question whether this will restore NASA's credibility or stifle its ambitious goals. END OF SUMMARY.
