SUMMARY: After 10 years as NASA administrator, Daniel Goldin has resigned, and President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, to replace him. O'Keefe, a budget expert, faces the challenge of steering soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restoring credibility to NASA's manned spaceflight program, particularly the International Space Station, which has experienced significant cost overruns. Under Goldin, NASA achieved successes in unmanned craft exploration, but the agency's credibility has been damaged by cost overruns and management issues in manned spaceflight. O'Keefe's appointment signals the administration's focus on fiscal responsibility and management reform at NASA before pursuing more ambitious goals. Analysts believe that O'Keefe's budget expertise and diplomatic skills may be what the agency needs, and they draw comparisons to James Webb, another "numbers guy" who led NASA during the Apollo program. However, some worry that the agency's objectives have become less visionary, with cost-cutting taking precedence over exploration. Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society sums up the sentiment: "NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do." END OF SUMMARY.
