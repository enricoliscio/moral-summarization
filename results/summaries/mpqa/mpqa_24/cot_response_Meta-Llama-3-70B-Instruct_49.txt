SUMMARY:
NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency's "dysfunctional" space program. With a background in finance, O'Keefe is expected to bring a "consummate" approach to managing the agency's soaring costs, particularly with the International Space Station, which has seen its costs balloon to over $30 billion. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a clear message from the administration that NASA needs to "clean up its act" before pursuing more ambitious projects. Under his predecessor, Daniel Goldin, the agency's objectives had become less "visionary" and more focused on cost-cutting. O'Keefe's challenge will be to implement a more fiscally responsible approach while maintaining the agency's "credibility" and avoiding violations of international agreements. If successful, NASA may be able to return to its "neat" and ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
