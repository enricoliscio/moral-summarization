SUMMARY: This news article discusses the resignation of NASA administrator Daniel Goldin and the nomination of Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, as his replacement. The article highlights the challenges facing NASA, including soaring space-station costs and a credibility crisis. Goldin's "faster, better, cheaper" approach to cost-cutting is credited with increasing the number of spacecraft and missions but is also associated with cost overruns and credibility issues, particularly with the International Space Station. O'Keefe, a numbers guy with a background in finance and budgeting, is expected to bring accounting savvy and diplomacy to the agency. Analysts have mixed reactions, with some hopeful that O'Keefe will restore NASA's credibility and others noting the shift from visionary objectives to fiscal concerns. The appointment signals the administration's priority for NASA to address its financial issues before embarking on new missions.
END OF SUMMARY.
