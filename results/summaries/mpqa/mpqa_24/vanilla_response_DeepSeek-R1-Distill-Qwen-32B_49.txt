Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article about NASA's new administrator. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about NASA's transition from Daniel Goldin to Sean O'Keefe. Goldin had a 10-year tenure and focused on cost-cutting with a "faster, better, cheaper" approach. This led to some successes like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but also issues with the International Space Station's budget ballooning beyond expectations. The ISS project went from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, which has hurt NASA's credibility.

Now, Sean O'Keefe, who's more of a financial expert, is taking over. He's not a space enthusiast but has experience in budget management. The article mentions that his appointment signals the administration's focus on fixing NASA's financial issues before considering more ambitious projects. There are concerns about international relations, especially with Canada, who might oppose scaling back the ISS.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I should include the transition, Goldin's achievements and issues, O'Keefe's background, the focus on budget and credibility, and the implications for future missions.

Let me structure it: start with the change in leadership, mention Goldin's legacy and the ISS problems, introduce O'Keefe and his role, and conclude with the implications for NASA's future.

I should make sure the summary is concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail. Also, the tone should be neutral, reflecting both the challenges and potential opportunities under O'Keefe.

Okay, I think I have a clear outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows logically.

SUMMARY: NASA is undergoing a leadership change as Administrator Daniel Goldin, who served for 10 years, has resigned. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert with no space background, to replace him. Goldin's tenure saw successes like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but the agency's credibility suffered due to ballooning costs of the International Space Station (ISS), which exceeded initial estimates from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. O'Keefe, known for his budget management skills, is expected to address these financial challenges. His appointment signals a shift toward fiscal responsibility, with the administration emphasizing the need for NASA to "clean up its act" before pursuing new missions. Critics argue that scaling back the ISS could harm international partnerships, but some analysts believe O'Keefe could revitalize NASA, as previous financial leaders like James Webb did during the Apollo era. END OF SUMMARY.
