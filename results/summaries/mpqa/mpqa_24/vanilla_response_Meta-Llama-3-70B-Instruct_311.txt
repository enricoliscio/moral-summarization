SUMMARY:

NASA is entering a new era with the nomination of Sean O'Keefe as its new administrator, replacing Daniel Goldin who resigned after 10 years in office. O'Keefe, a financial expert with no background in space exploration, is tasked with restoring credibility to the agency and cutting costs. Under Goldin, NASA made significant progress in unmanned spaceflight, but its manned spaceflight program, particularly the International Space Station, has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. The station's costs have ballooned from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, and a recent task force report concluded that NASA's cost estimate for completing the station is not credible. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration that NASA needs to fix its financial issues before pursuing new initiatives. His challenge will be to balance cost-cutting with diplomacy, as international partners are opposed to scaling back the station's scope.

END OF SUMMARY.
