Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about NASA's new administrator. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article talks about NASA's mission shift. They're moving away from space shuttles and telescopes to focus on reducing costs and restoring credibility. The outgoing administrator, Daniel Goldin, had a 10-year tenure. President Bush is replacing him with Sean O'Keefe, who has a background in finance, not space. This is a significant change.

The article mentions that O'Keefe isn't known as a space enthusiast, but he might be what NASA needs now. Under Goldin, there were achievements like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but there were also cost overruns, especially with the International Space Station. The ISS costs went from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, and the Bush administration wanted to scale back involvement.

O'Keefe's challenge is to manage the fiscal issues without violating international agreements. Some analysts compare him to James Webb, who successfully led NASA during the Apollo era, but others note that NASA's goals have become less visionary over time.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to be about the need for fiscal responsibility and leadership to fix NASA's issues before considering new missions. The summary should highlight the shift from a space enthusiast to a financial manager, the cost problems, and the implications for NASA's future.

I'll structure the summary to include the change in leadership, the reasons behind it, the challenges O'Keefe faces, and the implications for NASA's credibility and future missions. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and covers all essential aspects while preserving the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as President Bush appoints Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, to replace outgoing administrator Daniel Goldin. O'Keefe, known for his fiscal expertise rather than space enthusiasm, is tasked with addressing soaring costs and restoring credibility to NASA's struggling space program. Under Goldin, NASA achieved milestones like finding water on the moon and advancing Mars exploration, but the International Space Station (ISS) project has suffered from massive cost overruns, rising from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion. The Bush administration had planned to scale back U.S. involvement in the ISS, sparking international concerns over treaty obligations. O'Keefe's appointment signals a focus on financial management and diplomacy to resolve the fiscal crisis. Analysts compare his potential impact to James Webb's leadership during NASA's Apollo heyday, though critics argue NASA's goals have become less visionary over time. O'Keefe's challenge is to balance budgetary constraints with international commitments, setting the stage for future missions. END OF SUMMARY.
