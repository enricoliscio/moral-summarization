SUMMARY:
NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, faces a daunting task of restoring credibility to the agency's space program, which has been deemed dysfunctional. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, replaces Daniel Goldin, who implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach that has been criticized for its lack of credibility. The agency's costs, particularly with the International Space Station, have ballooned far beyond original estimates, creating a fiscal morass. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a clear message from the administration that NASA needs to clean up its act before pursuing more ambitious projects. His mandate is to fix the space station, which requires not only accounting savvy but also deft diplomacy to navigate international agreements. If successful, NASA could blossom under O'Keefe's leadership, but for now, the focus is on restoring credibility and fiscal responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
