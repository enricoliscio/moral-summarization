Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin. Goldin was known for his "faster, better, cheaper" approach, which increased the number of spacecraft but also led to issues with the International Space Station's costs. The ISS went over budget, and the Bush administration wanted to scale back involvement. O'Keefe's background is in finance, not space, which some think is needed to fix NASA's budget problems. However, others worry this might make NASA focus too much on cost-cutting and less on exploration.

The moral framing seems to be about the balance between fiscal responsibility and the visionary goals of NASA. The article questions whether focusing on budget cuts will harm NASA's ability to pursue ambitious projects.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing O'Keefe's appointment, mention Goldin's legacy, the ISS cost issues, and the administration's priorities. I'll also touch on the concerns about losing focus on exploration.

Let me structure it: Introduction of O'Keefe, background of Goldin, the ISS problem, administration's shift towards cost management, and the debate about whether this is good or bad for NASA's future.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure to highlight the moral dilemma between financial management and visionary missions.

Alright, putting it all together now.

SUMMARY: NASA has appointed Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, as its new administrator, replacing Daniel Goldin, who oversaw a decade of cost-cutting and increased spacecraft development. However, Goldin's tenure also saw the International Space Station's costs escalate beyond initial estimates, sparking criticism. O'Keefe's background in finance, rather than space exploration, signals a shift toward fiscal management, addressing the agency's credibility issues. Critics worry this focus on budgeting might overshadow NASA's visionary goals, akin to the Apollo era. While some believe O'Keefe could revitalize the agency, others fear a loss of ambition in space exploration. The appointment reflects the administration's priority to fix NASA's financial issues before considering future projects. END OF SUMMARY.
