SUMMARY:

NASA is set to embark on a new mission under a new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, who has been nominated by President Bush to replace Daniel Goldin. O'Keefe, a former Pentagon chief financial officer, is seen as a numbers expert who can help steer the agency back on track after a decade of soaring space-station costs and a loss of credibility. Goldin's "faster, better, cheaper" approach led to unmanned craft finding evidence of water on the moon and inaugurating a long-term program to explore Mars, but manned spaceflight has been plagued by cost overruns, particularly with the International Space Station. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a message from the administration that NASA needs to clean up its act before pursuing more ambitious projects. His task will require not only accounting savvy but also diplomatic skills to navigate international agreements and partnerships.

END OF SUMMARY.
