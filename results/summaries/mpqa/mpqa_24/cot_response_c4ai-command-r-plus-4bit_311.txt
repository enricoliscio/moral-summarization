SUMMARY:
The nomination of Sean O'Keefe as the new administrator of NASA marks a shift in focus for the agency, prioritizing cost-cutting and accountability over ambitious space exploration. The agency's credibility has been damaged by soaring costs for the International Space Station, with the project's budget ballooning far beyond original estimates. O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, may be just what NASA needs to restore credibility to its dysfunctional space program. Under his predecessor, Daniel Goldin, NASA achieved notable unmanned craft successes, but the agency's manned spaceflight program has faced significant challenges and cost overruns. Fixing the fiscal morass of the space station project will require not just accounting savvy but also deft diplomacy, as international partners have expressed opposition to any scaling back of the station's scope. Analysts are hopeful that under O'Keefe's leadership, NASA can blossom again as it did under another numbers guy, James Webb, during the Apollo program. However, the agency's objectives have become less visionary, with O'Keefe's primary mandate being to fix the space station's budget issues before discussing more neat exploration initiatives.
