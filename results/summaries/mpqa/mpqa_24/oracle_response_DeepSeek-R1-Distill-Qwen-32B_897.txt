Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: "ballooned," "disaster," and "clean." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about NASA's new administrator, Sean O'Keefe, replacing Daniel Goldin. The key issues are soaring costs, especially with the International Space Station, which have gone way over budget—using "ballooned" here makes sense. 

Goldin's tenure had some successes, like finding water on the moon and exploring Mars, but the manned spaceflight, particularly the ISS, has had credibility issues. The costs have skyrocketed, which ties into "ballooned." The mention of the Challenger disaster is a "disaster" point, so I need to include that context. 

O'Keefe's background is in finance, not space exploration, which is a shift. The article mentions that he's not a space enthusiast but might be what NASA needs now. The moral framing here is about cleaning up NASA's act, so "clean" should be included to show the administration's message.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the transition from a visionary approach to a cost-cutting one, emphasizing the ballooned costs and the need for cleanup. I'll also mention the ISS issues and the international implications, showing the complexity of the problem. 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all the moral elements. I'll start with the change in leadership, mention Goldin's achievements and the ISS problems, introduce O'Keefe's role, and conclude with the administration's message about cleaning up NASA before considering future missions.

SUMMARY: NASA faces a new era as President Bush appoints Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert, to replace administrator Daniel Goldin. Goldin's tenure saw successes like discovering water on the moon and advancing Mars exploration, but the agency's credibility suffered due to ballooning costs, particularly with the International Space Station, which has exceeded its original $17.4 billion budget, now over $30 billion. O'Keefe, known for his financial expertise, is tasked with addressing this fiscal crisis, which has led to质疑 from international partners. His appointment signals a shift from visionary space exploration to cost-cutting measures, reflecting the administration's message that NASA must clean up its act before pursuing ambitious projects. END OF SUMMARY.
