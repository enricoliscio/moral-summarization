SUMMARY:

NASA is embarking on a new mission to restore credibility to its space program, which has been plagued by soaring costs and dysfunction. The agency bid farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after 10 years in office, and President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, a consummate bean counter, to replace him. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a clear message from the administration that NASA needs to clean up its act before pursuing new initiatives. Under Goldin, the agency's costs ballooned, particularly with the International Space Station, which has exceeded its original estimates by over $13 billion. O'Keefe's task will be to steer the agency back towards fiscal responsibility, which may require difficult decisions, including scaling back the space station. This move is seen as a necessary step towards restoring credibility to the agency, which has lost its way since its Apollo-program heyday. With O'Keefe at the helm, NASA may finally get its priorities in order and focus on its core mission.

END OF SUMMARY.
