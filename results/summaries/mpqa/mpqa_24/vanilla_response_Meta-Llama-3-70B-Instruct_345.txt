SUMMARY:

NASA is set to undergo a significant change in leadership with the nomination of Sean O'Keefe as the new administrator, replacing Daniel Goldin who resigned after 10 years in office. O'Keefe, a former Pentagon chief financial officer, is tasked with restoring credibility to the space agency and addressing the soaring costs of the International Space Station. The station's costs have ballooned to over $30 billion, far exceeding initial estimates. O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a clear message from the administration to clean up NASA's act before pursuing new initiatives. Under Goldin, NASA achieved several milestones, including finding evidence of water on the moon and inaugurating a program to explore Mars. However, the agency's credibility has been questioned, particularly with regards to manned spaceflight. O'Keefe's background in finance and management is seen as a positive step towards addressing NASA's fiscal challenges.
