Alright, I need to summarize this news article about NASA's new administrator. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about Daniel Goldin resigning after 10 years as NASA administrator. He was replaced by Sean O'Keefe, who has a background in finance and management, not space exploration. The main issues at NASA are high costs, especially with the International Space Station, which has gone over budget. Goldin tried to make things cheaper with a "faster, better, cheaper" approach, but manned missions, particularly the space station, have had credibility issues.

O'Keefe's appointment is seen as a shift towards cost-cutting and financial management. Some think he's the right person to fix NASA's fiscal problems, but others worry it might limit future ambitious projects. The space station's budget has ballooned, and there's international opposition to scaling it back. The summary should highlight these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning Goldin's resignation and O'Keefe's background. Then, note the cost issues with the space station and the shift in NASA's focus. Mention the "faster, better, cheaper" approach and the skepticism about future projects. Conclude with the administration's message about NASA needing to fix its finances before new missions.

Let me make sure the summary is clear and hits all the main points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward.

SUMMARY: NASA is transitioning under new leadership as Administrator Daniel Goldin resigns after 10 years, replaced by Sean O'Keefe, a financial expert with no space background. O'Keefe, former Pentagon CFO, is seen as a cost-cutter, contrasting with Goldin's legacy of unmanned successes and the "faster, better, cheaper" approach. NASA faces criticism over the International Space Station's ballooning costs, from $17.4 billion to over $30 billion, and a task force has questioned its credibility. O'Keefe's appointment signals a focus on fiscal management, though some worry it may limit ambitious projects. The agency's future under him remains uncertain, with challenges in balancing budget constraints and international partnerships. END OF SUMMARY.
