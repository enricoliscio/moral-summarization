SUMMARY: On December 9, Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weaponry dictated international relations. In a statement marking the "international day for human rights," the IHRC lamented the gap between the numerous documents promoting human rights and the reality of ongoing violations. The statement called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of various human rights, including political, associational, and women's rights, as outlined in the international declaration for human rights and advocated by divine religions. The IHRC regretted that the provisions of the declaration remain unfulfilled, despite the heavy losses incurred by humanity during devastating world wars, which taught the importance of respecting human rights for any progress. The statement highlighted the Durban international conference against racism as a turning point in the campaign for human rights. It condemned injustices against the Palestinian people and violations against political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women globally. While the September 11 terrorist attacks united nations and religions in condemning terrorism, certain countries' reliance on military power and disregard for civilian human rights were criticized. Statesmen were urged to heed religious teachings on human rights respect, emphasizing that peace cannot exist without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect human rights. She denounced Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
