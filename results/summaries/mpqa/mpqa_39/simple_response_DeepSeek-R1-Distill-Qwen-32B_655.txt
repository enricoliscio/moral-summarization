Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the query again to make sure I understand it correctly. They provided an article from IRNA about the Islamic Human Rights Commission's statement on human rights. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, that keeps the moral perspective the author had.

First, I need to identify the main points of the article. The IHRC is expressing concern about the return of force in international relations. They mention the International Day for Human Rights and the numerous documents and efforts to promote human rights, but note that these haven't been fully realized. They highlight the Durban conference as a turning point and deplore injustices against Palestinians and others. They also mention the UN's call for Israel to stop attacks and allow monitors.

I should structure the summary to include these points, emphasizing the moral aspects like the failure to implement human rights despite efforts, the call for prohibiting discrimination and torture, and the criticism of using military force. I also need to mention the UN's involvement to show international efforts.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the IHRC's concern, then the history of human rights efforts, the current failures, specific injustices, and the call for respect based on religious teachings. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but thorough.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the IHRC's statement on the International Day for Human Rights. Mention the 50 years of experience leading to human rights documents. Note the failure to materialize these rights. Highlight the Durban conference as a significant event. Then address the injustices against Palestinians and others. Include the call for respecting human rights through religious teachings. Finally, mention the UN's call to Israel to stop attacks and allow monitors.

I should check the word count as I go. Let me see, each sentence adds up, so I'll need to make sure each point is covered succinctly without unnecessary details. Also, preserve the moral framing by emphasizing the failure to uphold rights despite efforts and the need for respect and peace.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral perspective. Time to put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weaponry in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite decades of efforts to promote human rights through numerous documents and cultural perspectives, the IHRC lamented the failure to materialize these rights globally. It emphasized the need to prohibit discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, while honoring political, women's, and children's rights as outlined in international declarations and divine religions. The IHRC highlighted the Durban conference against racism as a turning point for human rights but criticized the ongoing injustices against Palestinians, journalists, religious minorities, and others. It also condemned the use of military power by certain countries, advocating for peace and respect for human rights based on religious teachings. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to cease attacks on Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings. END OF SUMMARY.
