Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressing concerns about the return of force in international relations. They're marking the International Day for Human Rights on December 10. 

They mention that after 50 years of experience and heavy losses, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. But despite all these efforts, human rights are still being violated. The IHRC is calling for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the honoring of various human rights, including women's rights and those outlined in the international declaration.

They also regret that the provisions of the declaration haven't been realized. The article mentions the Durban conference against racism as a turning point. The IHRC condemns the injustice against Palestinians and violations against political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. They note that all nations condemned the September 11 attacks but some countries are still using military force, which tramples human rights.

Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner, is calling on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors. She condemns Israeli attacks on Palestinian activists.

So, the main points are: IHRC's concerns about force in international relations, the failure to implement human rights despite many documents, the Durban conference, violations against various groups, the September 11 attacks leading to some unity but also continued military actions, and the UN's call to Israel.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include the key entities: IHRC, Mary Robinson, the issues they're highlighting, and the calls to action. I'll structure it to first mention the IHRC's concerns, then the Durban conference, the violations, the September 11 context, and Robinson's call to Israel. Make sure it's concise and flows well.
