SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the return to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations, in a statement issued on the occasion of International Human Rights Day. The statement lamented the gap between the ideals of human rights, as set forth in numerous international documents, and the reality of ongoing human rights violations around the world. It highlighted the importance of respecting human rights for achieving peace and security, a sentiment echoed by religious teachings. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of political, associative, and women's rights. It also denounced the injustice against the Palestinian people and human rights abuses against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain regions. The statement further urged world leaders to prioritize human rights, as recommended by divine religions, to establish a peaceful and just global community. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson echoed these sentiments, calling on Israel to cease its military actions against Palestinians and respect their human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
