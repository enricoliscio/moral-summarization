SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the resurgence of force and violence in international relations, undermining human rights. On the International Day for Human Rights, the IHRC urged for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The commission lamented that despite numerous documents and international agreements, human rights violations persist, causing heavy losses and suffering to humanity. The IHRC condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The commission emphasized that peace and security can only be achieved by respecting human rights, and urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians.
