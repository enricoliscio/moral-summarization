SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expresses grave concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations, overshadowing human rights. The statement, marking Human Rights Day, laments the unfulfilled promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite numerous documents and conferences promoting human rights. The IHRC calls for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of political, associational, and women's rights. It highlights the injustice against Palestinians and human rights abuses worldwide, including those of journalists and religious minorities. The statement decries certain countries' reliance on military power and disregard for civilian human rights, urging statesmen to embrace the teachings of religions that respect human rights. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson adds her voice, calling on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect international law. The IHRC and Robinson emphasize the need for peace, justice, and the protection of human rights for all, with the IHRC drawing attention to the wisdom of divine religions on this front.
