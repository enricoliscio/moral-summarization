Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided a specific list of morally charged words that I need to include as much as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The IHRC is concerned about the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, especially around Human Rights Day. They mention the numerous documents signed to promote human rights but note that these haven't been materialized. There's a focus on issues like discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. They also highlight the Durban conference as a turning point and criticize countries using military power, leading to human rights violations. Mary Robinson from the UN calls for Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by mentioning the IHRC's concern about force and weapons, then talk about the documents signed to honor human rights. I'll note that these haven't been materialized and list some of the violations. I'll include the Durban conference as a turning point and the call for respecting human rights through religious teachings. I'll also mention the UN's call to Israel to stop bombing and the broader issue of using military power leading to trampling of rights. Finally, I'll emphasize that peace can't be achieved without honoring human rights.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make each sentence cover multiple points. I'll structure it to flow logically from the IHRC's statement to the broader implications and the UN's call. I'll ensure that each morally framed word is used naturally within the context.

SUMMARY: The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. Despite numerous documents formulated to honor human rights after decades of losses and suffering, the IHRC regrets that these provisions remain unmaterialized. Discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention persist, alongside violations of political, women's, and children's rights. The IHRC emphasized the need for prohibition of such practices and called for honoring human rights as advocated by divine religions. It deplored injustice against the Palestinian nation and criticized countries resorting to military power, which tramples human rights. The IHRC also highlighted the 2001 Durban conference as a turning point in the fight against racism and terrorism. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson urged Israel to halt bombing in the West Bank and Gaza, denouncing targeted killings of Palestinians. The IHRC stressed that peace and security cannot be achieved without honoring human rights, calling on statesmen to heed religious teachings. END OF SUMMARY.
