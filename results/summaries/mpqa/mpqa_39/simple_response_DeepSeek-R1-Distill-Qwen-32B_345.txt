Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author provided. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow specific formatting with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressing concerns on the International Day for Human Rights. They mention the efforts made over the years to promote human rights through various documents and the progress made, but also highlight the ongoing issues like discrimination, torture, and human rights violations in places like Palestine. They also touch on the response to 9/11 and the use of military power, as well as UN Commissioner Mary Robinson's call to action against Israel's actions.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance: the emphasis on human rights, the critique of military actions, and the call for respecting human rights through religious teachings. I should structure the summary to include the key points: IHRC's concerns, the importance of human rights, the Durban conference as a turning point, the issues in Palestine, the response to terrorism, and the UN's call to action.

I'll start by introducing IHRC and their concerns. Then, mention the historical context of human rights efforts. Highlight the Durban conference and the ongoing violations. Address the issue of military force and the moral call for peace. Finally, include Robinson's statement about Israel and the Palestinian territories.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure the moral framing is clear. Also, watch the word count to stay under 200 words. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all key points are included without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite decades of efforts to promote human rights through numerous documents and cultural perspectives, the IHRC noted that the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remain unfulfilled. The organization condemned discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, emphasizing the need to honor human rights, including political, women's, and minority rights. It highlighted the Durban conference on racism as a pivotal moment for human rights but criticized the use of military power by some nations, which tramples on civilian rights. The IHRC also condemned human rights violations against Palestinians, journalists, and religious minorities, urging statesmen to follow religious teachings promoting peace and justice. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings of Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
