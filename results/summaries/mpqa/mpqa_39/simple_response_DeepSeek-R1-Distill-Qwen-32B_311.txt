Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission in Tehran expressing concerns on Human Rights Day. They're worried that force is becoming dominant again in international relations. They mention that after 50 years and heavy losses from wars, the international community has created many documents to promote human rights, but these aren't being implemented. They call for an end to discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and emphasize the importance of human rights as per divine religions.

They also talk about the Durban conference as a turning point and criticize the use of military power by some countries, which violates human rights. They mention support for Palestinian rights and the UN's call for Israel to stop attacks.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral tone intact. I should highlight the IHRC's concerns, the failure to implement human rights despite efforts, the role of religion, the criticism of military actions, and the call for peace through respecting human rights. Also, include the UN's stance on Israel.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without losing the moral emphasis. Let me structure it step by step, starting with the IHRC's statement, their concerns, the historical context, the call to action, and the UN's involvement.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, like the divine origins of human rights and the consequences of ignoring them. Make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next, covering all the key moral arguments presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. Despite decades of efforts and numerous documents to promote human rights, the IHRC regrets that these principles remain unfulfilled. It emphasizes the need to prohibit discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, while honoring rights enshrined in international declarations and divine religions. The IHRC highlights the Durban conference as a turning point for human rights but criticizes the use of military power by some nations, which tramples on civilians' rights. It calls for peace through respecting human rights, as taught by religious traditions. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson urges Israel to stop attacks on Palestinians and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings. The IHRC stresses that lasting peace cannot be achieved without honoring human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
