SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations. In a statement marking the "international day for human rights," the IHRC highlighted the numerous documents formulated by the international community to honor human rights, following devastating wars and heavy losses. The statement called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights for all, as recommended by divine religions. Unfortunately, the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been fully materialized, and the world continues to witness injustice and violation of human rights, particularly against the Palestinian nation and political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain parts of the world. The IHRC lamented that despite global condemnation of the September 11 terrorist attacks, certain countries continue to resort to military power and trample upon the human rights of civilians. The organization urged statesmen to abide by religious teachings that call for respect for human rights and emphasized that peace cannot be achieved without honoring them. Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and to respect international law. She denounced Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killing of Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
