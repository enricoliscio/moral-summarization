SUMMARY:
The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. In a statement marking the "international day for human rights," the IHRC lamented that despite numerous documents and declarations promoting human rights, the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been fully realized. The IHRC regretted the injustices and violations of human rights against Palestinians, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in some parts of the world. They also condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks and urged statesmen to respect human rights teachings, emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without honoring them. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and to respect the human rights of civilians, denouncing their targeted killing of Palestinians. The IHRC statement called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the honoring of political rights, women's rights, and the rights recommended by divine religions.
