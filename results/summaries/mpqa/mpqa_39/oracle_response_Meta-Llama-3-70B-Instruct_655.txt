SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a period where force and weapon have the last say in international relations, highlighting the importance of honoring human rights. The IHRC noted that despite numerous documents signed to promote human rights, provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized. The statement regretted the heavy human losses suffered in devastating world wars and condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation, violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists and urging a halt to targeted killings.
