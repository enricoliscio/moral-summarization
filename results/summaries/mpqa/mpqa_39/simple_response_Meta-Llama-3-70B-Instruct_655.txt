SUMMARY:

The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran has expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and agreements, human rights continue to be violated, including discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC urges the prohibition of such violations and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The statement regrets that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, and laments the injustices against the Palestinian nation, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The IHRC calls on statesmen to heed religious teachings respecting human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot be established without honoring human rights.
