SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expresses grave concern about the world returning to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations. On Human Rights Day, the IHRC emphasizes the importance of respecting human rights, particularly in light of the devastating losses humanity has endured. Despite numerous documents and declarations promoting human rights, discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention persist, with violations against Palestinians, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, women, and children. The IHRC laments the regression towards militarism and the trampling of civilian human rights, urging statesmen to abide by religious teachings that call for respect and peace. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson adds her voice, calling on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect international law. The IHRC and Robinson stand united in their call for an end to injustice and a return to the principles of human rights, peace, and security for all. END OF SUMMARY.
