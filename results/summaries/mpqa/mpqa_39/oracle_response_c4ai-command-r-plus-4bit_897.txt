SUMMARY: On the international day of human rights, the Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations. The IHRC statement lamented the gap between the ideals of human rights, as outlined in numerous international documents, and the reality of ongoing violations. It called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of political, associative, and religious rights. The statement highlighted the heavy losses humanity has endured in world wars, and the understanding that progress relies on honoring human rights. It deemed the Durban conference a turning point in the global campaign for human rights. Regrettably, the IHRC noted the ongoing injustice against Palestinians and human rights abuses against activists, journalists, minorities, children, and women in certain regions. While the September 11 attacks united nations against terrorism, some countries' reliance on military power and disregard for civilian human rights threaten peace and security. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings on human rights respect, emphasizing that true peace is contingent upon honoring human rights. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson also called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and to allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings. END OF SUMMARY.
