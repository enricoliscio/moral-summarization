SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about a return to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC noted the many documents and efforts made by the international community to promote and protect human rights, yet regretted that the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have not been fully realized. The IHRC highlighted the International Conference against Racism in Durban as a turning point in the global campaign for human rights. It condemned injustices against the Palestinians and violations of human rights against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women worldwide. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the promotion of political rights, women's rights, and the rights recommended by divine religions. It urged statesmen to respect human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot exist without them. Separately, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and to allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians.
