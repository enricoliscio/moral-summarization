SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on International Human Rights Day (December 10) that the world is reverting to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and agreements promoting human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been implemented. The commission called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The IHRC also condemned injustices against the Palestinian nation, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. Additionally, the Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, urged Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
