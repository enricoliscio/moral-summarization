SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expresses deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weaponry dominate international relations, jeopardizing hard-won human rights advancements. The statement, marking the International Day for Human Rights, laments the unfulfilled promises of the International Declaration for Human Rights, despite the formulation of numerous documents promoting human rights and cultural perspectives. The IHRC calls for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights of religious minorities, children, and associations. It highlights the Durban conference as a turning point in the global campaign for human rights, but deplores ongoing injustices against Palestinians and human rights abuses worldwide. The statement condemns the September 11 terrorist attacks and criticizes certain countries for responding with military force, trampling on the human rights of civilians. It urges statesmen to embrace religious teachings that respect human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot exist without honoring them. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson adds her voice, calling on Israel to halt bombings and targeted killings of Palestinians, and to permit international monitors. The IHRC and Robinson stand united in their commitment to uphold human rights, peace, and security, urging an end to violations and injustices.
