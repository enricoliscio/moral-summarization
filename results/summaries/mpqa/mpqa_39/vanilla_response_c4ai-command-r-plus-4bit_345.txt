SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. The IHRC issued a statement on December 9, emphasizing the importance of human rights and the numerous documents signed to promote them. They called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the violation of various human rights, including women's rights and religious minorities' rights. The statement lamented the unfulfilled promises of the international declaration of human rights and the losses humanity has suffered as a result. It highlighted the Durban conference as a turning point in the campaign for human rights and decried the injustice and violations faced by the Palestinian people, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women worldwide. The IHRC urged statesmen to follow religious teachings that advocate for human rights, emphasizing that peace is contingent on respecting human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect international law. She condemned Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians.
