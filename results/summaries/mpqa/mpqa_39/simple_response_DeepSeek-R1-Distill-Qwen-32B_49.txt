Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is from IRNA, Tehran, and it's about the Islamic Human Rights Commission expressing concerns on Human Rights Day. They're worried about a return to a time where force dominated international relations. They mention that after 50 years and heavy losses from wars, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. But despite all these efforts, human rights are still being violated.

The IHRC calls for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. They emphasize the importance of human rights as per divine religions and international declarations. They regret that these provisions haven't been realized, pointing out the suffering from world wars and the necessity of honoring human rights for progress.

They highlight the Durban conference as a turning point against racism but deplore injustices against Palestinians and others. They mention the September 11 attacks and the international solidarity against terrorism, but some countries still use military force, trampling human rights. They urge statesmen to follow religious teachings for peace.

Additionally, Mary Robinson from the UN calls on Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors, denouncing targeted killings.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral tone. I should include the IHRC's concerns, the call for human rights, the Durban conference, the situation with Palestine, the mention of September 11, and the UN's call. I need to keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

I'll start by stating the IHRC's concern about force in international relations. Then mention the efforts made but the violations still happening. Highlight their call for human rights, the Durban conference, the Palestinian issue, the September 11 attacks and the response, the criticism of military force, and the UN's call to Israel. End with the emphasis on human rights for peace.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure it's concise but covers all key points without losing the moral framing. Also, ensure it's clear and flows well.
