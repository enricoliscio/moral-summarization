SUMMARY: On the international day of human rights, the Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. The IHRC statement highlighted the numerous documents and efforts made by the international community to promote human rights and stop their violation, emphasizing the need to honor human rights declarations and recommendations of divine religions. Regrettably, the provisions of these declarations have not been fully realized, and the world has witnessed devastating wars and losses. The IHRC also condemned injustice, discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, particularly against the Palestinian nation and political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. It urged statesmen to respect religious teachings and work towards establishing peace by honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect human rights, denouncing targeted killings and terrorist attacks. The IHRC's statement is a reminder that the international community must remain vigilant in its campaign to uphold human rights and eradicate terrorism and injustice.
