SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on International Human Rights Day that the world is reverting to a period where "force and weapon have the last say" in international relations. Despite numerous documents and international efforts to promote human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions of the International Declaration for Human Rights have not been materialized. The statement condemned the "injustice" against the Palestinian nation, "violation" of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. It urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace can be established without honoring human rights. The IHRC also deplored the "trampling" upon human rights of civilians by certain countries resorting to military power. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop "bombing" Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli "terrorist attacks" against Palestinian activists.
