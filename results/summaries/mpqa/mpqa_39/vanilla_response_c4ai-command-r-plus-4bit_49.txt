SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC noted that numerous documents and declarations have been created to promote and protect human rights, yet provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are still not being met. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of political, associative, and women's rights. The statement also highlighted the injustice against Palestinians and human rights violations against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women globally. While the world united against the 9/11 terrorist attacks, certain countries continue to use military power and disregard civilian human rights. The IHRC urged world leaders to abide by religious teachings that respect human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot exist without them. Separately, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and to allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli targeted killings.
