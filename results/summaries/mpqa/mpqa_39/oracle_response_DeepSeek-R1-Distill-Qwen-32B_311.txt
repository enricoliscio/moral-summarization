Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing of the original article. They provided the text and the specific morally framed words they want included. First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about the IHRC expressing concern over the return of force in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. They mention the efforts to promote human rights through various documents but note that these haven't been fully realized. They also talk about the Durban conference and the situation with Israel and Palestine.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should make sure to incorporate words like "force," "honor," "losses," "discrimination," etc. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: IHRC's concern, the history of human rights efforts, the Durban conference, the call to stop violations, the situation in Palestine, and the UN's call to Israel.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the concern, then the historical context, the specific issues like discrimination and torture, the Durban conference, the call for peace, and the current actions by Israel. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate without making it sound forced.

Let me draft this step by step. First, mention the IHRC's concern about force and weapons. Then, talk about the efforts to honor human rights after losses. Include the documents signed and the promotion of rights. Highlight the violations still happening, like discrimination and torture. Mention the Durban conference as a turning point. Then, discuss the call for peace and the problem of some countries using military force. Finally, address the UN's call to Israel to stop bombing and killing Palestinians.

I should check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Also, make sure all the key moral words are included without making the summary too cluttered. I need to balance conciseness with the inclusion of necessary terms. Maybe I can combine some points to save space while still conveying the message.

Let me put it all together, ensuring each sentence flows into the next and that the moral framing is clear. I'll start with the IHRC's statement, move through the historical context, the ongoing issues, the conference, the call for action, and end with the UN's specific request to Israel. That should cover all the main points and include the required moral terms effectively.

SUMMARY: The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. The IHRC highlighted the international community's efforts to formulate documents to honor human rights after decades of losses and suffering, including the signing of hundreds of agreements to promote rights and stop violations. However, the organization regretted that the provisions of the International Declaration of Human Rights remain unmaterialized, citing ongoing discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC emphasized the need to honor human rights, including political, women's, and minority rights, as advocated by divine religions. It deplored injustice against Palestinians and violations of human rights worldwide, urging statesmen to respect religious teachings on human rights. The IHRC also criticized the use of military power by some countries, which tramples on civilians' rights. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson called on Israel to halt bombing and targeted killings in Palestine, emphasizing the need to promote peace and security globally. END OF SUMMARY.
