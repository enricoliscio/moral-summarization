SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on the International Day for Human Rights that the world is reverting to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and agreements promoting human rights, violations persist, including discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC called for the prohibition of these practices and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The statement lamented that the provisions of the International Declaration for Human Rights have not been fully implemented. It also condemned injustices against the Palestinian nation, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings that call for respect for human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinians.
