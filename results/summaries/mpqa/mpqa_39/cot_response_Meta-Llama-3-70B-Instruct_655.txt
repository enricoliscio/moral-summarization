SUMMARY:
The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of force and weapon dominance in international relations. The IHRC regretted that despite numerous documents and agreements, human rights are still being violated, and provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized. The commission condemned injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
