SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) has expressed concern about the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, undermining human rights. On the occasion of International Human Rights Day, the IHRC called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The commission lamented that despite numerous international documents and agreements, human rights provisions have not been fully implemented. The IHRC also condemned injustices against the Palestinian nation, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. Additionally, the commission urged statesmen to respect human rights, citing religious teachings, and warned that peace cannot be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
