Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is from Tehran and talks about the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressing concerns about the return of force in international relations. They're marking Human Rights Day, December 10. They mention that after 50 years of experience and losses, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. But despite all these efforts, the provisions haven't been materialized, leading to continued violations.

They also talk about the Durban conference against racism as a turning point. The IHRC condemns the injustice against Palestinians and violations of human rights in other parts of the world. They mention the September 11 attacks and the solidarity against terrorism, but some countries are still using military power, trampling on human rights.

Mary Robinson from the UN calls on Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors. She condemns targeted killings of Palestinians.

Now, I need to make sure I include as many of the morally framed words as possible: honor, losses, suffered, put, stop, violation, prohibition, discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, honoring, materialized, racism, campaign, injustice, condemned, attacks, terrorism, peace, security, resort, embark, trampling, respect, bombing, targeted, killing.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the IHRC's concern about the return of force, mention Human Rights Day, the efforts made, and the unmet goals. Then, I'll touch on the Durban conference, the injustices, the September 11 attacks and the subsequent issues, and finally Robinson's call to action. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure to include the moral terms and maintain the flow.

The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. Despite efforts to honor human rights through numerous documents, violations persist, including discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC highlighted the Durban conference against racism as a turning point but deplored ongoing injustices against Palestinians and others. Condemning terrorism, the IHRC noted that some nations resort to military power, trampling human rights. UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson called for Israel to stop bombing and targeted killings in Palestine, emphasizing the need for peace and security through respect for human rights. The IHRC stressed that peace cannot be achieved without honoring these principles. END OF SUMMARY.
