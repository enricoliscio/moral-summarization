SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the resurgence of force and weapon in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and international efforts to promote and honor human rights, violations persist. The IHRC called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and urged states to honor human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The statement regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, leading to heavy human losses. The IHRC condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The commission urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, warning that no peace can be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
