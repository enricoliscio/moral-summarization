Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article is from Tehran and talks about the Islamic Human Rights Commission expressing concern over the return of force in international relations. They mention the International Day for Human Rights and the efforts to honor human rights after 50 years of losses. They've signed many documents and different cultures have their outlooks on human rights. The IHRC calls for prohibiting discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and honoring various rights. They regret that the declaration hasn't been materialized. They mention the Durban conference as a turning point and deplore injustice against Palestinians and others. They condemn the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent use of military power. Mary Robinson from the UN calls for Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the morally framed words. I should start by highlighting the IHRC's concern about force in international relations. Mention the International Day for Human Rights and the efforts to honor human rights despite losses. Include the call for prohibition of discrimination, torture, etc., and the regret that the declaration hasn't been materialized. Mention the Durban conference as a campaign against racism. Deplore the injustice against Palestinians and others. Condemn 9/11 attacks and the use of military power leading to trampling of human rights. Finally, mention Robinson's call for Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors, emphasizing peace and security.

I should make sure to include words like honor, losses, prohibition, violation, discrimination, torture, detention, materialized, campaign, injustice, condemned, attacks, terrorism, peace, security, trampling, respect, bombing, targeted, killing. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the IHRC's statement, their calls, the Durban conference, the situation with Palestine, and Robinson's call.

Let me draft it:

The IHRC expressed concern about the resurgence of force in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite efforts to honor human rights after heavy losses, the IHRC regrets that the declaration's provisions haven't been materialized. They call for prohibiting discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, emphasizing the need to honor human rights as per divine religions. The Durban conference was a campaign against racism, but injustice persists against Palestinians and others. The IHRC condemns the 9/11 attacks but criticizes the resort to military power, which tramples human rights. Robinson urges Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors, highlighting the need for peace and security.

I think this covers the main points and uses the required moral words. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. It seems concise enough.
