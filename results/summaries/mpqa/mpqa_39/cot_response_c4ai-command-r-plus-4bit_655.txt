SUMMARY:
The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a time when force and weapons dominated international relations. The statement, marking the "international day for human rights," highlighted the numerous documents formulated by the international community to uphold human rights, following bitter experiences and devastating losses. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights recommended by divine religions. Despite the progress made, the IHRC regretted that the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have not been fully realized, with ongoing injustices against Palestinians and violations against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The statement condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks and called for solidarity to root out terrorism and promote peace and security. It deplored the actions of certain countries that resort to military power and trample on the human rights of civilians. The IHRC urged statesmen to respect human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without honoring them. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect the human rights of Palestinians, denouncing their targeted killing.
