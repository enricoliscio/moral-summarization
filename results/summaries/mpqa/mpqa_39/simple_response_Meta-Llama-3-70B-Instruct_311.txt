SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on International Human Rights Day that the world is reverting to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and international agreements, human rights violations persist. The IHRC called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The statement lamented that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been realized. It also condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation, violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The IHRC urged statesmen to respect human rights, citing religious teachings, and warned that peace cannot be established without honoring human rights.
