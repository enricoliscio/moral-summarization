SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations, marking a troubling shift away from the respect for human rights. In a statement, the IHRC highlighted the numerous documents and efforts of the international community to promote and uphold human rights, yet lamented that the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remain unfulfilled. The statement called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of various rights, including political, associational, and women's rights. It also drew attention to the injustice faced by the Palestinian people and the human rights abuses endured by activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain parts of the world. The IHRC urged world leaders to heed religious teachings that advocate for human rights, emphasizing that true peace can only be achieved by honoring those rights. The statement concluded by calling on Israel to cease its military attacks on Palestinian targets and to respect the human rights of civilians, a plea that aligns with the fundamental principles of humanity and justice.
