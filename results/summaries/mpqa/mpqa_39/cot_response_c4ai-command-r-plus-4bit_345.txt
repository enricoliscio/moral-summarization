SUMMARY:
The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the return to an era where force and weapons dominate international relations. The statement, marking the "international day for human rights," highlights the numerous documents formulated by the international community to uphold human rights, yet regrets that provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remain unfulfilled. The IHRC calls for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of political, associative, and women's rights. It laments the devastating losses humanity has endured and the ongoing injustice against the Palestinian nation and human rights activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women worldwide. The statement condemns the September 11 terrorist attacks and emphasizes that true solidarity and peace can only be achieved by respecting human rights, not through military power and trampling on civilians' rights. Statesmen are urged to heed religious teachings that advocate for respect and peace, which cannot be attained without honoring human rights. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, joins the call, urging Israel to halt its terrorist attacks and targeted killing of Palestinians and allow international monitors into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
