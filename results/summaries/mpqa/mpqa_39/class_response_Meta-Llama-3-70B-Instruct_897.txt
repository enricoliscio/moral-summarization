SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on International Human Rights Day that the world is reverting to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and international agreements, human rights violations persist, including discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and racism. The IHRC urged for the prohibition of such violations and honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The statement regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized. It condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The IHRC called on statesmen to heed religious teachings that respect human rights, emphasizing that no peace can be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, denounced Israel's terrorist attacks against Palestinians and urged it to halt targeted killings.
