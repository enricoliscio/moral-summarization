SUMMARY:
The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to an era where force and weapons dictate international relations. The statement, marking the "international day for human rights," highlights the numerous documents formulated by the international community to promote human rights and stop their violation. The IHRC calls for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and a commitment to honoring human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights recommended by divine religions. It regrets that the provisions of the international declaration of human rights have not been fully realized, despite the devastating losses suffered by humanity in world wars. The statement also deplores the injustice against the Palestinian nation and human rights violations against political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in some parts of the world. It condemns the September 11 terrorist attacks and emphasizes that solidarity and respect for human rights are key to establishing peace, not military power. The IHRC urges statesmen to heed religious teachings that advocate for human rights respect. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and respect the human rights of civilians. END OF SUMMARY.
