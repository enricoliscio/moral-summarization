SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about a return to an era where force and weapons dictate international relations. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC lamented that despite numerous documents and agreements promoting human rights, violations persist, including discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC called for adherence to human rights principles, including political rights, women's rights, and religious freedoms. The statement highlighted the international conference against racism in Durban as a turning point in the global campaign for human rights. It condemned injustices against Palestinians and violations against activists, journalists, minorities, children, and women worldwide. The IHRC noted that while the September 11 attacks united nations against terrorism, certain countries' reliance on military power threatens civilians' human rights. It urged statesmen to respect religious teachings on human rights, emphasizing that peace is contingent on upholding human rights. Separately, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings.
