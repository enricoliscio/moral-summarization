SUMMARY:
The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressed concern about the return to a time when force and weapons dominated international relations. The statement, marking the "international day for human rights," highlighted the numerous documents formulated by the international community to uphold human rights, following bitter experiences and devastating losses. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights of religious minorities, children, and journalists. It regretted that the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have not been fully realized, despite the global condemnation of the terrorist attacks on September 11 and the potential for solidarity to bring about peace and security. Unfortunately, some countries continue to resort to military power and trample on the human rights of civilians. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings that call for respect for human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot be established without honoring them. The statement also decried the injustice against Palestinians and violations of human rights against political activists, journalists, and religious minorities in some parts of the world. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and to halt targeted killings of Palestinians, denouncing these acts as terrorist attacks.
