SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC lamented the lack of progress in honoring human rights despite numerous documents and agreements formulated by the international community. The statement highlighted the importance of human rights in ensuring progress and peace, and called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, including political and religious freedoms, women's rights, and children's rights. The IHRC also regretted the ongoing injustice against the Palestinian people and violations of human rights of activists, journalists, minorities, and women in certain parts of the world. It urged statesmen to abide by religious teachings that call for respect for human rights and emphasized that peace cannot be achieved without upholding human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease bombing Palestinian targets and to allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians.
