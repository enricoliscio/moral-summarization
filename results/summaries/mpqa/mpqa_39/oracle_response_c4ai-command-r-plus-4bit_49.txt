SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations, marking the "international day for human rights." The statement highlighted the numerous documents formulated to honor human rights after devastating world wars, yet lamented that provisions of the international declaration remain unmaterialized. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights of religious minorities, children, and journalists. It regretted the injustice against the Palestinian nation and condemned terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, urging statesmen to respect human rights teachings for establishing peace. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson denounced Israeli terrorist attacks and called for a halt to the bombing of Palestinian targets and the killing of Palestinians. The statement concluded by urging respect for human rights to achieve peace and security, instead of resorting to military power and trampling on civilian's rights. END OF SUMMARY.
