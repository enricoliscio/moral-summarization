SUMMARY: On the international day of human rights, the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the resurgence of a period where force and weapons dictate international relations. In a statement, the IHRC lamented the gap between the numerous documents formulated to honor human rights and the reality of ongoing violations. They called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the honoring of various human rights, including women's rights and political rights. The statement also highlighted the injustice faced by the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain parts of the world. It urged statesmen to abide by religious teachings that advocate for respect and peace, emphasizing that true peace cannot exist without the honoring of human rights. Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, denounced Israeli terrorist attacks and called for a halt to the targeted killing of Palestinians, urging Israel to allow international monitors into the region. The IHRC's statement is a stark reminder that despite efforts to promote human rights, violations and injustices persist, and the international community must remain vigilant in upholding the principles intended to honor and protect human dignity.
