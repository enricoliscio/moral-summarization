SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the return to a time when force and weaponry dictated international relations. In a statement commemorating Human Rights Day, the IHRC lamented the gap between the numerous human rights documents formulated by the international community and the reality of ongoing human rights violations. The statement called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and other human rights abuses, emphasizing the importance of respecting political rights, freedom of association, women's rights, and the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While recognizing the progress made at the World Conference against Racism, the IHRC deplored the ongoing injustice against Palestinians and human rights violations against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain regions. The IHRC urged world leaders to heed religious teachings on human rights, emphasizing that true peace cannot exist without respecting human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to cease its military attacks on Palestinian targets and respect international human rights laws. She condemned Israel's targeted killing of Palestinians and urged an end to terrorism and a focus on establishing peace and security. END OF SUMMARY.
