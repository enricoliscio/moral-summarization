Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressing concerns about the return of force in international relations. They're marking the International Day for Human Rights on December 10.

They mention that after 50 years of experience and heavy losses, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. But despite all these efforts, human rights are still being violated. They call for an end to discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. They also highlight the importance of political rights, women's rights, and rights from the international declaration.

The IHRC regrets that the provisions of the international declaration haven't been realized. They point out the heavy losses from world wars and the dependence of progress on human rights. They also mention the Durban conference against racism as a turning point.

They deplore the injustice against Palestinians and human rights violations against activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. They note that all nations condemned the 9/11 attacks but some countries are still using military power, trampling human rights.

Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner, calls on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors. She condemns targeted killings.

So, the summary should include the main points: IHRC's concerns, the call for human rights, the Durban conference, the situation in Palestine, and Robinson's statements.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed.
