SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the return to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC lamented the gap between the numerous human rights documents signed and the reality of ongoing human rights violations worldwide. They urged an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the violation of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and the rights of religious minorities. The statement highlighted the heavy losses humanity has suffered in wars and emphasized that progress depends on honoring human rights. It condemned injustices against the Palestinian people and violations against activists, journalists, minorities, children, and women. While the world united in condemning the 9/11 terrorist attacks, certain countries continue to resort to military power, trampling on the human rights of civilians. The IHRC called on statesmen to respect religious teachings on human rights and work towards establishing peace by honoring human rights. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson denounced Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings of Palestinians, urging an end to the bombing of Palestinian targets and calling for international monitors.
