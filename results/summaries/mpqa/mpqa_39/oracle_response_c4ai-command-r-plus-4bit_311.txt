SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the return to a time when force and weapons were the ultimate arbiters in international relations. In a statement marking the "international day for human rights," the IHRC lamented that despite the formulation of numerous documents and the signing of several hundred agreements to promote and honor human rights, the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been fully materialized. The statement regretted the heavy human losses suffered during devastating world wars and ongoing violations of human rights, particularly the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the targeting of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women in certain parts of the world. It urged world statesmen to heed religious teachings that call for respect and honor for human rights, emphasizing that true peace cannot be achieved without upholding these values. The IHRC called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and violations of human rights, including political rights, association rights, women's rights, and the rights recommended by divine religions. The statement also denounced the use of military power and the trampling of civilian human rights, emphasizing that a united stand against terrorism should lead to the expansion of peace and security, not further suffering. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, echoed these sentiments, calling on Israel to cease its terrorist attacks and bombing of Palestinian targets while urging a halt to the targeted killing of Palestinians and the admission of international monitors.
