Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is from IRNA, Tehran, and it's about the Islamic Human Rights Commission expressing concerns on Human Rights Day. They mention the reliance on force and weapons in international relations, which is a moral concern. They talk about the many documents and efforts to promote human rights but note that these haven't been materialized yet.

They list several moral issues like discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and emphasize the need to honor human rights. The IHRC also mentions the Durban conference as a turning point and condemns injustice against Palestinians and violations against journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. They note the global condemnation of 9/11 but criticize countries using military force, which tramples human rights. They urge respecting religious teachings for peace and security.

Mary Robinson from the UN calls for Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors, denouncing targeted killings.

Now, I need to create a summary using as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I'll start by mentioning the IHRC's concern about force and weapons. Then, note the efforts to formulate and honor human rights but the lack of materialization. Highlight the call for prohibition of discrimination, torture, etc. Mention the Durban conference as a turning point. Condemn the injustice against Palestinians and others. Note the global solidarity after 9/11 but criticism of military actions. Urge respecting human rights for peace. Finally, mention Robinson's call to Israel to stop bombing and killings.

I need to make sure to include words like formulated, honor, losses, signed, promote, stop, violation, prohibition, discrimination, torture, detention, materialized, injustice, attacks, terrorism, peace, security, resort, trampling, bombing, terrorist, halt, killing.

Let me structure this concisely, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. Despite numerous efforts to formulate and honor human rights through documents and cultural outlooks, the IHRC regrets that these goals remain unmaterialized. It calls for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, including those of women and political activists. The IHRC condemns injustice against the Palestinian nation and violations of human rights in various regions. While the global community condemned the September 11 attacks, some nations resort to military power, trampling human rights. The IHRC urges respect for religious teachings to achieve peace and security. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson called on Israel to halt bombing in the West Bank and Gaza, denouncing targeted killings of Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
