SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on International Human Rights Day that the world is reverting to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and international agreements promoting human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have not been implemented. The commission condemned injustices against the Palestinian nation, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. It also criticized certain countries for resorting to military power and violating human rights. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that peace cannot be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
