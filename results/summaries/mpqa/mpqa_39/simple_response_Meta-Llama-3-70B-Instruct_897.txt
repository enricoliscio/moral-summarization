SUMMARY:

The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran has expressed concern about the resurgence of force and violence in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and agreements, human rights continue to be violated, including discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention. The IHRC calls for the prohibition of these violations and the honoring of human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and the rights of associations. The statement regrets that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, and that human communities have suffered heavy losses due to the neglect of human rights. The IHRC also deplores the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The statement urges statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace can be established without honoring human rights.
