SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on the International Day for Human Rights that the world is reverting to a period where "force and weapon have the last say" in international relations. Despite numerous documents and international agreements to promote human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions have not been materialized, leading to heavy human losses. The commission called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and honoring human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The IHRC deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The statement urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
