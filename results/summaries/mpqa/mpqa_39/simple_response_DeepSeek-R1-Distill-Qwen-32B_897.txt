Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressing concerns about the return of force in international relations. They're marking the International Day for Human Rights. They mention that after 50 years of experience and losses, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. However, despite these efforts, human rights violations are still happening, especially in conflicts like the Palestinian issue. They also talk about the Durban conference against racism as a turning point and criticize some countries for using military power, which leads to human rights abuses. The UN High Commissioner, Mary Robinson, is urging Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors.

So, the moral framing here is about the importance of human rights and the failure to implement them despite efforts. The IHRC is emphasizing the need to respect human rights through peaceful means rather than force. They also highlight the hypocrisy of some nations using military action while claiming to support human rights.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: IHRC's concern, the history of human rights efforts, the Durban conference, the criticism of military force, the specific issues like Palestinian rights, and the UN's call to action. Also, the moral angle is clearâ€”human rights are essential, and their neglect leads to conflict and suffering.

I should structure the summary to first mention the IHRC's concern, then the historical context, the Durban conference, the call for human rights, the criticism of military actions, and the UN's involvement. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while capturing all these elements.

Let me draft the summary:

The IHRC expressed concern over the resurgence of force in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite numerous efforts and documents, human rights violations persist, particularly in conflicts like Palestine. The Durban conference was a significant step, but some countries continue to use military force, undermining human rights. The UN called for Israel to stop attacks and allow monitors. The IHRC emphasizes the importance of respecting human rights for peace and security, urging adherence to religious and international principles.

Wait, that's a bit too brief. Maybe add a bit more detail about the human rights issues and the moral stance.

Revised:

The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran expressed concern over the resurgence of force in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite numerous efforts to promote human rights through various documents and the Durban conference against racism, violations persist, especially in conflicts like Palestine. The IHRC criticized the use of military power, which tramples human rights, and urged nations to respect human rights as per religious and international principles. The UN High Commissioner called for Israel to cease attacks and allow monitors, highlighting the moral imperative to uphold human dignity and peace.

That's better, but maybe a bit too concise. Let me check the word count. It should be under 200 words.

Another version:

The IHRC emphasized the importance of human rights, noting the failure to implement them despite decades of efforts. They highlighted the Durban conference as a turning point but criticized military actions that violate rights. The UN urged Israel to stop attacks, underscoring the moral need for peace and justice.

Hmm, that's too short. I think the initial version I had was better but needs to include all key points without being too wordy.

Final attempt:

The IHRC expressed concern over the return of force in international relations, marking the International Day for Human Rights. Despite efforts to promote human rights through numerous documents and the Durban conference, violations persist, particularly in conflicts like Palestine. The IHRC criticized the use of military power, which undermines human rights, and urged nations to adhere to religious and international principles. The UN High Commissioner called for Israel to cease attacks and allow monitors, highlighting the moral imperative to uphold human dignity and peace.

That should cover all points concisely.
