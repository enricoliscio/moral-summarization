Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The IHRC is expressing concern about the return of force and weapons in international relations. They're marking Human Rights Day and discussing the international community's efforts to promote human rights through various documents. However, these efforts haven't materialized, leading to losses and suffering.

I should highlight the key moral issues: discrimination, torture, detention, and the need for prohibition. Also, the IHRC mentions the Durban conference as a turning point, which is important. They deplore injustice against Palestinians and violations in other parts of the world. The statement also addresses terrorism and the call for respecting human rights as per religious teachings.

Mary Robinson's call for Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors adds another layer. I need to include terms like 'bombing' and 'terrorist attacks' as they are part of the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure to use the specified moral words. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from the IHRC's concerns to the call for action.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring all key moral points are covered without losing the essence of the article. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern over the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking Human Rights Day. Despite numerous documents and efforts to honor human rights, the IHRC regrets that these principles remain unmaterialized, resulting in heavy losses and suffering. The organization calls for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, emphasizing the need to honor human rights, including political and women's rights. The IHRC highlights the Durban conference as a turning point in promoting human rights but deplores ongoing injustices, such as violations against Palestinians, political activists, journalists, and minorities. It condemns terrorism while urging states to respect religious teachings on human rights, stressing that peace cannot be achieved without honoring them. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings of Palestinians. The IHRC warns against resorting to military power, which tramples human rights, and urges a commitment to peace and security. END OF SUMMARY.
