SUMMARY:
The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of a period where force and weapon have the last say in international relations. The IHRC urged for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The statement regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, leading to heavy human losses and suffering. The IHRC deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. The commission called for respect for human rights, condemning terrorism and trampling upon human rights. The IHRC emphasized that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow in international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
