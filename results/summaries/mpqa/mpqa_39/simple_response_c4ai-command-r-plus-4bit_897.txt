SUMMARY: The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed deep concern about the world returning to a time when force and weapons dictated international relations, undermining hard-won progress in human rights. In a statement marking Human Rights Day, the IHRC lamented that despite numerous documents and agreements promoting human rights, violations persist. They called for an end to discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and the protection of political, associative, and women's rights, as well as rights recommended by divine religions. The IHRC regretted the injustice against Palestinians and human rights abuses against activists, journalists, minorities, children, and women globally. While the September 11 attacks united nations against terrorism, certain countries' reliance on military power threatens civilians' human rights. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings on human rights, emphasizing that peace is contingent on their respect. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson also called on Israel to cease attacks on Palestinian targets and respect human rights, denouncing targeted killings. END OF SUMMARY.
