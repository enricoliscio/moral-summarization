Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The IHRC is concerned about the return of force in international relations and marks Human Rights Day by highlighting the importance of human rights documents. They mention the Durban conference as a turning point and criticize countries using military power, which tramples human rights. They also call out Israel for bombing and targeted killings. Mary Robinson from the UN urges Israel to stop these actions.

Now, I need to identify the key moral terms from the list: honor, losses, suffered, put, stop, violation, prohibition, discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, honoring, materialized, racism, campaign, injustice, condemned, attacks, terrorism, peace, security, resort, embark, trampling, respect, bombing, targeted, killing.

I should structure the summary to include these terms. Start by mentioning the IHRC's concern about force returning. Highlight the 50 years of experience leading to human rights documents. Emphasize the unfulfilled promises and the need to stop violations like discrimination and torture. Mention the Durban conference as a turning point against racism. Criticize countries using military power and trampling rights. Note the call for peace through respecting human rights, as per religious teachings. Include the UN's call for Israel to stop bombing and targeted killings.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include as many moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me draft this, ensuring the flow is logical and all important points are covered.

SUMMARY: The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the resurgence of force and weapons in international relations, marking December 10, the International Day for Human Rights. The IHRC highlighted the international community's efforts to honor human rights through numerous documents and measures, but regretted that these promises have not materialized. It called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, emphasizing the need to honor human rights, including political, women's, and children's rights. The IHRC deplored injustices against the Palestinian nation and violations of human rights in various regions, while also condemning the September 11 terrorist attacks. It urged statesmen to respect religious teachings on human rights, stating that peace cannot be achieved without honoring them. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing targeted killings of Palestinians. The IHRC stressed that resorting to military power tramples human rights, urging a return to peace and security through respect for human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
