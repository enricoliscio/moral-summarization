SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern on the International Day for Human Rights that the world is returning to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. Despite numerous documents and agreements promoting human rights, the IHRC lamented that provisions of the International Declaration for Human Rights have not been implemented. The commission called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The IHRC also condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, urged Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinians.
