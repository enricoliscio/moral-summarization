Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is from the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Tehran. They're marking Human Rights Day on December 10. They express concern that the world is returning to a time where force and weapons dominate international relations. They mention that after 50 years of bitter experiences and heavy losses, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights. However, the provisions of these documents haven't been materialized yet.

They talk about various human rights issues: discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention. They emphasize the importance of honoring human rights, including political rights, women's rights, and those outlined in the international declaration. They also mention the Durban conference against racism as a turning point.

The IHRC condemns the injustice against Palestinians and violations of human rights in other parts of the world, like against journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. They note that while the international community condemned the 9/11 attacks, some countries are still using military force, trampling on human rights.

Mary Robinson from the UN calls on Israel to stop bombing and allow monitors. She condemns targeted killings of Palestinians.

I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like honor, losses, suffered, put, stop, violation, prohibition, discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, honoring, materialized, racism, campaign, injustice, condemned, attacks, terrorism, peace, security, resort, embark, trampling, respect, bombing, targeted, killing.

I should structure the summary to cover the IHRC's concerns, the state of human rights documents, the issues they highlight, the Durban conference, the 9/11 context, and the UN's call to Israel.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include these moral terms and keep it under 200 words.
