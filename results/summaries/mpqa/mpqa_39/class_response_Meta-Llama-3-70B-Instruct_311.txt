SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of force and weapon dominance in international relations, undermining human rights. The IHRC urged the prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and honoring of human rights, political rights, women's rights, and rights outlined in the international declaration for human rights. The statement regretted that these provisions have not been materialized, leading to heavy human losses and suffering. The IHRC condemned the injustice against the Palestinian nation, violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. The commission emphasized that peace and security can only be established by honoring human rights, and not through military power and trampling upon civilians' rights. The IHRC's call was echoed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who urged Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors.
