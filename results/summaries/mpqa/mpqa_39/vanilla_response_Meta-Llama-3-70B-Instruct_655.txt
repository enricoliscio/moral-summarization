SUMMARY:

The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) has expressed concern over the return to a period where force and weapons dominate international relations. On the occasion of International Human Rights Day, the IHRC called for the prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and the honoring of human rights, political rights, and women's rights. The commission regretted that the provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized, despite numerous documents and conferences aimed at promoting human rights. The IHRC also deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and the violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, and religious minorities. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, urged Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks against Palestinian activists.
