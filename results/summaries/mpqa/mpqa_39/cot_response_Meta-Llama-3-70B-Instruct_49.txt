SUMMARY:
The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of force and weapon dominance in international relations, undermining human rights. Despite numerous documents and international agreements, the IHRC regretted that human rights provisions have not been materialized. The statement highlighted the devastating effects of wars and the importance of honoring human rights. It deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation, violation of human rights, and terrorism. The IHRC urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace can be established without honoring human rights. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, called on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors, denouncing Israeli terrorist attacks and targeted killings.
