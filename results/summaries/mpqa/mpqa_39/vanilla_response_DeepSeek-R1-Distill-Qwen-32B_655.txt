Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the Islamic Human Rights Commission in Tehran expressing concerns about the return of force in international relations. They're marking the International Day for Human Rights. 

They mention that over 50 years, the international community has created many documents to honor human rights, but these haven't been fully implemented. They list issues like discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention, and call for honoring various human rights. They also talk about the Durban conference against racism as a turning point.

The IHRC regrets that human rights are still being violated, especially against Palestinians, political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. They also note the September 11 attacks and the call for unity against terrorism, but criticize some countries for using military force and violating human rights.

Mary Robinson from the UN calls on Israel to stop bombing Palestinian targets and allow international monitors. She condemns targeted killings.

So, the summary should include the main points: IHRC's concerns about force in international relations, the lack of implementation of human rights documents, the Durban conference, violations against specific groups, the September 11 attacks and subsequent issues, and the UN's call to Israel.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the IHRC's statement, then the issues they highlight, and ending with the UN's call.
