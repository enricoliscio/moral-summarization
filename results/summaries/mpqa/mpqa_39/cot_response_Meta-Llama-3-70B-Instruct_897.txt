SUMMARY:
The Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) expressed concern about the return of a period where force and weapon have the last say in international relations. Despite numerous documents and international efforts to promote human rights, the IHRC regretted that provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized. The statement deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, religious minorities, children, and women. It urged statesmen to heed religious teachings calling for respect for human rights, emphasizing that no peace will be established without honoring human rights. The IHRC called for prohibition of discrimination, torture, and arbitrary detention, and honoring political rights, women's rights, and rights of associations. END OF SUMMARY.
