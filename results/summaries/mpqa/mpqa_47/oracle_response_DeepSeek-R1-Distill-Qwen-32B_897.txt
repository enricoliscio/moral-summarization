Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights. They call the report "odious" and express surprise. The report accuses Russia of poor media freedom and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia, led by Putin, frames the Chechen conflict as a war against terrorism, which the U.S. partially supports but also criticizes for abuses. The Ministry argues that the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues before criticizing Russia.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: closed, battle, terrorism, respect, violations, killings, abuse, sharing, opening, reanimate, turn, failure. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate.

I'll start by noting the Ministry's criticism of the report, using "odious." Then mention the surprise and the specific section on Chechnya. I should include the idea that the report seems outdated, referencing the international community closing ranks against terrorism. 

Next, I'll summarize the U.S. report's accusations about Chechnya, using "violations," "killings," and "abuse." Then explain Russia's stance on the conflict as a battle against terrorism, with some U.S. support but toned-down criticism due to anti-terrorism cooperation. 

The Ministry accuses the U.S. of reanimating the Chechen issue to irritate the partnership. Finally, they suggest the U.S. should address its own failures, like human rights agreements and the death penalty, while Russia has a moratorium.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure all the moral terms are included. Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and includes the necessary vocabulary.

SUMMARY:  
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and expressing surprise at its outdated framing. The report accused Russia of poor media freedom and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse by security forces. Russia portrays the Chechen conflict as a battle against terrorism, a view partially endorsed by the U.S., though criticism of Russian abuses was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terrorism coalition. The Ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of reanimating the Chechen issue to irritate the U.S.-Russian partnership. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights failures, such as failing to ratify international agreements and using the death penalty, before judging others. Russia, meanwhile, has a moratorium on capital punishment.  
END OF SUMMARY.
