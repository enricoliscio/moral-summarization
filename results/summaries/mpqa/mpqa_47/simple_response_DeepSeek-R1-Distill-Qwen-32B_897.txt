Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the article. It's about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights. The report criticized Russia, especially regarding Chechnya. The Ministry called the report "odious" and accused the U.S. of using outdated drafts, ignoring recent events like 9/11 and the anti-terrorism coalition.

Next, I should identify the key points. The Ministry is upset because the report doesn't align with the current partnership against terrorism. They also point out that the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like the death penalty and unratified treaties.

Now, the user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing. That means I need to highlight the criticism from both sides and the underlying moral arguments each is making. The Ministry is not just dismissing the report; they're questioning the U.S.'s credibility by pointing out their own issues.

I should structure the summary to include the main criticisms, the Ministry's arguments, and the moral counterpoints. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me start drafting: The Ministry criticizes the U.S. report as outdated and biased, especially on Chechnya. They argue that the U.S. should focus on their own issues, like the death penalty and human rights treaties. The report accuses Russia of human rights abuses, but the Ministry counters by emphasizing the partnership in fighting terrorism.

I think that covers the main points while maintaining the moral perspective. I should make sure it's clear that both sides are making moral arguments, with Russia pointing out the U.S.'s shortcomings to undermine their criticism.

SUMMARY:  
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and "outdated." The report accused Russia of poor human rights practices, particularly in Chechnya, where Russian forces were alleged to have committed serious violations, including extrajudicial killings. The Ministry argued that the report ignored recent global events, such as the 9/11 attacks and the international fight against terrorism, in which Russia played a key role. It accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of using the Chechnya issue to undermine the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism. The Ministry also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights shortcomings, such as the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements, before criticizing others. Russia, it noted, had implemented a moratorium on capital punishment as part of its efforts to join the Council of Europe.  
END OF SUMMARY.
