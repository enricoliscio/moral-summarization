Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Ministry is criticizing the U.S. report on human rights, particularly the section on Chechnya. They call it "odious" and mention that the U.S. seems to be using old drafts, ignoring recent events like 9/11 and the fight against terrorism. The report accuses Russia of media repression and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia sees the conflict as a war against terrorists, and the U.S. partly agrees but also criticizes Russia's treatment of civilians. However, the U.S. toned down their criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. The Ministry accuses U.S. "certain circles" of trying to stir up the Chechen issue. They also point out that the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like the death penalty and not ratifying international agreements.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the Ministry's criticism of the U.S. report as "odious." I'll note the surprise and the mention of old drafts. Then, I'll include the accusations of media repression and human rights violations, specifically extrajudicial killings. Russia's view of the conflict as a battle against terrorism is important, as is the U.S.'s partial endorsement but criticism of civilian abuse. The toning down after Russia joined the coalition should be included. The Ministry's accusation of U.S. circles trying to reanimate the issue is key. Finally, I'll add the Ministry's point about the U.S. needing to address its own issues, like the death penalty and unratified agreements.

I need to make sure to use the morally framed words: closed, battle, terrorism, respect, violations, killings, abuse, sharing, opening, reanimate, turn, failure. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate these without making the summary awkward.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Ministry criticizes U.S. report as "odious," surprised by old drafts ignoring recent events and terrorism battle.
2. Accuses Russia of media repression and human rights violations, including killings.
3. Russia sees Chechnya as a battle against terrorism, U.S. partly agrees but criticizes abuse, toned down after coalition.
4. Ministry claims U.S. circles try to reanimate Chechen issue as irritant.
5. Suggests U.S. address its own failures, like death penalty and unratified agreements.

Putting it all together concisely, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary is under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
The Russian Foreign Ministry sharply criticized the U.S. State Department's human rights report, calling it "odious" and "surprising," particularly its section on Chechnya. The ministry accused the report of using outdated drafts, ignoring recent global events like the 9/11 attacks and the international battle against terrorism. The report alleged Russia's media repression and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse of civilians. Russia portrays the Chechen conflict as a battle against terrorism, a view partially endorsed by the U.S., though U.S. criticism of Russia's actions was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. The ministry accused "certain U.S. circles" of trying to reanimate the Chechen issue as an irritant in U.S.-Russian relations. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights failures, such as the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements.  
END OF SUMMARY.
