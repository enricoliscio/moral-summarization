SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed dismay over the U.S. State Department's criticism of the country's human rights record, specifically regarding media independence and the situation in Chechnya. The Ministry questioned the report's fairness, suggesting it ignored Russia's efforts in the global fight against terrorism and the changed context post-9/11. While acknowledging ties between Chechen rebels and international terrorism, U.S. officials have also noted the absence of such ties among some rebels and criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian Ministry countered by alluding to the existence of "certain circles" in the U.S. opposed to the new partnership between the two countries and intent on exacerbating the "Chechen problem." The Ministry also highlighted the U.S.'s own human rights shortcomings, including the failure to ratify key agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. Russia, on the other hand, introduced a moratorium on capital punishment to join the Council of Europe. The exchange underscores the complex dynamics of the U.S.-Russian relationship, where cooperation in countering global terrorism coexists with ongoing disagreements over human rights and regional conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
