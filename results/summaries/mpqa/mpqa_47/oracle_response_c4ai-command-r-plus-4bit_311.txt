SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically its section on Chechnya, as being "odious" and out of touch with current efforts in the battle against international terrorism. The Ministry argued that the report ignored recent developments in both countries following the events of September 11, 2001, when the international community closed ranks in the fight against terrorism. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, the U.S. report criticized Russian security forces for human rights violations and extrajudicial killings. The Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin, has consistently portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against terrorism. The Foreign Ministry suggested that certain circles in the U.S. are attempting to reanimate the "Chechen problem" and turn it into an irritant in Russian-American relations. It also highlighted the United States' failure to ratify international human rights agreements and its use of the death penalty as areas that require attention before judging others. The Ministry's response reflects a defense of Russia's commitment to combating terrorism and its objection to what it perceives as unfair criticism of its human rights record. END OF SUMMARY.
