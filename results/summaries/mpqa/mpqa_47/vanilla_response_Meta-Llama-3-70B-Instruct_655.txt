SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and accusing the US of using outdated information. The report highlighted Russia's poor human rights record, particularly in Chechnya, where Russian security forces have been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The ministry claimed that the report reflected the efforts of certain US circles opposed to the new US-Russian partnership against international terrorism. Russia also suggested that the US should focus on its own human rights issues, such as its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others. The ministry's statement came in response to the report's criticism of Russia's media freedom and its handling of the conflict in Chechnya.
