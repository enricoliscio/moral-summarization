SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly its "odious" section on Chechnya. The Ministry expressed surprise and disappointment at the report, suggesting that its authors relied on outdated information and failed to acknowledge Russia's efforts in the international battle against terrorism post-9/11. While the U.S. has acknowledged the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, it has also criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians, although this criticism lessened after Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. The Ministry accused certain U.S. circles of attempting to undermine the new partnership by persistently highlighting the "Chechen problem." It also called on the U.S. to address its own human rights issues, including the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia demonstrated its commitment to human rights by introducing a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
