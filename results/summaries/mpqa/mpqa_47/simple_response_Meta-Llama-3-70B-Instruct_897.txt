SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly the section on Chechnya, calling it "odious". The ministry accuses the report's writers of using old drafts, ignoring recent events and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report highlights Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russian officials portray the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the US report notes that some rebels do not have international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The ministry suggests that the report reflects the efforts of certain US circles to undermine the new US-Russian partnership against terrorism and advises the US to investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty.
