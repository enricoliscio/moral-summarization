Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights. They called the report "odious," especially the part about Chechnya. The Ministry seems upset because they think the report is outdated, not considering recent events like 9/11 and the fight against terrorism. 

The U.S. report accuses Russia of having a poor human rights record, particularly in media freedom and Chechnya. It mentions that Russian security forces there have violated human rights, including extrajudicial killings. Russia, however, views Chechnya as a fight against international terrorists, and some U.S. officials agree, especially pointing out ties to al-Qaida. But the U.S. also criticizes Russia's treatment of civilians, though they toned down their criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition.

The Ministry argues that the report is influenced by groups in the U.S. who oppose the new partnership against terrorism. They suggest the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues before criticizing others, mentioning things like not ratifying international agreements and using the death penalty. Russia has a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Ministry's criticism of the report, highlighting the Chechnya section. Then mention the U.S. allegations and Russia's counterarguments, including their stance on terrorism and the Ministry's points about U.S. hypocrisy. I'll keep it concise, making sure all key points are covered without going into too much detail.
