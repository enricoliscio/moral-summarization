SUMMARY:
The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The report highlights Russia's "poor" record on media independence and freedom, and accuses Russian security forces in Chechnya of demonstrating "little respect" for basic human rights, with "credible" reports of "serious" violations. The ministry argues that the report reflects the efforts of "certain circles" in the U.S. that object to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism. The ministry also suggests that the U.S. should investigate its own human rights record, including its "failure" to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished. The ministry's response is seen as a pushback against U.S. criticism, with Russia portraying the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists. END OF SUMMARY.
