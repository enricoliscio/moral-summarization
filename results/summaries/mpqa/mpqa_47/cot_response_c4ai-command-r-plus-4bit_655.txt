SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly its "odious" section on Chechnya. The Ministry expressed dismay that the report seemed to ignore recent joint efforts in the international battle against terrorism, portraying Russia's actions in Chechnya as a disregard for basic human rights and extrajudicial killings. The U.S. report also noted Russia's poor record on media freedom and independence. In response, the Ministry accused the U.S. of being influenced by "certain circles" opposed to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism, and suggested that the U.S. first address its own human rights issues, such as the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia's introduction of a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 was a significant step towards joining the Council of Europe. The Ministry's statement reflects a strong defense of Russia's actions in Chechnya and a rejection of the U.S. criticism, emphasizing the country's commitment to fighting international terrorism and improving its human rights record.
