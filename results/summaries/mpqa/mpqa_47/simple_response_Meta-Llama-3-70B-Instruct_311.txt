SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and accusing the US of hypocrisy. The report highlights Russia's poor human rights record, particularly in Chechnya, where Russian security forces have been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The ministry argues that the report ignores the global fight against terrorism and the new US-Russian partnership, and instead reflects the efforts of "certain circles" in the US who object to this partnership. The ministry suggests that the US should focus on its own human rights issues, such as its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others. This response is morally framed as a defense of Russia's actions in Chechnya and a critique of US hypocrisy, highlighting the importance of cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
