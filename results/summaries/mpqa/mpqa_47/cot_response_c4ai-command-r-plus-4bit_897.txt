SUMMARY: Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record as "odious," expressing surprise and objection to the section on Chechnya. The Ministry argued that the report seemed to ignore recent events such as the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the international community's united front against terrorism. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, the U.S. report criticized Russia for its poor media independence and freedom, as well as its security forces' human rights abuses. Russian officials, including President Putin, have framed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorism, a view partially endorsed by the U.S. However, the U.S. also noted the absence of international ties among some rebels and toned down criticism of Russian military and police abuse of civilians after Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. The Foreign Ministry attributed the criticism on Chechnya to certain U.S. circles opposing the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism. It also called on the U.S. to address its own human rights issues, such as the failure to ratify international human rights agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
