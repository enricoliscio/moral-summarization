SUMMARY:
The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The report claims that Russian security forces in Chechnya have demonstrated little respect for basic human rights, with credible reports of serious violations, including extrajudicial killings. The ministry argues that the report reflects the efforts of "certain circles" in the U.S. that object to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism. Russia suggests that the U.S. should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify some international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others. The ministry's statement comes as a surprise, given the recent cooperation between the two countries in the battle against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
