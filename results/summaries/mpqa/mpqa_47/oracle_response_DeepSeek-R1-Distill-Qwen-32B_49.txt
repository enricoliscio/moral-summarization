Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights, specifically focusing on Chechnya. The ministry calls the report "odious" and accuses the U.S. of using outdated drafts, ignoring recent events like 9/11 and the international fight against terrorism. The U.S. report accuses Russia of media restrictions and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia, however, frames the Chechen conflict as a war against international terrorists, with some U.S. support but also criticism of Russian actions. The Russian ministry argues that the U.S. is trying to undermine the new partnership against terrorism and suggests the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like the death penalty.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: closed, battle, terrorism, respect, violations, killings, abuse, sharing, opening, reanimate, turn, failure. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the criticism from the Russian Foreign Ministry, mention the "odious" section on Chechnya, and their surprise. Then, I'll explain the U.S. report's accusations and Russia's counterarguments, including the terrorism framing. I'll also touch on the U.S. criticism of Russia's actions and the suggestion that the U.S. should address its own issues.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral terms are included. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral language.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and "surprising." The report accused Russia of media restrictions and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. The ministry argued that the report ignored recent global events, such as the fight against terrorism post-9/11, and accused the U.S. of using outdated drafts. Russia frames the Chechen conflict as a battle against international terrorists, with some U.S. support, though criticism of Russian actions was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. The ministry claimed the report reflects efforts by "certain circles" in the U.S. to reanimate the "Chechen problem" as an irritant in U.S.-Russian dialogue. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights issues, such as the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements. END OF SUMMARY.
