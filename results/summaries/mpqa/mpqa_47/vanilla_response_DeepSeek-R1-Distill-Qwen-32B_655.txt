Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights. They called the report "odious," especially regarding Chechnya. The report mentions Russia's poor media freedom and human rights issues in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia sees the conflict as a fight against terrorism, and the U.S. partially agrees but also criticizes some Russian actions. The Foreign Ministry accuses the U.S. of using old drafts and not considering recent events like 9/11. They also suggest the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like the death penalty and unratified treaties. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points: the criticism, Chechnya focus, U.S. stance, mutual accusations, and the call for the U.S. to address its issues.

I'll start by noting the main actors: Russian Foreign Ministry and U.S. State Department. The Ministry is upset about the report, especially the Chechnya section. The report accuses Russia of media issues and human rights violations. Russia sees it as a counter-terrorism effort, and the U.S. partly agrees but criticizes some actions. The Ministry claims the report uses outdated info and is part of efforts to harm the U.S.-Russia partnership. They also point out the U.S. should address its own issues like the death penalty and treaties. I'll structure this into a few sentences, making sure to cover all these points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and "outdated." The report accused Russia of poor media freedom and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia frames the Chechnya conflict as a counter-terrorism effort, a view partially endorsed by the U.S., though U.S. criticism of Russian actions was softened after Russia joined the anti-terrorism coalition. The Ministry accused the report of reflecting "certain circles" in the U.S. aiming to disrupt the U.S.-Russia partnership against terrorism. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights issues, such as the death penalty and unratified international agreements. END OF SUMMARY.
