SUMMARY: 
The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed its surprise and objection to the U.S. State Department's "odious" criticism of the country's human rights record, particularly regarding Chechnya. The Ministry argued that the report ignored recent events, including the international community's united front against terrorism post-9/11. 

The State Department's report highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as serious human rights violations by Russian security forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. While U.S. officials have endorsed the view that the conflict involves international terrorists, they have also criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians, though this criticism lessened after Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. 

Russia's Foreign Ministry accused certain U.S. circles of attempting to undermine the new partnership by reanimating the 'Chechen problem.' It also suggested that the U.S. address its own human rights issues, such as the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia, on the other hand, introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
