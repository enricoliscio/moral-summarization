SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, which highlighted concerns regarding media independence, freedom, and the situation in Chechnya. The Ministry expressed dismay at the report, suggesting it ignored recent developments in Russia's efforts against international terrorism and the changed context post-9/11. The U.S. report acknowledged the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya but also criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians, although with less intensity since Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. The Russian Ministry objected to the section on Chechnya, calling it "odious" and attributing it to "certain circles" in the U.S. who oppose the new partnership between the two countries. The Ministry also pointed out that the U.S. has its own human rights issues, such as the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a step towards joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
