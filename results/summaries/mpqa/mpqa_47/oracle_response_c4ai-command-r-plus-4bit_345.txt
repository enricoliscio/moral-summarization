SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically regarding Chechnya, as being "odious" and out of touch with current realities in the battle against international terrorism. The Ministry suggested that the report ignored the efforts made by Russia in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks to close ranks with the international community in the fight against terrorism. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, the U.S. report criticized Russian security forces for human rights violations and extrajudicial killings. The Foreign Ministry countered that certain circles in the U.S. were attempting to reanimate the "Chechen problem" and turn it into an irritant in Russian-American relations. The Ministry also drew attention to the United States' own human rights failures, including the failure to ratify international human rights agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. The Ministry's statement reflected Russia's objection to being judged on human rights while it is actively demonstrating respect for and sharing its intelligence in the global battle against terrorism.
