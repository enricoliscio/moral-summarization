SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly the "odious" section on Chechnya. The ministry claims the report is outdated and ignores the international community's united efforts against terrorism since 9/11. The report highlights Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse by both government and rebel forces. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict as a war against international terrorists, but the US report notes that some rebels lack international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The ministry accuses "certain circles" in the US of trying to undermine the US-Russian partnership against terrorism by reanimating the "Chechen problem". The ministry also suggests the US should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished.
