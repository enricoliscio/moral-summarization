SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically its section on Chechnya, calling it "odious." Russia expressed dismay that the report seemed to ignore recent joint efforts in the battle against international terrorism and the closing of ranks within the international community following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The U.S. report highlighted concerns about media independence and freedom in Russia, as well as serious human rights violations and extrajudicial killings by both government forces and Chechen fighters in Chechnya. While the U.S. has partially endorsed Russia's portrayal of the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, it has also noted that not all rebels have international ties and has criticized the abuse of civilians by Russian military and police forces. The Russian Foreign Ministry attributed the critical stance on Chechnya to "certain circles" in the U.S. who oppose the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism and seek to reanimate the "Chechen problem." Russia also pointed out the U.S.'s own human rights failures, including the failure to ratify international human rights agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a step toward joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
