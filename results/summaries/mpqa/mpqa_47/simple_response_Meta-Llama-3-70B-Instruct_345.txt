SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The ministry claims that the report is outdated and ignores the global fight against terrorism, as well as Russia's efforts in the anti-terrorist coalition. The report highlights Russia's poor human rights record, particularly in Chechnya, where security forces have been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The ministry suggests that the report is driven by "certain circles" in the US who object to the new US-Russian partnership against terrorism. In a tit-for-tat response, the ministry points out the US's own human rights shortcomings, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty. Russia, on the other hand, has introduced a moratorium on capital punishment.
