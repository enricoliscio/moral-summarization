SUMMARY: Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically its section on Chechnya, as "odious" and based on outdated information. The report, published on Monday, highlighted concerns about media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations by Russian security forces in Chechnya. The Russian government has framed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorism, a perspective partially endorsed by the U.S. while also acknowledging the lack of international ties among some rebels and criticizing abuses by Russian military and police. The Foreign Ministry attributed the critical report to "certain circles" in the U.S. opposed to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism, and suggested that the U.S. address its own human rights issues, including failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a step towards joining the Council of Europe.
END OF SUMMARY.
