SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The ministry claims the report is outdated and ignores the global fight against terrorism, which Russia has joined. The report accuses Russian security forces in Chechnya of human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings. Russia argues that the conflict in Chechnya is a war against international terrorists, while the US acknowledges this but also notes that some rebels have no international ties and criticizes Russian abuse of civilians. The ministry suggests that the report reflects the efforts of certain US circles opposed to the new US-Russian partnership against terrorism. Russia also points out the US's own human rights issues, such as its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished.
