SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically regarding Chechnya, as outdated and biased. The Ministry argued that the report ignored the new partnership between the U.S. and Russia in the fight against international terrorism and failed to acknowledge Russia's efforts in this regard, including sharing intelligence and allowing U.S. military deployment in Central Asia. Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have consistently portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, a view that has gained some support from U.S. officials. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, U.S. officials have also criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians, although their criticism has been muted since Russia joined the anti-terrorist coalition. The Foreign Ministry suggested that the U.S. should address its own human rights issues before judging others and that the State Department's report reflects the influence of certain circles in the U.S. who oppose the new partnership with Russia. Russia has taken steps towards improving human rights, such as introducing a moratorium on capital punishment, and expects the U.S. to recognize these efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
