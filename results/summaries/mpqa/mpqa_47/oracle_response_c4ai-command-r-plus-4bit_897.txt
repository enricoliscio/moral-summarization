SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed dismay over the U.S. State Department's criticism of the country's human rights record, specifically regarding Chechnya. The Ministry argued that the report ignored the international community's unified battle against terrorism in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The U.S. report highlighted concerns about media independence and freedoms in Russia, as well as serious human rights violations and extrajudicial killings by both government forces and Chechen fighters in Chechnya. While the U.S. acknowledges the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, it also notes that not all rebels have international ties and criticizes the abuse of civilians by Russian military and police forces. The Foreign Ministry attributed the criticism to certain circles in the U.S. attempting to reanimate the 'Chechen problem' and turn it into an irritant in Russian-American relations. The Ministry also pointed out the U.S.'s own human rights failures, including the failure to ratify international human rights agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a step towards joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
