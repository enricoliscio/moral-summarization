SUMMARY:
The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The report highlights Russia's "poor" record on media independence and freedom, as well as "serious" human rights violations in Chechnya, including "extrajudicial killings" by both government and Chechen fighters. The ministry claims the report's writers seem to have ignored recent events, including the 9/11 attacks, and the international community's efforts against terrorism. Russia's officials have portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the U.S. report notes that some rebels do not have international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The ministry suggests that the U.S. should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify some international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others.
