Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights. The report was published on Monday, and it's about Russia's human rights record, specifically mentioning Chechnya.

The Foreign Ministry is upset, calling the report "odious." They feel that the report is outdated, as if the writers didn't consider recent events like 9/11 or the global fight against terrorism. The U.S. report accuses Russia of media suppression and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings by both Russian forces and Chechen fighters.

Russia's officials, including Putin, view the Chechnya conflict as a fight against international terrorists. The U.S. partially agrees but has also criticized Russia's treatment of civilians, though they toned down their criticism after Russia joined the anti-terrorism coalition.

The Foreign Ministry thinks the report is influenced by U.S. groups opposing the new U.S.-Russia partnership against terrorism. They also point out that the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like not ratifying certain agreements and using the death penalty, before criticizing others.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Ministry's criticism of the report, mention the focus on Chechnya, the outdated nature of the report, and the accusations of human rights abuses. Then, I'll note Russia's perspective on the conflict as a war against terrorism and the U.S.'s mixed stance. Finally, I'll include the Ministry's suggestion that the U.S. address its own issues before criticizing Russia.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each key point is included without going over the word limit. I should also ensure the summary flows logically and covers all main aspects of the article.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and outdated. The report accuses Russia of poor media freedom and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings by both Russian forces and Chechen fighters. Russia views the Chechnya conflict as a fight against international terrorism, a stance partially endorsed by the U.S., though U.S. criticism of Russian civilian abuse has been toned down since Russia joined the anti-terrorism coalition. The Ministry claims the report reflects U.S. opposition to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism and suggests the U.S. address its own human rights issues, such as failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. END OF SUMMARY.
