SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, which highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and human rights abuses in Chechnya. The ministry accused the report's writers of being out of touch with recent events, including the 9/11 attacks and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report stated that Russian security forces in Chechnya have shown little respect for human rights, with credible reports of extrajudicial killings. The ministry countered that the US should focus on its own human rights issues, such as its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished. The ministry suggested that certain US circles are trying to undermine the US-Russian partnership against terrorism by reanimating the "Chechen problem".
