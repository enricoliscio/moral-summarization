SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and accusing the US of using old drafts that ignore recent events, including the 9/11 attacks. The report highlights Russia's poor human rights record, particularly in Chechnya, where Russian security forces have been accused of extrajudicial killings and other violations. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the US report notes that some rebels do not have international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian Foreign Ministry suggests that the US report is driven by "certain circles" opposed to the US-Russian partnership against terrorism and that the US should focus on its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty.
