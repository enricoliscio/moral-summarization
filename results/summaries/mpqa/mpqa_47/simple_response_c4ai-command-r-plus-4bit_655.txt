SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed strong disapproval of the U.S. State Department's critical report on Russia's human rights record, specifically regarding Chechnya. The Ministry suggested that the report ignored the recent strengthening of the U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism and the efforts made by Russia to improve its human rights situation, including the introduction of a moratorium on capital punishment. It also highlighted the double standards and hypocrisy of the United States, which itself has failed to ratify certain international human rights agreements and continues to practice the death penalty. The Ministry's response reflects a moral stance of upholding national sovereignty and mutual respect between nations, questioning the moral authority of the United States to judge others while having its own human rights shortcomings. END OF SUMMARY.
