SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly its "odious" section on Chechnya. The Ministry expressed surprise and dismay at the report's outdated and biased tone, suggesting that its writers relied on old drafts and ignored recent developments in both countries, including the united international front against terrorism following the September 2001 attacks. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, the U.S. report criticized Russia's poor record on media freedom and human rights violations by security forces, including extrajudicial killings. Russian officials have defended their actions in Chechnya as a necessary war against terrorism, a view partly endorsed by the U.S. Despite this, the U.S. has also noted the absence of international ties among some rebels and criticized abuses by Russian military and police forces. The Foreign Ministry attributed the criticism to "certain circles" in the U.S. opposed to the new partnership against international terrorism, accusing them of trying to reanimate the "Chechen problem." The Ministry also called on the U.S. to address its own human rights shortcomings, including the failure to ratify key international agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
