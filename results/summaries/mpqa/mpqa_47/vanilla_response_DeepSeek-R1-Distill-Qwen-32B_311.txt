Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with the Ministry criticizing a U.S. report as 'odious.' They're surprised by the criticism of Russia's human rights, especially regarding Chechnya. They mention that the report seems outdated, like it didn't account for recent events like 9/11 and the fight against terrorism.

The U.S. report accuses Russia of poor media freedom and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings by both sides. Russia's officials, including Putin, view Chechnya as a fight against international terrorists. U.S. officials partly agree but also criticize Russia's treatment of civilians, though they toned down criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition.

The Ministry claims the report is influenced by U.S. groups opposing the new partnership against terrorism. They suggest the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like not ratifying international agreements and using the death penalty, while Russia has a moratorium on capital punishment.

So, the key points are:
- Russia criticizes the U.S. human rights report as outdated and biased.
- The report highlights Chechnya issues, which Russia sees as part of the war on terror.
- The U.S. has toned down criticism after Russia's anti-terror cooperation.
- Russia points out U.S. human rights shortcomings.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all main points clearly.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report as outdated and biased, particularly its section on Chechnya. The ministry accused the report of using old drafts, ignoring recent global events like the 9/11 attacks and the international fight against terrorism. The U.S. report accused Russia of poor media freedom and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings by both Russian forces and Chechen fighters. Russia, led by President Putin, views the Chechnya conflict as a war against international terrorists, a stance partially endorsed by the U.S. However, the U.S. has also criticized Russian military and police abuses, though toned down its criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. The Russian ministry claimed the report reflects U.S. groups opposing the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism, suggesting the U.S. should address its own human rights issues, such as failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty, before criticizing others. Russia has a moratorium on capital punishment since 1996. END OF SUMMARY.
