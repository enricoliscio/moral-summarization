Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure, so I need to follow that closely. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the text again.

The article talks about the Ministry criticizing the U.S. report as "odious." That's a strong moral term. Then, the report mentions "surprised" but that's more of a reaction. The section on Chechnya is described as "odious," so that's another one. The Ministry says the U.S. report used "old drafts," which implies they're outdated, but not necessarily moral. 

The report accuses Russia of having a "poor record" regarding media freedom and mentions "basic human rights," "extrajudicial killings," and "abuse of civilians." These are all moral issues. The Ministry responds by saying the report reflects "certain circles" trying to create an irritant, which is a strategic move but not directly moral. 

They also mention the U.S. should look at their own issues like failing to ratify human rights agreements and using the death penalty. "Moratorium on capital punishment" is a policy choice with moral implications. 

So, the morally framed words I identified are: odious, poor, basic, extrajudicial, abuse, failure, moratorium. I think I missed "failure" initially but it's there when they talk about the U.S. not ratifying agreements. 

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words and keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Ministry's criticism, mention the "odious" section on Chechnya. Then, explain the U.S. report's accusations about media and human rights violations. Include the Russian perspective that it's a war against terrorism. Then, note the U.S. partial endorsement but criticism of abuses, which was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. Finally, the Ministry's point about the U.S. needing to address their own issues, like the death penalty and human rights failures. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral terms highlighted. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I think that's all. Time to put it together.

* failure  
* moratorium  

**SUMMARY:**  
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and "surprised" by its outdated approach. The report accused Russia of having a poor record on media freedom and human rights in Chechnya, where Russian forces were accused of extrajudicial killings and abuse of civilians. The Ministry defended Russia's counterterrorism efforts in Chechnya, framing it as a war against international terrorists. While the U.S. partially endorsed this view, it also criticized Russian abuses, though toned down its criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. The Ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of using the Chechen issue to disrupt the U.S.-Russian partnership. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights failures, such as the death penalty, before judging others. Russia has a moratorium on capital punishment, a requirement for its Council of Europe membership.
