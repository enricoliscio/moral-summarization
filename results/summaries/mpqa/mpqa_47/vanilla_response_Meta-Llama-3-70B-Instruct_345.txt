SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, which highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights abuses in Chechnya. The ministry described the report as "odious" and suggested that it was based on outdated information, ignoring recent events and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report accused Russian security forces in Chechnya of demonstrating little respect for basic human rights, with credible reports of extrajudicial killings. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the US report noted that some rebels do not have international ties and criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian ministry responded by suggesting that the US should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty.
