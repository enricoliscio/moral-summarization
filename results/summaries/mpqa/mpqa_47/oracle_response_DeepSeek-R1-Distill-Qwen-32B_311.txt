Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the author's moral stance.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Foreign Ministry is criticizing the U.S. report on human rights, particularly the section on Chechnya. They find it "odious" and suggest it's based on outdated drafts, ignoring recent events like 9/11 and the anti-terrorism efforts.

The article mentions the U.S. report's criticism of Russia's media freedom and human rights issues in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia sees Chechnya as a fight against terrorism, with some U.S. endorsement but also criticism of military abuses, which was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition.

The Ministry accuses U.S. "certain circles" of trying to revive the Chechen issue as a irritant in U.S.-Russian relations. They also point out the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues, like failing to ratify agreements and using the death penalty, while Russia has a moratorium.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words: closed, battle, terrorism, respect, violations, killings, abuse, sharing, opening, reanimate, turn, failure.

I'll start by stating the Ministry's criticism of the report as "odious." Mention the surprise and the outdated drafts. Highlight the battle against terrorism and the implication that the U.S. hasn't acknowledged recent efforts.

Then, note the U.S. report's findings on Chechnya, including violations and killings, while Russia frames it as a war against terrorism. Acknowledge partial U.S. support but criticism of abuse, which lessened after Russia's anti-terror cooperation.

The Ministry claims the report is from "certain circles" trying to reanimate the Chechen problem as an irritant. Finally, suggest the U.S. should address its own issues, like failure to ratify agreements and death penalty use, while Russia has a moratorium.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many moral words as possible without making it too verbose. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the criticism, the context, the opposing views, and the call for the U.S. to look inward.

Let me draft this, ensuring each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's human rights report, calling it "odious" and "based on outdated drafts." The report accused Russia of human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse of civilians, while Russia framed the conflict as a "battle against terrorism." The Ministry argued that the U.S. should focus on its own human rights issues, such as failing to ratify international agreements and using the death penalty, before judging others. It also accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of trying to "reanimate" the Chechen issue as an irritant in U.S.-Russian relations. The Ministry emphasized Russia's contributions to the anti-terror coalition, including sharing intelligence and opening airspace, while suggesting the report ignored recent global events like 9/11. Russia, having introduced a moratorium on capital punishment, urged the U.S. to address its shortcomings before criticizing others. END OF SUMMARY.
