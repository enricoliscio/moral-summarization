SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, specifically its section on Chechnya, calling it "odious." The Ministry suggested that the report ignored the recent joint U.S.-Russian efforts in the battle against international terrorism and the closing of ranks within the international community following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Ministry objected to the report's portrayal of Russia's record on media independence and freedom, as well as its criticism of Russian security forces in Chechnya, accusing them of serious violations and extrajudicial killings. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, the U.S. report also noted the existence of rebels without such ties and criticized Russian forces for abuse of civilians. The Foreign Ministry attributed the critical stance on Chechnya to "certain circles" within the U.S. who oppose the new partnership between the two countries in combating terrorism. The Ministry suggested that the U.S. should address its own human rights failures, including the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty, before judging others.
