SUMMARY:
The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The report claims that Russian security forces in Chechnya have "demonstrated little respect" for basic human rights, with "credible reports" of extrajudicial killings and other "serious violations". Russian officials have portrayed the conflict as a war against international terrorists, but the U.S. report notes that some rebels do not have international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian ministry accuses "certain circles" in the U.S. of trying to "reanimate" the Chechen problem and undermine the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism. The ministry also suggests that the U.S. should investigate its own human rights record, including its "failure" to ratify some international agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished.
