SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed outrage at the U.S. State Department's criticism of the country's human rights record, particularly regarding Chechnya. The Ministry accused the U.S. of ignoring the recent unity in the battle against terrorism and downplaying the role of international terrorists in the Chechen conflict. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists, the U.S. has criticized Russian forces for their abuse of civilians. The Ministry suggested that the U.S. should focus on its own human rights issues before judging others and highlighted Russia's moratorium on capital punishment as a step towards upholding human rights. This exchange underscores the tension between the two countries' approaches to human rights and counterterrorism efforts, with Russia prioritizing its war on terrorism and the U.S. expressing concern for civilian treatment.
