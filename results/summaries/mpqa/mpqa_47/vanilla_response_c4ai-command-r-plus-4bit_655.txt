SUMMARY: Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized a U.S. State Department report on human rights in Russia, specifically its section on Chechnya, as "odious" and based on outdated information. The Ministry suggested the report ignored recent developments in Russia-U.S. relations and the global fight against terrorism post-9/11. While acknowledging ties between Chechen rebels and international terrorism, U.S. officials also noted the lack of international connections for some rebels and criticized Russian forces for abusing civilians, but toned down their criticism after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition. Russia's Foreign Ministry attributed the criticism to "certain circles" in the U.S. opposing the new partnership between the two countries and trying to revive the "Chechen problem." The Ministry also pointed to the U.S.'s own human rights issues, including the failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 as a prerequisite for joining the Council of Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
