Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article discusses the U.S. State Department's report criticizing Russia's human rights record, particularly focusing on Chechnya. The Russian Foreign Ministry is upset, calling the report "odious" and suggesting it's outdated. They mention that the U.S. seems to ignore recent events like 9/11 and the global fight against terrorism. The report accuses Russia of media suppression and human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia, however, frames the conflict as a war against international terrorists, which the U.S. partially supports but also criticizes for civilian abuse. The Russian Ministry accuses the U.S. of using the Chechen issue to disrupt their partnership against terrorism. They also point out the U.S.'s own human rights issues, like the death penalty and failure to ratify agreements.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: closed, battle, terrorism, respect, violations, killings, abuse, sharing, opening, reanimate, turn, failure. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the Ministry's criticism of the U.S. report, mentioning the "odious" section on Chechnya. Then, I'll note the Ministry's view that the report ignores recent global efforts against terrorism. Next, I'll outline the U.S. report's accusations of media issues and human rights violations in Chechnya, including killings and abuse. I'll mention Russia's stance on the conflict as a war against terrorism and the U.S.'s partial support. Then, I'll highlight the Ministry's accusation that the U.S. is using the Chechen issue to disrupt their partnership. Finally, I'll include the Ministry's suggestion that the U.S. should address its own human rights issues, such as the death penalty and failures in ratifying agreements.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral terms. Let me put it all together now.

SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling its section on Chechnya "odious" and outdated. The ministry argued that the report ignored recent global efforts to "close ranks" in the "battle" against terrorism, particularly since 9/11. The U.S. report accused Russia of suppressing media independence and committing human rights "violations" in Chechnya, including "extrajudicial killings" and "abuse" of civilians. Russia, however, frames the Chechen conflict as a "war against international terrorists," a view partially endorsed by the U.S. The ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of trying to "reanimate" the Chechen issue to "turn" it into a source of tension in Russian-American relations. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights "failures," such as the use of the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements, before criticizing others. END OF SUMMARY.
