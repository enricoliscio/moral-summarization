Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing a U.S. State Department report on human rights in Russia, particularly focusing on Chechnya. 

The article mentions that the report was called "odious" by Russia. I need to note all the morally charged words. Let me go through the text again. Words like "odious," "criticism," "surprised," "old drafts," "nothing had happened," "Sept. 11," "battle against terrorism," "poor record," "independence and freedom of the media," "basic human rights," "extrajudicial killings," "abuse of civilians," "criticism toned down," "new U.S.-Russian partnership," "irritant," "failure to ratify," "capital punishment," "moratorium," "death penalty," "ratify," "human rights agreements," "opposition," "unjustified," "double standards," "selective application," "hypocrisy," "morality," "global," "hypocrisy," "inconsistencies," "priorities," "transparency," "accountability," "complicity," "criticism," "double standards," "hypocrisy," "morality," "global," "hypocrisy," "inconsistencies," "priorities," "transparency," "accountability," "complicity."

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. The summary should highlight the key points: Russia's criticism of the U.S. report, the focus on Chechnya, the mention of terrorism, the U.S. toned-down criticism, and the suggestion of double standards. I should structure it to show the moral arguments from both sides, ensuring the language reflects the original framing.

**SUMMARY:**

The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling it "odious" and questioning its relevance in light of recent global events like the September 11 attacks. The report accused Russia of having a poor human rights record, particularly in Chechnya, where Russian forces were accused of "extrajudicial killings" and "abuse of civilians." Russia, however, framed the conflict as a "war against international terrorists," a view partially endorsed by the U.S., though with toned-down criticism. The ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of using the Chechen issue to create discord in the new U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism. It also highlighted U.S. hypocrisy, pointing to its failure to ratify international human rights agreements and its use of the death penalty, while Russia had introduced a moratorium on capital punishment. The ministry emphasized the need for the U.S. to address its own human rights issues before criticizing others, suggesting a double standard in the global fight against terrorism. **END OF SUMMARY.**
