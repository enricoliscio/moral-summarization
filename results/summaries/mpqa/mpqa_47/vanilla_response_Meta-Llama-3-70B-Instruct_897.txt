SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, which highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights abuses in Chechnya. The ministry claimed the report was "odious" and seemed to be based on old drafts, ignoring recent events and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report stated that Russian security forces in Chechnya have shown little respect for human rights, with credible reports of extrajudicial killings. The Russian government has portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the US report noted that some rebels do not have international ties and criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that the US should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others.
