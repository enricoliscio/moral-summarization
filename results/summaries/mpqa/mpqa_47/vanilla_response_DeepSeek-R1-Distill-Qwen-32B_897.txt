Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Ministry criticizing the U.S. report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the Foreign Ministry is criticizing a U.S. State Department report on Russia's human rights record, specifically calling the section on Chechnya "odious." They're surprised by the report, feeling it's outdated and doesn't account for recent events like 9/11 and the international fight against terrorism.

The U.S. report accuses Russia of having a poor media freedom record and details human rights abuses in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings by both Russian forces and Chechen fighters. The Russian government, led by Putin, frames the Chechnya conflict as a war against international terrorists, which some U.S. officials agree with, pointing to links with al-Qaida. However, the U.S. also criticizes Russian military abuses, though this criticism was toned down after Russia joined the anti-terror coalition.

The Foreign Ministry argues that the U.S. report reflects efforts by certain American groups to disrupt the new U.S.-Russia partnership against terrorism. They suggest the U.S. should look at its own human rights issues before criticizing others, mentioning the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements. Russia has a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996.

So, the summary should cover the Ministry's criticism, the content of the U.S. report on Chechnya, the context of the conflict as a war on terror, the toned-down criticism due to the coalition, the Ministry's claim about American groups, and the U.S.'s own human rights issues.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words, making sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce the Ministry's criticism of the U.S. report, highlighting the Chechnya section as "odious."
2. Mention the U.S. report's accusations about human rights abuses in Chechnya.
3. Note the Russian government's stance on the conflict as a war against terrorism.
4. Explain the U.S. partial endorsement but toned-down criticism due to the anti-terror coalition.
5. Highlight the Ministry's claim about American groups trying to disrupt the partnership.
6. Conclude with the Ministry's suggestion for the U.S. to address its own issues, like the death penalty.

I think that covers all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally.
