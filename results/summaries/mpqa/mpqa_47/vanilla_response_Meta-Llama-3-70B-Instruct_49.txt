SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's annual human rights report, which highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and human rights abuses in Chechnya. The ministry described the report as "odious" and accused its writers of using old drafts, ignoring recent events and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report stated that Russian security forces in Chechnya have shown little respect for human rights, with credible reports of extrajudicial killings. The ministry countered that the report reflects the efforts of certain US circles opposed to the US-Russian partnership against terrorism. Russia also suggested that the US should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and the use of the death penalty, before judging others. Russia introduced a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996.
