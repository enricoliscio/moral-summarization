SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, specifically its section on Chechnya, calling it "odious." The Ministry suggested that the report ignored recent events, including the fight against international terrorism, and that it reflected the views of certain circles in the U.S. opposed to the new U.S.-Russian partnership. The U.S. report highlighted concerns about media independence and freedoms in Russia and the actions of Russian security forces in Chechnya, alleging serious human rights violations. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, U.S. officials also noted that not all rebels have international ties and criticized Russian military abuses. The Russian Ministry countered by suggesting the U.S. focus on its own human rights issues, including the failure to ratify key agreements and the use of the death penalty. This exchange highlights ongoing tensions between the two countries regarding human rights and the situation in Chechnya, despite their partnership in the war on terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
