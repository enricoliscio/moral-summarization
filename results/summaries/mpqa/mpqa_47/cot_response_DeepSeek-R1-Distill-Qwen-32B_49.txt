Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the task. The user wants me to identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, I notice several terms that carry moral connotations. Words like "criticizes," "odious," "surprised," "old drafts," "nothing had happened," "battle against terrorism," "poor record," "independence," "freedom," "demonstrated little respect," "credible reports," "extrajudicial killings," "abuse," "criticized," "new partnership," "reanimate," "irritant," "failure to ratify," and "capital punishment." These words indicate the moral stance of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll start by stating the Ministry's criticism of the U.S. report, highlighting the "odious" section on Chechnya. Then, I'll mention the surprise at the U.S. using outdated drafts and ignoring recent events. I'll note the U.S. report's concerns about media freedom and human rights violations in Chechnya, while Russia frames the conflict as a fight against terrorism. I'll include the partial endorsement by the U.S. but also their toned-down criticism due to Russia's anti-terrorism efforts. Finally, I'll point out the Ministry's suggestion that the U.S. should look inward before criticizing others, mentioning the death penalty and unratified agreements.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence encapsulates the main ideas and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, calling its section on Chechnya "odious." The ministry expressed surprise that the report seemed to rely on outdated drafts, ignoring recent global events like the fight against terrorism. The U.S. report accused Russia of poor media freedom and human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russia, however, frames the Chechnya conflict as a battle against international terrorists, a view partially endorsed by the U.S. while also criticizing Russian military abuse. The ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of trying to revive the "Chechen problem" as an irritant in U.S.-Russian relations. It also urged the U.S. to address its own human rights issues, such as the death penalty and failure to ratify international agreements, before judging others.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
