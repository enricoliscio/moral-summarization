SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The ministry expressed surprise and disappointment, suggesting that the report's writers seemed to have ignored recent events, including the 9/11 attacks and the international community's united stance against terrorism. The report highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse of civilians by both government forces and Chechen fighters. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict as a battle against international terrorism, but the U.S. report noted that some rebels lack international ties. The ministry accused "certain circles" in the U.S. of trying to revive the "Chechen problem" and undermine the U.S.-Russian partnership against terrorism. The ministry also called on the U.S. to investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty.
