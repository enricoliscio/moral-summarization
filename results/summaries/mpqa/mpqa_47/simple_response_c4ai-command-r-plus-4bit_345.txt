SUMMARY: The Foreign Ministry of Russia expressed strong disapproval of the U.S. State Department's critical report on Russia's human rights record, specifically regarding Chechnya. They accused the report of being outdated and ignoring the international context of the war on terrorism post-9/11. The U.S. report highlighted concerns about media freedom and human rights abuses in Chechnya by both Russian forces and Chechen fighters. While acknowledging the presence of international terrorists in Chechnya, U.S. officials have also noted the absence of international ties among some rebels and criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that the report reflects the bias of certain U.S. circles against the new U.S.-Russian partnership and their attempts to undermine it by focusing on the "Chechen problem." Russia also pointed out that the U.S. should address its own human rights issues before judging others, including the failure to ratify key human rights agreements and the continued use of the death penalty. This debate highlights the complex interplay between geopolitical interests, the war on terror, and human rights concerns, with Russia emphasizing its commitment to counterterrorism and calling for a more balanced and current assessment of the situation.
