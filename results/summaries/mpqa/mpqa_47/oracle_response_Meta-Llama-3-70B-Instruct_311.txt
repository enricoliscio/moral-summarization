SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, calling it "odious" and accusing the writers of being out of touch with recent events. The report highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse by both government and rebel forces. The ministry claimed that the report reflected the efforts of "certain circles" in the US to undermine the new partnership against international terrorism. The ministry suggested that the US should focus on its own human rights issues, such as its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others. The report's criticism of Russia's actions in Chechnya, where the government claims to be fighting terrorism, was seen as particularly galling. The ministry's statement emphasized the need for cooperation in the "battle" against terrorism, and implied that the US report was a step backwards in this effort.
