SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly the section on Chechnya, calling it "odious". The ministry claims the report shows no respect for Russia's efforts in the battle against terrorism, and that the writers seem to have ignored recent events, including the 9/11 attacks. The report highlights Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as serious human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse of civilians by both government and rebel forces. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict as a war against international terrorism, but the US report notes that some rebels have no international ties. The ministry suggests that the report reflects the efforts of "certain circles" in the US to undermine the new US-Russian partnership against terrorism. The ministry also points out the US's own failures, including its failure to ratify international human rights agreements and its use of the death penalty, which Russia has abolished.
