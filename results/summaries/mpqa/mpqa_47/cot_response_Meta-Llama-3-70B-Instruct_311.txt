SUMMARY:
The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, calling the section on Chechnya "odious". The ministry expressed surprise at the report's criticism, suggesting that it seemed to ignore recent events and the international community's efforts against terrorism. The report highlighted Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as serious human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict in Chechnya as a war against international terrorists, but the U.S. report noted that some rebels do not have international ties and criticized Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The ministry suggested that the U.S. should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify certain international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others.
