SUMMARY:

The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticized the US State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly the section on Chechnya, calling it "odious". The ministry claims that the report's writers seem to have ignored recent events, including the 9/11 attacks and the international community's united battle against terrorism. The report highlights Russia's poor record on media independence and freedom, as well as human rights violations in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings and abuse by both government and rebel forces. Russian officials have portrayed the conflict as a war against international terrorism, but the US report notes that some rebels have no international ties and criticizes Russian military and police abuse of civilians. The ministry suggests that the US should investigate its own human rights record, including its failure to ratify international agreements and its use of the death penalty, before judging others.
