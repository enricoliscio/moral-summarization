SUMMARY: The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. State Department's report on Russia's human rights record, particularly its section on Chechnya, as outdated and biased. The Ministry argued that the report ignored recent developments in Russia-U.S. relations and the international fight against terrorism. While acknowledging ties between Chechen rebels and al-Qaida, U.S. officials also noted the lack of international ties among some rebels and criticized Russian military abuse of civilians. The Foreign Ministry attributed the criticism to "certain circles" in the U.S. opposing the new partnership against terrorism, and suggested the U.S. address its own human rights issues, including the death penalty. The U.S. report highlighted concerns about media freedom and human rights violations in Chechnya by both Russian forces and rebels. Russia's introduction of a moratorium on capital punishment in 1996 was also mentioned.
