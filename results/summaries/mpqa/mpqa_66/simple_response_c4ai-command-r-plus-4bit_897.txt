SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations—the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—have issued a joint statement expressing concern that the fight against terrorism not come at the expense of human rights. The statement comes in response to recent events, including the passing of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, which have raised worries about potential violations of fundamental freedoms. The organizations urge all governments to refrain from excessive measures that would undermine legitimate dissent and violate human rights. They stress the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and remind states of their international obligations to uphold these rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement also cautions against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. This moral stance is crucial as it emphasizes the inherent value of human rights and freedoms, even in the face of challenging circumstances like the fight against terrorism. It also underscores the importance of international cooperation and adherence to shared moral standards in upholding these values globally. END OF SUMMARY.
