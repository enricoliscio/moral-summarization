SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext to violate human rights. The Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over recent "worrying developments" in some countries, where human rights are being undermined in the name of combating terrorism. They urged governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent. The organizations emphasized the importance of upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms, even in the face of terrorism. They listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent incidents, including the detention of terrorist suspects without trial in the UK and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations called for restraint and a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms.
