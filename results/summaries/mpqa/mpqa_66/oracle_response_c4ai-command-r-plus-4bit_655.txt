SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations have warned that the fight against terrorism must not lead to violations of human rights. The statement, issued jointly by the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, comes in response to recent worrying developments in some countries, including the UK's emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urge governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent. They stress the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and upholding fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement also cautions against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties and calls for restraint in the expansion of military campaigns. This timely reminder highlights the potential for abuse and the need to maintain moral integrity in the face of challenging circumstances. It serves as a moral compass, guiding governments and societies alike in their efforts to combat terrorism without compromising the very values they seek to protect.
