Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. 

The article is about three international organizations warning that fighting terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. The organizations are the Council of Europe, OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. They made a joint statement in response to concerns after the September 11 attacks. 

They mention that while terrorism requires specific measures, governments shouldn't take excessive steps that violate fundamental freedoms. They emphasize adhering to international obligations. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner, is particularly critical, noting the impact on civil liberties. 

The statement comes after the UK passed legislation allowing detention without trial and the deaths of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. Amnesty International called for an inquiry. The groups stress balancing security and freedoms, listing essential rights like the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also warn against retroactive penalties. The US considering expanding the war to Iraq is mentioned, with criticism from Germany and France.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the organizations and their warning. Then mention the response to 9/11, the call for not violating rights, the examples of UK legislation and Afghanistan incident, the rights emphasized, and the mention of the US's possible expansion of the war with criticism. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is included without extra details.
