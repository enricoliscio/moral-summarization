SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations have issued a joint statement expressing concern that the fight against terrorism should not result in a violation of human rights. The statement, released by the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, comes in response to recent worrying developments in some countries, including the passage of emergency legislation in Britain and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The statement emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and calls on governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate human rights and undermine legitimate dissent. It also highlights essential rights that must be upheld, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The organizations caution against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties and urge restraint in the expansion of military campaigns. This cautionary message underscores the delicate balance between maintaining security and preserving moral and ethical values in the fight against terrorism, with a clear stand against human rights abuses and the undermining of civil liberties.
