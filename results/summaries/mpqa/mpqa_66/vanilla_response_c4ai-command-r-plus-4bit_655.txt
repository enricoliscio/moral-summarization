SUMMARY: On November 29, 2001, three prominent international organizations—the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issued a joint statement expressing concern over potential human rights violations in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The statement, released in Strasbourg, Geneva, and Warsaw, emphasized the need for governments to balance national security concerns with their commitment to uphold fundamental freedoms and human rights. It highlighted specific rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement came in response to recent developments, such as the passage of emergency legislation in the UK allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, which raised concerns about potential abuses. The organizations urged governments to refrain from excessive measures and to ensure their actions in the fight against terrorism remain consistent with international law and respect for human rights. This warning followed hints from the US about expanding the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, which prompted calls for restraint from Germany and France.
