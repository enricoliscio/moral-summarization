SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have issued a joint statement warning against using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for violating human rights. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries, citing the need for governments to balance national security concerns with fundamental freedoms. The statement highlighted essential rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. It also urged against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The warning comes amidst recent controversial measures, such as the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations emphasized the importance of upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism.
