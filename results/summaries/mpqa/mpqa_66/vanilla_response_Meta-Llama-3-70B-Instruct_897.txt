SUMMARY:

Three international organizations - the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights - have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not lead to human rights violations. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries, including the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged governments to strike a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and to uphold essential rights such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also cautioned against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The statement comes as the US considers expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, prompting criticism from Germany and France.
