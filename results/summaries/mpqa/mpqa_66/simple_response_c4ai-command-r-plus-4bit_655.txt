SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations—the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—have issued a joint statement warning against the violation of human rights in the name of counterterrorism efforts. The statement comes in response to recent events, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, that raise concerns about the potential erosion of fundamental freedoms. 

The organizations emphasize the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and the upholding of human rights and freedoms, as outlined in international law. They specifically highlight the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture as essential rights that must be protected. 

The statement serves as a reminder that the fight against terrorism must not be used as an excuse to disregard moral and legal obligations to respect and protect human rights. It underscores the need for governments to act within the bounds of their international commitments, even as they navigate the challenges posed by terrorism.
