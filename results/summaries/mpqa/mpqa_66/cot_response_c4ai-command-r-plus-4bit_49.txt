SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not come at the expense of human rights. This statement comes in response to worrying developments in some countries, where human rights violations have occurred following the September 11 attacks. The organizations recognize the need for specific measures to address the threat of terrorism but call on governments to refrain from excessive steps that would violate fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. They emphasize the essential duty of states to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms while combating terrorism, striking a balance between national security concerns and international law commitments. The statement highlights several key rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. It also urges governments to avoid the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties for crimes. The organizations further caution against expanding the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, with Germany and France specifically calling for restraint. This joint statement serves as a reminder that even in times of crisis, the protection of human rights and freedoms must remain a priority. END OF SUMMARY.
