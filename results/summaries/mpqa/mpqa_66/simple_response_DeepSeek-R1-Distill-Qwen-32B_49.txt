Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about three international organizations warning against human rights violations in the fight against terrorism. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the organizations involved (Council of Europe, OSCE, UN High Commissioner), their concern about recent developments post-9/11, the call for governments to avoid excessive measures, and the mention of specific rights that shouldn't be compromised. Also, there's the British legislation and the Afghan prison incident as examples.

I should start by stating the joint warning, then mention the organizations. Highlight their main concern about terrorism measures not violating rights. Include the specific rights they emphasized. Also, note the examples like Britain's legislation and the prison killings. Conclude with their call for balance between security and freedoms.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspect is clear—emphasizing the protection of human rights despite the fight against terrorism.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—jointly warned that the fight against terrorism must not justify human rights violations. They expressed concern over recent developments, particularly after the September 11 attacks, urging governments to avoid excessive measures that could infringe on fundamental freedoms. The statement emphasized the importance of adhering to international obligations to protect rights such as the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. It also cautioned against retroactive imposition of harsher penalties. The call came amid concerns over Britain's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations stressed the need for a balance between national security and fundamental freedoms, urging governments to uphold human rights commitments. END OF SUMMARY.
