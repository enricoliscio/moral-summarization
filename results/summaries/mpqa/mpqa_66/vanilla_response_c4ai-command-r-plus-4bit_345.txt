SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations – the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – issued a joint statement expressing concern over potential human rights violations in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The statement, released in Strasbourg, Geneva, and Warsaw, urged governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent in the name of fighting terrorism. It emphasized the importance of upholding human rights and striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, listing essential rights such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement also cautioned against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. This comes as the British House of Commons passed controversial emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, and amid concerns about the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations' statement serves as a reminder that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of international law and respect for human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
