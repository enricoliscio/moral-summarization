Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about three international organizations—Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't be an excuse for violating human rights. They mention recent developments after 9/11, so that's the context. They issued a joint statement emphasizing that while terrorism is a threat, governments shouldn't overstep and violate fundamental freedoms. They stress the importance of adhering to international obligations regarding human rights.

Mary Robinson is highlighted as a critical voice, pointing out that the war on terrorism is harming civil liberties. The statement comes after the UK passed emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the tragic event in Afghanistan where Taliban inmates were killed. Amnesty International called for an inquiry there.

The groups emphasize balancing national security with fundamental freedoms, listing key rights like right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also advise against retroactive severe penalties. The US considering expanding the war to Iraq is mentioned, with criticism from Germany and France.

So, the moral framing here is that while combating terrorism is necessary, it must not come at the expense of human rights. The organizations are cautioning against excessive measures that infringe on freedoms, highlighting the need for a balance.

Now, to summarize this concisely, I need to include the organizations, their main warning, the context of 9/11, the specific points about not violating rights, the examples like UK legislation and the Afghanistan incident, and the call for balance. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be succinct but cover all key elements.

I should start by mentioning the organizations and their joint warning. Then, explain that terrorism measures shouldn't violate rights, referencing 9/11. Include the specific rights they listed and the examples of UK and Afghanistan. Mention the call for balance and the criticism of potential expansion to Iraq. Conclude with the moral stance against human rights violations in the fight against terrorism.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all points are covered without exceeding the word limit.
