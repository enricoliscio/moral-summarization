SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have issued a joint warning that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext to violate human rights. They express concern over recent developments in some countries that threaten fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations stress that governments must strike a balance between national security concerns and human rights, and that certain rights, such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture, cannot be compromised. They also urge against the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties for crimes. The warning comes as the UK passes emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the US hints at expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan. The organizations emphasize that upholding human rights is essential in the fight against terrorism.
