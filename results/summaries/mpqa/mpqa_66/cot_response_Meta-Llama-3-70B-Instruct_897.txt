SUMMARY:
Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have warned that the fight against terrorism should not lead to the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries, where governments are taking "excessive steps" that undermine fundamental freedoms and "legitimate dissent". The organizations emphasized that it is "essential" for states to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism, and to strike a balance between national security concerns and individual rights. They listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent developments, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
