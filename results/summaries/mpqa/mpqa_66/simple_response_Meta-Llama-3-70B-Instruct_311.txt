SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have issued a joint warning that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext to violate human rights. They express concern over recent developments in some countries that have compromised fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations emphasize the importance of balancing national security concerns with human rights and fundamental freedoms, consistent with international law commitments. They highlight essential rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent incidents, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urge governments to refrain from excessive measures that could undermine human rights and legitimate dissent.
