SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations – the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – issued a joint statement expressing concern over potential human rights violations in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The statement, released on November 29, warned governments against using the fight against terrorism as an excuse to violate fundamental freedoms and human rights. It emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with the protection of fundamental freedoms, such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement also advised against the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties for crimes. This warning comes as the British government passes controversial emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, and amidst concerns over the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged all governments to uphold their international obligations to respect human rights, even in the face of the threat of terrorism.
