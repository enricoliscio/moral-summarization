SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have warned against using the fight against terrorism as a pretext to violate human rights. They urge governments to strike a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, ensuring that measures taken to combat terrorism do not undermine legitimate dissent and human rights. The organizations emphasize the importance of upholding essential rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also caution against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The warning comes in response to recent developments, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations stress that governments must adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism.
