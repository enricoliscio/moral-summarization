SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext to violate human rights. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries, including the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations stressed the importance of balancing national security concerns with fundamental freedoms, and listed essential rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also urged against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The warning comes as the US considers expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.
