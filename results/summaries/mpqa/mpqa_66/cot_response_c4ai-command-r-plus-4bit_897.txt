SUMMARY: 
Three prominent international organizations have issued a joint warning against potential human rights violations in the name of counterterrorism efforts. Recent "worrying developments" in certain countries regarding human rights, following the September 11 attacks, have sparked this response. The warning emphasizes the importance of refraining from excessive measures that may infringe on fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. 

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, alongside representatives from the Council of Europe and the OSCE, stressed that states must adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and legitimate freedoms while fighting terrorism. The statement highlights the potential toll on civil liberties and the need to balance national security concerns with fundamental rights, such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. 

The timing of the statement is significant, coming shortly after the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, which Amnesty International condemned. The organizations urge governments to strike a balance and honor their international law commitments, avoiding excessive measures and retroactive imposition of harsher punishments for crimes. The potential expansion of the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan has also drawn criticism, with Germany and France advocating for restraint to avoid further moral dilemmas and potential human rights abuses.
