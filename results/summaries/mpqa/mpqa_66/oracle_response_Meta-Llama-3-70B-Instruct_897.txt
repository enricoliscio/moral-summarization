SUMMARY: The Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a joint statement warning against the violation of human rights in the fight against terrorism. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries following the September 11 attacks, where measures to combat terrorism have led to abuses and undermined fundamental freedoms. The organizations emphasized the need to uphold human rights and freedoms, while recognizing the threat of terrorism requires specific measures. They urged governments to refrain from excessive steps that would violate human rights, such as detention without trial and torture. The statement listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The organizations called for a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and for an inquiry into the recent killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The statement serves as a critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
