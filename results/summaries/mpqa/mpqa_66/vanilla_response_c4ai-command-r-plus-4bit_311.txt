SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations – the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – have issued a joint statement expressing concern that the fight against terrorism should not come at the expense of human rights. The statement comes in response to recent developments, such as the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, which they believe could result in violations of fundamental freedoms. The organizations emphasize the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and the protection of human rights, specifically highlighting the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also caution against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The statement comes as the US hints at expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, drawing criticism from Germany and France. The organizations urge all governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate human rights and undermine legitimate dissent in the name of counterterrorism efforts.
