SUMMARY:

Three international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as an excuse to violate human rights. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries that have compromised fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations emphasized the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and human rights, and listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The warning comes amidst recent events, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK allowing detention without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged governments to strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms.
