Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about three international organizations warning against using the fight against terrorism as an excuse to violate human rights. They mention specific concerns after 9/11, like excessive measures and the impact on civil liberties.

The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key entities: Council of Europe, OSCE, UN High Commissioner. They issued a joint statement, so that's important.

I should note the context—recent worrying developments in some countries. The statement emphasizes not taking excessive steps that violate freedoms. Mentioning the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture is crucial. Also, the part about not imposing retroactive penalties is a key point.

Including the examples like the UK passing emergency legislation and the killings in Afghanistan adds context. The call for an inquiry and the balance between security and freedoms are important too. The US's plan to expand the war and the criticism from Germany and France should be included to show the broader implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, using the morally framed words naturally. I'll structure it to first state the warning, then the context, the key rights, the examples, and the call for balance and restraint. Keeping each sentence concise will help stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all the main points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. Making sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the essential elements without unnecessary details.
