SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations have issued a joint warning against human rights violations in the name of counterterrorism. The statement, released by the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, comes in response to recent concerning developments in some countries, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations emphasize the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, urging governments to refrain from excessive measures that violate human rights and undermine legitimate dissent. UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson has been a particularly critical voice, warning that the fight against terrorism should not come at the expense of civil liberties. The statement highlights essential rights that must be upheld, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. It also calls for restraint in the expansion of the military campaign beyond Afghanistan, as hinted at by the US, and for avoiding the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties. The organizations stand firmly against any violation of human rights and international law commitments in the name of counterterrorism efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
