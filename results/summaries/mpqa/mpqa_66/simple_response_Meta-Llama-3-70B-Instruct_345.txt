SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have jointly warned against using the fight against terrorism as a pretext to violate human rights. They emphasize that while specific measures are needed to combat terrorism, governments must refrain from excessive steps that undermine fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations stress that states must adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also caution against retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The warning comes amid concerns over recent developments, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK allowing detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urge governments to strike a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms.
