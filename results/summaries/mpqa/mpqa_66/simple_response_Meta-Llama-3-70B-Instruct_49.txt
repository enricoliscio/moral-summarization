SUMMARY:

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as an excuse to violate human rights. They are concerned about recent developments in some countries that threaten fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations stress that states must adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, even in the face of terrorism. They emphasize the importance of balancing national security concerns with human rights, and list essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The warning comes amidst recent controversial measures, such as the British emergency legislation allowing detention without trial, and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urge governments to avoid excessive measures that could undermine human rights and the rule of law.
