SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations – the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – have issued a joint statement expressing concern over potential human rights violations in the fight against terrorism. The statement comes in response to recent worrying developments, such as the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, which could result in excessive measures that infringe on fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. 

The organizations stress the importance of maintaining a balance between national security concerns and the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They urge governments to refrain from taking excessive steps that violate international law commitments and undermine legitimate dissent. 

The statement also highlights the potential negative consequences of the war on terrorism on civil liberties and calls for governments to uphold their international obligations to uphold human rights. The organizations caution against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes, emphasizing the need to maintain legitimate legal processes. 

The joint statement serves as a timely reminder that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within a framework that respects moral values and upholds international human rights commitments.
