Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about three international organizations—Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issuing a joint warning. They're concerned that the fight against terrorism isn't being used as an excuse to violate human rights. They mention "worrying developments" in some countries after 9/11.

I should note that they emphasize the importance of not taking excessive measures against terrorism that infringe on fundamental freedoms. They stress adherence to international obligations. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner, is particularly critical, pointing out the impact on civil liberties.

The summary also needs to include specific examples: the UK passing legislation allowing detention without trial and the Taliban inmate deaths in Afghanistan. Amnesty International called for an inquiry there. The organizations stress balancing national security with human rights, listing key rights that shouldn't be compromised. Lastly, the US considering expanding the war to Iraq, with criticism from Germany and France.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the organizations and their warning, then the examples, and finally the key points about rights and the US's potential actions. Making sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—jointly warned on November 29 that the fight against terrorism should not justify human rights violations. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries following the September 11 attacks, urging governments to avoid excessive measures that could infringe on fundamental freedoms. The statement emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with human rights obligations under international law. Essential rights, such as the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture, must not be compromised. The organizations also opposed retroactive imposition of harsher penalties. This warning came amid the UK passing emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, prompting calls for an inquiry. The UN's Mary Robinson highlighted the war on terrorism's impact on civil liberties. Additionally, the US considering expanding its military campaign to Iraq drew criticism from Germany and France.
