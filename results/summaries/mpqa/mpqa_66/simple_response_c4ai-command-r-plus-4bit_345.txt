SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations—the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—have issued a joint statement expressing concern that the fight against terrorism not infringe on human rights. The statement comes in response to recent events, such as the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, that have raised worries about potential human rights violations. The organizations emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and remind governments of their obligation to uphold international human rights law, even in times of crisis. They specifically highlight the rights to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture as non-negotiable, and caution against the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties for crimes. The statement serves as a timely reminder that the fight against terrorism must not come at the expense of the very values and freedoms we seek to protect. END OF SUMMARY.
