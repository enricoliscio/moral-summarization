Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about three international organizations warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. They mention the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner. They're responding to developments post-9/11.

I should highlight their main points: recognizing the threat of terrorism but cautioning against excessive measures. They emphasize adhering to international obligations. Mary Robinson is a key figure here, pointing out the impact on civil liberties.

Also, the article mentions specific events like the UK passing emergency legislation and the Taliban inmate killings. These are important to include as examples of the issues they're addressing.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without losing the moral emphasis on human rights versus security measures.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issued a joint warning on November 29, emphasizing that the fight against terrorism must not justify human rights violations. They expressed concern over recent developments, particularly in the wake of the September 11 attacks, urging governments to avoid excessive measures that could infringe on fundamental freedoms. The statement stressed the importance of balancing national security with human rights, citing essential rights such as the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson highlighted the toll the war on terrorism was taking on civil liberties. The warning came amid concerns over UK emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations called for adherence to international law and urged against retroactive penalties for crimes. The statement also criticized potential military expansion beyond Afghanistan, urging restraint. END OF SUMMARY.
