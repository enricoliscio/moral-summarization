SUMMARY: Three prominent international organizations have jointly warned against human rights violations in the name of counterterrorism efforts. The Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over recent events where countries have used the fight against terrorism as a pretext to violate human rights and fundamental freedoms. They urged governments to refrain from excessive measures that would undermine legitimate dissent and violate fundamental freedoms, emphasizing the importance of upholding human rights obligations. The statement comes amid worrying developments, such as the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations stressed the need to balance national security concerns with respect for international law and highlighted essential rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also cautioned against the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties and urged restraint in the expansion of military campaigns. The moral framing of the article centers around the potential conflict between counterterrorism measures and human rights, with words like "violate," "undermine," "uphold," and "abuses" illustrating the delicate balance between security and freedom. The organizations' statement is a call to protect moral values and prevent justifications for immoral actions in the name of counterterrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
