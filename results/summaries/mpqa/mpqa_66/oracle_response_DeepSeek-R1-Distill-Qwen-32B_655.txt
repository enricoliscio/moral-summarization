Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about three international organizations warning against human rights violations in the fight against terrorism, especially after 9/11. They mention specific concerns like excessive measures, detention without trial, and the situation in Afghanistan.

The user wants the summary to include as many morally framed words as possible from the list provided. I should identify those words in the article and ensure they're included. Words like "violation," "attacks," "terrorism," "measures," "uphold," etc., are key here.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the organizations and their concern. Then, mention the joint statement's call for governments to avoid excessive measures. Highlight the specific examples like the UK legislation and the Afghan prison killings. Also, include the emphasis on balancing security with human rights and the rights that shouldn't be hollowed out.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the warning, the call to action, examples, and the necessary balance. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Finally, I'll ensure the summary ends properly with the specified tokens.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate without making it sound forced. The summary should clearly convey the organizations' stance and the moral implications they're highlighting.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—warned that the fight against terrorism must not justify human rights violations. They criticized recent developments, such as the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The groups emphasized the need to balance legitimate security concerns with fundamental freedoms, urging governments to uphold international obligations. They highlighted essential rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture, and opposed retroactive penalties. The statement also called for restraint in military actions, following U.S. hints of expanding the war to Iraq. The organizations stressed that counterterrorism measures must not undermine human rights or legitimate dissent. END OF SUMMARY.
