SUMMARY:

Three international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have issued a joint statement warning against the violation of human rights in the fight against terrorism. They expressed concern over recent developments in some countries, including the detention of terrorist suspects without trial in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations emphasized the need for governments to strike a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and to uphold international human rights law commitments. They listed essential rights that must be protected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes as the US considers expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, prompting criticism from Germany and France.
