SUMMARY:
Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for violating human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries, where "excessive steps" are being taken, undermining "fundamental freedoms" and "legitimate dissent". The organizations emphasized that it is "essential" for states to uphold human rights and "fundamental freedoms" in the fight against terrorism, and to strike a balance between "legitimate national security concerns" and individual rights. They also listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent developments, including the passing of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
