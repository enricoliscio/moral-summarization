SUMMARY:
Leading international organizations, including the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have warned that the fight against terrorism should not lead to the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries, where governments have taken "excessive steps" that undermine "fundamental freedoms" and "legitimate dissent". The organizations emphasized that it is "essential" for states to uphold human rights and "strictly adhere" to international obligations. They listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent developments, including the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged governments to strike a balance between "legitimate national security concerns" and "fundamental freedoms".
