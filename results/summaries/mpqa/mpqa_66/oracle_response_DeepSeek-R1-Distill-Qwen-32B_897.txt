Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article to identify the key points.

The article mentions three international organizations warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. They're responding to developments post-9/11. They stress that while terrorism requires specific measures, governments shouldn't take excessive steps that violate freedoms or undermine dissent.

They also mention the UK passing legislation allowing detention without trial and the killings in Afghanistan, prompting an inquiry. The groups emphasize balancing national security with freedoms, listing essential rights like life, expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They warn against retroactive penalties and the US's possible expansion of the war to Iraq, with criticism from Germany and France.

I should include words like violation, terrorism, measures, violate, undermine, uphold, fight, abuses, toll, trial, killing, inquiry, strike, freedoms, hollowed, freedom, torture, avoided, restraint.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring all key moral terms are included without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—warned that the fight against terrorism must not be a pretext for human rights violations. They criticized recent developments post-9/11, urging governments to avoid excessive measures that could violate fundamental freedoms and undermine dissent. The organizations emphasized the importance of adhering to international obligations to uphold human rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also cautioned against retroactive imposition of harsher penalties. The statement came amid concerns over the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, prompting calls for an inquiry. The groups stressed the need to balance legitimate national security concerns with fundamental freedoms, urging restraint in military campaigns, particularly as the US hinted at expanding the war to Iraq.
