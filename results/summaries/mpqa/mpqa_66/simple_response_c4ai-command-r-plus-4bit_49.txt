SUMMARY: Three leading international organizations – the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights – issued a joint statement expressing concern that the fight against terrorism not be used as a pretext for violating human rights. The statement comes in response to recent worrying developments, such as the passage of emergency legislation in the UK allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations emphasized the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and reminded governments of their obligation to uphold international human rights law. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson has been a particularly vocal critic of human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks, warning that the war on terrorism is taking a toll on civil liberties. The organizations listed several essential rights that must be respected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They also advised against the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. The statement serves as a timely reminder that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within a framework that respects and protects human rights and moral values. END OF SUMMARY.
