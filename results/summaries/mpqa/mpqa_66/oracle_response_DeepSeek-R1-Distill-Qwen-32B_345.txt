Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the ethical concerns presented in the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about three international organizations warning against using the fight against terrorism as an excuse to violate human rights. They mention specific concerns like excessive measures, the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also reference recent events like the British legislation and the prison killings in Afghanistan.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. The list provided includes words like "violation," "attacks," "terrorism," "abuses," "toll," etc. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

I'll start by outlining the key points: the organizations' warning, the recognition of the threat of terrorism, the call for governments to avoid excessive measures, the specific rights they highlighted, and the recent events mentioned. 

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the organizations' statement, their recognition of the terrorism threat, the call for balance, the rights emphasized, and then mention the recent events and the call for restraint.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be precise with each point. Also, using the morally charged words will help convey the ethical concerns effectively.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary elements and the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issued a joint warning against using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for human rights violations. They expressed concern over recent developments, such as the UK's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The statement emphasized the need to balance legitimate national security concerns with fundamental freedoms, urging governments to adhere to international law commitments. Essential rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture, must not be hollowed out. The organizations also warned against retroactive imposition of harsher penalties and called for restraint in military actions, such as the potential expansion of the war to Iraq. END OF SUMMARY.
