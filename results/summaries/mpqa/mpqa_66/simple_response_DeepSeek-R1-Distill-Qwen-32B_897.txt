Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about three international organizations warning that fighting terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. They're responding to recent developments after 9/11. The key points are the organizations involved, their call for governments to avoid excessive measures, the mention of specific rights, and the context of recent events like the UK legislation and the prison incident in Afghanistan. I should make sure to include all these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it by introducing the organizations, their main concern, the specific rights they highlighted, and the context of recent events. That should cover the moral aspect of balancing security with human rights.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issued a joint warning that the fight against terrorism must not justify human rights violations. They criticized recent measures in some countries, emphasizing that while counter-terrorism efforts are necessary, they must not infringe on fundamental freedoms. The statement stressed the importance of upholding rights such as freedom of expression, religion, and the right to life, while avoiding retroactive penalties and torture. This call came amid concerns over UK emergency legislation allowing indefinite detention of suspects and the deaths of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged governments to balance national security with human rights, adhering to international law. The UN High Commissioner, Mary Robinson, highlighted the impact of the "war on terror" on civil liberties, and the statement also noted criticism of potential US military action beyond Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
