SUMMARY: On November 29, 2001, three prominent international organizations—the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—issued a joint statement expressing concern over potential human rights violations in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The statement was prompted by recent events, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, that raised concerns about the balance between national security and fundamental freedoms. The organizations urged governments to uphold their international obligations to protect human rights and maintain a balance between security concerns and fundamental freedoms, listing several essential rights that must be respected, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes as the US hints at expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan, a move that has already drawn criticism from Germany and France. The organizations emphasized the importance of adhering to international law and avoiding excessive measures that could undermine legitimate dissent and violate fundamental human rights.
