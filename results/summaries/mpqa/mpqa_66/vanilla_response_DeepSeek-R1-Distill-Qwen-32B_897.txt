Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about three international organizations warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. They mentioned the Council of Europe, OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. They're responding to recent developments after 9/11.

Hmm, the key points are that while terrorism is a threat, governments shouldn't overstep and violate freedoms. They issued a joint statement emphasizing adherence to international obligations. Mary Robinson from the UN was critical about the impact on civil liberties.

Also, there's mention of the UK passing emergency laws for detention without trial and the deaths in Afghanistan, prompting an inquiry. The groups stressed balancing security with freedoms and listed essential rights like life, expression, religion, and freedom from torture.

Additionally, the US considering expanding the war to Iraq got criticism from Germany and France. So, the summary needs to capture all these elements concisely, within 200 words.

I should structure it by introducing the organizations, their warning, the context of 9/11, the call for balance, specific rights, and the mention of the UK and US actions. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.
