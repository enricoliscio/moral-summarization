SUMMARY: Three leading international organisations have warned that the fight against terrorism must not lead to violations of human rights. The Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a joint statement expressing concern over recent developments in some countries, where fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent have been threatened under the guise of anti-terrorism measures. The statement comes as governments step up their efforts to combat terrorism, with the UK passing emergency legislation allowing the detention of suspects without trial, and the US hinting at expanding the war on terrorism to Iraq. The organisations urged governments to strike a balance between national security concerns and the upholding of fundamental freedoms, such as the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They emphasised the importance of avoiding excessive measures that violate international law and undermine human rights. The statement was a response to worrying developments, including the recent killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan and the erosion of civil liberties in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Mary Robinson, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been a critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in this context. The organisations called for restraint and a commitment to international obligations to uphold human rights in the fight against terrorism.
