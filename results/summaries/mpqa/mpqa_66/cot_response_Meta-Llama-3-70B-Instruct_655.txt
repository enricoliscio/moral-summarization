SUMMARY:
Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not lead to the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries following the September 11 attacks, where governments have taken "excessive steps" that undermine "fundamental freedoms" and "legitimate dissent". The organizations emphasized that it is "essential" for states to uphold human rights and "fundamental freedoms" in the fight against terrorism, and to strike a balance between "legitimate national security concerns" and human rights. They also urged that certain rights, such as the right to life, freedom of expression, and freedom from torture, should not be compromised. END OF SUMMARY.
