SUMMARY: The Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for the violation of human rights. They are responding to worrying developments in some countries, where measures to combat terrorism are undermining fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations urge governments to uphold human rights and freedoms, even in the face of terrorism, and to avoid excessive steps that would violate these rights. The war on terrorism is taking a heavy toll on civil liberties, and recent events, such as the detention of terrorist suspects without trial and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates, are cause for concern. The organizations emphasize the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and of avoiding the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes. They call for restraint in the military campaign and for an inquiry into the recent killings in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
