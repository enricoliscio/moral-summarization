SUMMARY: The Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries following the September 11 attacks, where measures taken to combat terrorism have led to human rights abuses. The organizations urged governments to refrain from excessive steps that would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent, and to uphold human rights and freedoms in the fight against terrorism. They emphasized the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fundamental freedoms, and listed essential rights that cannot be compromised, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. The statement comes amid concerns over recent developments, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK allowing detention without trial, and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan.
