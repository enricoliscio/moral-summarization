Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about three international organizations warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't violate human rights. They mentioned the Council of Europe, OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. They're responding to recent developments after 9/11.

Hmm, the key points are that while terrorism is a threat, governments shouldn't overstep and violate fundamental freedoms. They want states to stick to their international obligations. Mary Robinson is highlighted as a critical voice, pointing out the impact on civil liberties. The article also mentions specific events like the UK passing emergency legislation and the prison incident in Afghanistan. Amnesty International called for an inquiry there.

I should include that the organizations emphasize balancing national security with human rights. They list essential rights like the right to life, freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. Also, they oppose retroactive severe penalties. The US considering expanding the war to Iraq is another point, with criticism from Germany and France.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements. I'll structure it by first stating the organizations and their warning, then mention the context of 9/11 and recent developments. Highlight the call for balance, list the rights, and note the UK legislation and the US's potential next steps. Keep it clear and to the point without getting too detailed.
