SUMMARY: 

Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have jointly warned that the fight against terrorism should not be used as a pretext for the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries following the September 11 attacks, where governments are taking excessive measures that undermine fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent. The organizations emphasized the need for governments to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, even in the face of terrorism, and to strike a balance between national security concerns and individual freedoms. They highlighted the importance of protecting essential rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture, and avoiding retroactive penalties. The warning comes as countries like the UK have passed emergency legislation allowing detention without trial, and as the US considers expanding its war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.
