SUMMARY:
Three leading international organizations, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned that the fight against terrorism should not lead to the violation of human rights. They expressed concern over "worrying developments" in some countries, where governments are taking "excessive steps" that undermine "fundamental freedoms" and "legitimate dissent". The organizations emphasized that it is "essential" for states to uphold human rights and "strictly adhere" to their international obligations. They highlighted the importance of striking a balance between "legitimate national security concerns" and "fundamental freedoms". The statement comes amid concerns over recent events, including the passage of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan. The organizations urged governments to avoid "hollowing out" essential rights, such as the right to life and freedom from torture. END OF SUMMARY.
