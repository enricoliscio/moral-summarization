Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about three international organizations warning against using the fight against terrorism as a reason to violate human rights. They mentioned the Council of Europe, OSCE, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. They're responding to developments after 9/11, so that's the context.

The main points are that while terrorism requires specific measures, governments shouldn't take excessive steps that violate freedoms. They emphasize adhering to international obligations. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner, is particularly critical, saying the war on terror is harming civil liberties. 

The article also mentions recent events: the UK passing emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the tragic killings in Afghanistan, prompting Amnesty International to call for an inquiry. The organizations stress the balance between security and freedoms, listing essential rights like life, expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also warn against retroactive penalties. Additionally, the US considering expanding the war to Iraq drew criticism from Germany and France.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the joint warning, mention the organizations, the context post-9/11, the call for adherence to human rights, the examples of UK legislation and Afghanistan, and the essential rights. I'll end with the US's potential expansion and the criticism. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.
