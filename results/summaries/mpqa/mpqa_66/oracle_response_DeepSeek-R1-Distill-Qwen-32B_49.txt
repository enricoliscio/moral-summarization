Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should follow the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about three international organizations warning that the fight against terrorism shouldn't lead to human rights violations. They mention recent developments post-9/11, the need for governments to avoid excessive measures, and the importance of upholding fundamental freedoms. They also reference specific events like the British legislation and the prison killings in Afghanistan, calling for an inquiry. The organizations emphasize balancing security with rights and list essential rights that shouldn't be compromised.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning the three organizations and their warning. I'll include the morally framed words like "violation," "terrorism," "excessive measures," "fundamental freedoms," "uphold," "abuses," "toll," "trial," "killings," "inquiry," "strike," "freedoms," "hollowed," "torture," "avoided," and "restraint."

I should structure it to first state the organizations' warning, then the context of recent events, their call for balance, the specific rights they mention, and the criticism towards the US's potential expansion of the war. I need to keep it concise, so I'll make sure each sentence covers a key point without going into too much detail.

Let me draft it step by step:

1. Mention the three organizations and their joint warning against using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for human rights violations.
2. Reference the recent worrying developments post-9/11 and the call to avoid excessive measures.
3. Include the specific examples like the British legislation and the prison killings, and the call for an inquiry.
4. Highlight the essential rights that shouldn't be compromised.
5. Conclude with the criticism of the US's potential expansion and the call for restraint.

I need to make sure I use the morally framed words naturally within the summary. Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words. 

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's clear and concise while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Three international organizations—the Council of Europe, OSCE, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights—warned that the fight against terrorism must not violate human rights. They criticized recent developments, such as Britain's emergency legislation allowing detention without trial and the killings of Taliban inmates in Afghanistan, calling for an inquiry. The groups emphasized the need to balance national security with fundamental freedoms, urging governments to avoid excessive measures that could undermine rights like freedom of expression, religion, and freedom from torture. They also warned against retroactive penalties and highlighted the importance of adhering to international law commitments. The organizations condemned potential military expansion beyond Afghanistan, urging restraint to prevent human rights abuses and ensure civil liberties are not hollowed out in the war on terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
