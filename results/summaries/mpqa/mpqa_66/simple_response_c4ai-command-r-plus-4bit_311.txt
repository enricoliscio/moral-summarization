SUMMARY: In a joint statement, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned against violating human rights in the name of counterterrorism. The statement comes in response to recent events, such as the passing of emergency legislation in the UK and the killing of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, that raise concerns about the potential erosion of fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism. The organizations emphasize the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and the upholding of human rights, specifically highlighting the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. They urge governments to refrain from excessive measures that would violate these rights and to avoid retroactive imposition of more severe penalties. The statement serves as a reminder that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within a moral framework that respects and protects the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals. It underscores the importance of international cooperation and adherence to international law in addressing global challenges while upholding universal human rights standards. END OF SUMMARY.
