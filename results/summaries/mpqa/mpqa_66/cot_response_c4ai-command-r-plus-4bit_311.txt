SUMMARY: Three prominent international organizations have issued a joint warning that the fight against terrorism should not come at the expense of human rights. The statement comes in response to recent and worrying developments, where some countries have taken excessive steps that threaten fundamental freedoms and legitimate dissent in the name of national security. 

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has been particularly vocal about the toll the war on terrorism is taking on civil liberties. She, along with representatives from the Council of Europe and the OSCE, have urged governments to find a balance between legitimate national security concerns and the fundamental freedoms and rights that are essential to uphold, even in times of crisis. 

The statement highlights several essential rights that must be preserved, including the right to life, freedom of expression and religion, and freedom from torture. It also warns against the retroactive imposition of harsher penalties for crimes and calls for restraint in the expansion of military campaigns beyond their original scope. 

The organizations acknowledge the need for specific measures to combat terrorism, but stress that these measures must not violate international obligations to respect human rights. The statement comes amid concerns about the British government's emergency legislation and the recent killings of Taliban inmates, both of which have raised difficult questions about the ethical boundaries of counter-terrorism strategies.
