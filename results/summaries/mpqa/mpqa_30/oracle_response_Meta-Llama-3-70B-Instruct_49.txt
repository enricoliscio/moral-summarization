SUMMARY:

Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the March election, as a punishment and part of a larger campaign of retribution against his supporters. Tsvangirai alleges that a starvation policy is being waged against his supporters, with the government targeting farmers, rural-area sympathizers, and opposition strongholds. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to have a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns the government's land-reform plan, which he claims is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime and urges Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom.
