SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleged that this starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted first. 

Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. In some cases, people have had to denounce the MDC and go through a "cleansing" routine before being allowed to purchase corn. 

Tsvangirai also criticized the land-reform plan, saying it is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites rather than resettling poor families. He commended countries like Canada for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom. He cautioned against reckless action and called for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen victory and illegitimate government.

END OF SUMMARY.
