SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, including violence, hunger, and economic turmoil. He claims that the ruling party is using the land-reform plan to benefit themselves and their cronies rather than resettle poor families. Tsvangirai commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. He also mentions his own legal battle with the government, facing treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. Tsvangirai denies the charges and questions the reliability of the prosecution's key witness. He believes that a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront the stolen victory and illegitimate government.
END OF SUMMARY.
