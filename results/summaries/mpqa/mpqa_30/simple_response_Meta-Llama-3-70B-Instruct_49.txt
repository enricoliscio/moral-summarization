SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him in the March election, as part of a campaign of retribution against his supporters. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's government is using starvation as a weapon to crush the opposition, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition is strongest. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's regime, saying that the land-reform plan is actually enriching presidential cronies and ruling party elites. He commends Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions and urges Zimbabweans to peacefully fight for their freedom.
