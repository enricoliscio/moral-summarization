SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution waged by the ruling ZANU-PF, which has also involved violence and economic upheaval. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition support is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted first. 

The United Nations World Food Program has warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have also reported discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. 

Mr. Tsvangirai commended countries like Canada for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime, but he believes that ultimately, Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom. He cautioned, however, that a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront the illegitimate government.
