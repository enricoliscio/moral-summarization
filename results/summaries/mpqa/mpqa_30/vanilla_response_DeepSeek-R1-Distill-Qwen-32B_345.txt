Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, so I should focus on the main points.

First, I'll read through the article to identify key elements: Tsvangirai's accusations, the context of the election, the drought, food distribution issues, Mugabe's response, and the involvement of international organizations.

I should mention Tsvangirai's claims about food being used as a tool for retribution against his supporters. Also, note the UN's warning about starvation and the discrimination in food distribution requiring ZANU-PF membership.

Include Mugabe's acknowledgment of agricultural issues but not the impact of farm invasions. Highlight the land reform being used to benefit Mugabe's cronies. Also, touch on Tsvangirai's trial and his call for peaceful change.

Make sure the summary flows logically, covering all these points succinctly without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the accusation, then the drought and food issues, Mugabe's stance, the UN's warning, the discrimination, land reform, and Tsvangirai's comments on the trial and the need for Zimbabweans to lead the change.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused President Robert Mugabe of using food shortages as a tool to punish areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai claimed the ruling ZANU-PF party is targeting his supporters through a "starvation policy," with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe. The UN warned that 1.5 million people face starvation due to drought and government-backed farm invasions, which have disrupted food production. Non-governmental organizations reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF membership to access supplies. Tsvangirai also criticized Mugabe's land-reform program, which he said benefits Mugabe's cronies rather than the poor. He commended international sanctions but emphasized that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. Tsvangirai denied treason charges, questioning the prosecution's case as his trial approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
