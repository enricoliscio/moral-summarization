SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, is waging a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, including violence and hunger. He says the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition is strongest, and that farmers and their workers are the first targets. The United Nations World Food Program warns that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms. Tsvangirai also alleges that the land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but says Zimbabwe's future rests with its people. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai faces his own legal battle, as he is set to stand trial on treason charges, which he denies.
