Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, so I need to identify the morally charged words first. Let me read through the article again.

The key points are Tsvangirai's accusations of Mugabe using starvation as retribution, targeting opposition supporters, especially in southern Zimbabwe. The UN WFP mentions 1.5 million facing starvation due to drought and government actions. NGOs like Amani Trust report discrimination in food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF cards. Mugabe's land reform is criticized for benefiting cronies, not the poor. Tsvangirai also talks about his trial on treason charges, involving a witness from Canada.

Now, the morally framed words I can spot are: starvation, retribution, vendetta, escalate, target, strongest opposition, farmers, workers, rural-area sympathizers, starvation, drought, sabotage, restrictions, discriminatory, Staple diet, starvation, compulsory, denounce, confession, observation, allowed, grain, land-reform plan, cronies, elite, illegitimate government, sanctions, repression, struggle, casualties, reckless action, systematic, strategic, mass mobilization, stolen victory, illegal, trial, treason, assassinate, reluctant, prosecution, case.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these as possible without losing the moral essence. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the key accusations and the moral issues involved.

Let me structure it: Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of using starvation as punishment, targeting opposition supporters. UN and NGOs report discrimination in food distribution. Mugabe's land reforms benefit cronies. Tsvangirai mentions international support but emphasizes Zimbabweans' role. He faces treason charges, questioning the prosecution's case.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. Maybe start with the accusation, then the effects, the UN and NGOs' findings, the land reforms, his stance on international vs. local efforts, and end with his legal situation.

Let me draft that, keeping an eye on the word count. Make sure each sentence is clear and includes the moral framing words where appropriate. Avoid any markdown, just plain text as per the user's request.
