SUMMARY:
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him, as part of a "vendetta" against his supporters. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's regime is orchestrating a "starvation policy" to crush the opposition, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition is strongest. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of "discriminatory food distribution," where people are forced to have a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy food. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's land-reform plan is actually enriching presidential cronies and ruling party elite, calling it "ZANU-PF's final feast." He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's "illegitimate" government, but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom.
