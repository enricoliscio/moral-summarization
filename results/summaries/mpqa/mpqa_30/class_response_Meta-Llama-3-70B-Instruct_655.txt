SUMMARY:

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is accused of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as part of a campaign of retribution against the opposition. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is engaging in a starvation policy, targeting farmers, workers, and rural-area sympathizers who support the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's land-reform plan is actually a means of enriching presidential cronies and ruling party elites. The government's discriminatory food distribution has been reported by non-governmental organizations, with cases of people being forced to denounce the MDC and undergo a "cleansing" routine to access food. Tsvangirai calls for peaceful mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government and fight for freedom.
