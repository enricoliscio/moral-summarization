SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, including violence, hunger, and economic turmoil. He claims that the ruling party is engaging in discriminatory food distribution, requiring people to have a ZANU-PF card or denounce the MDC before being allowed to buy corn. Tsvangirai also criticizes the land-reform plan, saying it is benefiting presidential cronies and the ruling party elite rather than resettling poor families. He commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. Tsvangirai faces his own legal battle, with a treason trial scheduled for May 31, which he denies.
