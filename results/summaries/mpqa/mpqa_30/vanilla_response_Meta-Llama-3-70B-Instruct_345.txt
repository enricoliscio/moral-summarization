SUMMARY:

Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the March election, as part of a campaign of retribution against his supporters. Tsvangirai alleges that the government is deliberately starving people in areas that strongly oppose the ruling ZANU-PF party, particularly in southern Zimbabwe. The UN World Food Program has warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have also reported cases of discriminatory food distribution, where people are required to have a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy food. Tsvangirai also criticized the government's land-reform plan, saying it benefits presidential cronies and ruling party elite. He commended Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions on the regime and called on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom.
