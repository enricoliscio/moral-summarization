SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe is using a "starvation policy" as part of a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters. He claims that the government is targeting farmers and rural-area sympathizers, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition to Mugabe's party is strongest. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai also criticized Mugabe's land-reform plan, saying it is benefiting presidential cronies and ruling party elite rather than poor families. He commended Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions on Mugabe's regime and called on Zimbabweans to peacefully fight for their freedom.
