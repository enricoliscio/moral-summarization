SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-affected areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He also discusses the support the opposition has received from abroad and his upcoming treason trial. The United Nations World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai alleges that the land-reform program is benefiting presidential cronies and ruling party elites. He commends international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. Tsvangirai also mentions his treason trial, where the prosecution's key witness, Ari Ben-Menashe, may not testify.

END OF SUMMARY.
