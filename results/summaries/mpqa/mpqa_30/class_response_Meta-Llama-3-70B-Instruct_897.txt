SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as retribution for not voting for him in the March election. Tsvangirai alleges a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, aimed at crushing the opposition. He claims the situation has escalated wildly since the election, with the worst affected areas being those with strong opposition to ZANU-PF. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to denounce the MDC and undergo a "cleansing" routine before being allowed to buy corn. Tsvangirai condemns the government's actions as a vendetta, stating that the international community can only support Zimbabweans so far, and that the burden lies with them to fight peacefully for their own freedom.
