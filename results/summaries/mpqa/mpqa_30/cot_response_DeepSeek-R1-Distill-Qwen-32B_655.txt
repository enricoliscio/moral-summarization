Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally charged words as per the user's instructions. Let me read through the article again to spot those words.

The article talks about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. Words like "withholding," "punishment," "starvation policy," "retribution," "vendetta," "violence," "hunger," "controversial election," "state-orchestrated," "crushing the opposition," "discriminatory food distribution," "sabotage," "economic upheaval," "cronies," "illegitimate government," "treason," "assassination," "sanctions," "repression," "freedom," "violence," "turmoil," "change," and "mass mobilization" stand out as morally framed terms.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and highlight the moral issues Tsvangirai is pointing out. I'll structure it by addressing the accusations, the impact on the population, the government's response, and the international context.

I'll start by mentioning Tsvangirai's accusations against Mugabe, then discuss the starvation policy and discrimination. I'll include the UN's warning and the government's denial. Next, I'll touch on the land reform issues and Mugabe's cronies. Finally, I'll mention the treason charges and Tsvangirai's call for peaceful change.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included appropriately.

**SUMMARY:**
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not supporting him in the March election. Tsvangirai claims this is part of a starvation policy aimed at retribution against his supporters, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe. The UN warns that 1.5 million face starvation due to drought and government actions, including land invasions that disrupted agriculture. Tsvangirai alleges that food distribution is discriminatory, requiring ZANU-PF loyalty. He also criticizes Mugabe's cronies benefiting from land reforms. Tsvangirai commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans' responsibility for change. He faces treason charges, denying assassination plots. The situation highlights the need for peaceful, systematic action against Mugabe's regime. END OF SUMMARY.
