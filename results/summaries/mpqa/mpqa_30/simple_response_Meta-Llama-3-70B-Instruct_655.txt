SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment. Tsvangirai alleges that the government is waging a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, using starvation as a weapon. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to the ruling party is strongest. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies in order to receive food. Tsvangirai condemns the government's actions as a "vendetta" and a "grand strategy" to crush the opposition.
