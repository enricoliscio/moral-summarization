SUMMARY:

Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the March election, as part of a campaign of retribution against the opposition. Tsvangirai alleges that the government is deliberately starving people in areas that support the opposition, particularly in southern Zimbabwe. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai also criticized the government's land-reform plan, saying it benefits presidential cronies and ruling party elite. He commended Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions on the regime and urged Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom.
