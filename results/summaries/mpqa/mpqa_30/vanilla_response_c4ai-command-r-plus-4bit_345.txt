SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He also speaks about the support the opposition has received from abroad and his pending trial on treason charges. The United Nations World Food Program warns that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai alleges that the land-reform program is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. He commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future rests with its own people. He calls for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen election victory and illegitimate government. Tsvangirai also mentions his treason trial, where the prosecution's key witness, Ari Ben-Menashe, may not testify.
