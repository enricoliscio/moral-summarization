SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for the ruling party in the March election. Tsvangirai alleges that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution against him and his supporters. He claims that the government is targeting farmers and rural-area sympathizers, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest. Non-governmental organizations operating in the country have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, where people are required to have a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn. Tsvangirai condemns the government's actions as a "vendetta" and a "state-orchestrated operation" aimed at crushing the opposition. He calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom and commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime. END OF SUMMARY.
