Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. I should focus on the key points: the accusation of starvation as retribution, the targeting of MDC supporters, the UN's warning about starvation, and the discrimination in food distribution. Also, mention the land reforms benefiting Mugabe's cronies and Tsvangirai's trial. I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral stance against Mugabe's actions. Let me structure this concisely, highlighting the main allegations and their implications.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of using food withholding as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election, calling it a "starvation policy" targeting his supporters. The UN warns 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government actions disrupting agriculture. NGOs report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF loyalty to access supplies. Tsvangirai also criticizes Mugabe's land reforms, which have enriched cronies and party elites, calling it a "final feast" of exploitation. He commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans' responsibility to fight for freedom. Tsvangirai denies treason charges, questioning the prosecution's reluctance to bring key witnesses to trial. END OF SUMMARY.
