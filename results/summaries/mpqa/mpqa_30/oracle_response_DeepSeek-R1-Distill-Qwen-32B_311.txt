Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not supporting his party. There are allegations of a starvation policy, retribution, and targeting opposition supporters. The UN has warned about starvation, and there's evidence of discriminatory food distribution. Mugabe's land reforms are criticized for benefiting his cronies, leading to economic turmoil. Tsvangirai is facing treason charges and believes change must come from within Zimbabwe.

Next, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the author's list that are present in the article: withholding, punishment, policy, retribution, violence, hunger, operation, crushing, target, warned, starvation, invasions, crippled, distribution, purge, denounce, confession, repression, turmoil, sanctions, confrontation, victory.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral implications are clear. I'll mention Tsvangirai's accusations, the UN's warning, the discriminatory practices, the land reforms benefiting Mugabe's allies, and the call for Zimbabweans to lead the change. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words.

I'll start by stating Tsvangirai's accusations, then move to the UN's warning, the targeting of opposition supporters, the land reforms, and conclude with the need for Zimbabweans to drive change. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it too verbose.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures all the key points and uses the morally framed words appropriately, maintaining the original article's tone and message.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election,称这是ZANU-PF的报复行动。Tsvangirai称，Mugabe的政府正在实施一项饥饿政策，以镇压反对派支持者，南部地区情况最为严重。联合国警告，150万 Zimbabweans面临 starvation due to drought and government-backed farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Tsvangirai alleged that food distribution is discriminatory, with some requiring ZANU-PF cards or undergoing a "cleansing" process to denounce the MDC before accessing grain. Mugabe's land-reform program, ostensibly for resettlement, has put farms into the hands of his cronies. Tsvangirai condemned the regime's actions, calling for Zimbabweans to lead the struggle for change, despite international sanctions. He also faced treason charges, denying accusations of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. The situation, marked by violence, hunger, and economic turmoil, highlights the need for a peaceful, strategic campaign to confront Mugabe's illegitimate rule. END OF SUMMARY.
