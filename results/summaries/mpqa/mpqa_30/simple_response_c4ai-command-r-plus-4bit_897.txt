SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters, which includes violence, hunger, and economic turmoil. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted first. Non-governmental organizations operating in the country have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans themselves must fight peacefully for their freedom. He cautions against reckless action and calls for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen election victory and illegitimate government. He also faces his own legal battle, with a trial on treason charges set for May 31, which he denies.
