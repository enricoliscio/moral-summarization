SUMMARY:
Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's opposition party, has accused President Robert Mugabe of deliberately starving certain areas of the drought-stricken country as retribution for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, has waged a campaign of crushing the opposition through violence, hunger, and discriminatory food distribution. He claims that supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) are being denied food aid and are being forced to denounce the MDC and confess their sympathies to ZANU-PF. The situation has been exacerbated by government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, crippling food production and causing economic turmoil. Mr. Tsvangirai also alleges that the land reform program is putting commercial farms into the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling elite, rather than resettling poor families as intended. He commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom and confront the illegitimate government. Mr. Tsvangirai himself faces treason charges, which he denies, and cautions against reckless action in the struggle for change, advocating instead for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to challenge the stolen victory.
