SUMMARY:
Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him, as part of a "vendetta" against his supporters. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's regime is using "starvation" as a "punishment" for not voting correctly, and that the government is engaging in a campaign of "retribution" against the opposition. The situation is worsened by the drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of "discriminatory" food distribution, with people being forced to undergo a "cleansing" routine to purge them of their opposition sympathies. Tsvangirai calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom, saying that the international community can only do so much to support them. He vows to continue his fight against the "illegitimate" government, which he claims has "stolen" the election victory. END OF SUMMARY.
