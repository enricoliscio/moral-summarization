SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, including violence, hunger, and economic turmoil. He claims the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted first. 

Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain or go through a "cleansing" routine to purge their MDC sympathies. Tsvangirai also alleges that the land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites, rather than resettling poor families. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future rests with its own people, who must fight peacefully for their freedom. He cautions against reckless action, advocating for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen election and illegitimate government. 

END OF SUMMARY.
