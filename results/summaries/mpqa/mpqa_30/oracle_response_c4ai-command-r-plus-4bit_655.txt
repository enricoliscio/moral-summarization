SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-stricken areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He also highlights the violence, hunger, and economic turmoil that have plagued Zimbabweans since the election, allegedly as part of a state-orchestrated operation to crush the opposition. The United Nations World Food Program warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai commended countries like Canada for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans themselves must fight peacefully for their freedom. He cautioned against reckless action, calling for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai himself faces treason charges, which he denies.
