Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I should focus on the main points without getting too bogged down in details.

First, Tsvangirai is the opposition leader, and he's accusing Mugabe of using food as a weapon. That's a strong moral statement, so I need to highlight that. The article mentions drought and food shortages, but Tsvangirai is saying it's deliberate, part of a retribution campaign against his supporters. That's the key moral angle here.

I should also note the UN's warning about 1.5 million facing starvation. That adds context about the severity. Then, the article talks about the Grain Marketing Board requiring ZANU-PF cards for food, which is another moral issueâ€”discrimination based on political affiliation.

The land reform program is another point. Tsvangirai says it's not about helping the poor but giving land to Mugabe's cronies. That's a misuse of resources and another moral failing.

I need to include Tsvangirai's call for Zimbabweans to lead the change, emphasizing that international help is supportive but not sufficient. Also, his upcoming treason trial is a point to mention briefly, as it's part of the political conflict.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Tsvangirai's accusation, mention the drought and food crisis, talk about the discrimination in food distribution, the land issue, and conclude with his call to action and the trial. Make sure each point flows logically and highlights the moral aspects as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of using food shortages as a punitive tool against his supporters, particularly in drought-affected areas. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party is orchestrating a campaign of retribution, targeting farmers, workers, and rural sympathizers of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The UN warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-backed farm invasions, which have disrupted agricultural production. Tsvangirai claims that food distribution is now tied to political loyalty, with some requiring ZANU-PF membership to access supplies. He also criticizes Mugabe's land-reform program, stating it benefits cronies and elites rather than the poor. Tsvangirai calls for Zimbabweans to lead the fight for change, emphasizing that international support cannot alone remove repression. He denies treason charges, questioning the credibility of the prosecution's key witness. END OF SUMMARY.
