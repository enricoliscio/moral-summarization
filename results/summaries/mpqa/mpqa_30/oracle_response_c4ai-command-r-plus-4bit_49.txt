SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-ravaged areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution waged by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. The United Nations World Food Program has warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have also reported discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Mr. Tsvangirai commended countries like Canada for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime, but believes that ultimately, Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom. He cautioned against reckless action, calling for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government. Mr. Tsvangirai himself faces treason charges, which he denies, and he questioned the prosecution's case, given the reluctance of their key witness to testify. END OF SUMMARY.
