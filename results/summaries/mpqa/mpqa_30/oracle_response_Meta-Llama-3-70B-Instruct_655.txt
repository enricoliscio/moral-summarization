SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment and retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that the government's starvation policy is part of a larger campaign to crush the opposition, targeting farmers, workers, and sympathizers. The situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to Mugabe's ZANU-PF party is strongest. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people forced to obtain ZANU-PF cards or undergo "cleansing" routines to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns the government's land-reform plan, which he says benefits Mugabe's cronies and elite. He calls for peaceful mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government and urges the international community to support Zimbabwe's struggle for freedom.
