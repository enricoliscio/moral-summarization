Okay, I need to summarize the given news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing as the author presented it. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's government is using starvation as a tool against his supporters. There's mention of drought and the impact on food production, but Tsvangirai links it to political retribution. The UN has warned about starvation, and NGOs have reported discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF membership to access food.

I should highlight the moral issues here: using food as a weapon, political repression, and the targeting of opposition supporters. The summary needs to capture Tsvangirai's accusations, the UN's warning, and the evidence from NGOs. Also, mention the land reform being used to benefit Mugabe's cronies and the treason charges against Tsvangirai.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral stance against Mugabe's actions. I'll structure it to first state the accusation, then the consequences, and finally the call for Zimbabweans to take action. Make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of using food withholding as a punitive measure against areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai claims this is part of a broader campaign of retribution by Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, targeting his supporters. The UN warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-backed farm invasions, which have disrupted food production. NGOs report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF membership for access. Tsvangirai also alleges that Mugabe's land-reform program benefits his cronies and elite, not the poor. He condemns Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for change. Tsvangirai denies treason charges, questioning the prosecution's reliance on a reluctant witness. The situation highlights Mugabe's alleged use of hunger and violence to crush dissent, with Zimbabweans facing escalating repression.  
END OF SUMMARY.
