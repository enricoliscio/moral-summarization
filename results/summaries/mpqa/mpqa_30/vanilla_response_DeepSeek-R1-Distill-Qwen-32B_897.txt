Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, accusing President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not voting for him in the March election. He claims this is part of a retribution campaign against his supporters. The UN has warned about starvation due to drought and government actions against commercial farms. Mugabe has acknowledged the agricultural crisis but hasn't mentioned the impact of farm invasions. There's also mention of discriminatory food distribution, where people need ZANU-PF cards to buy grain. Tsvangirai talks about the land reform being used to benefit Mugabe's cronies and the elite. He also mentions his own trial on treason charges, involving a witness from Montreal. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by highlighting Tsvangirai's accusations, the UN's warning, Mugabe's response, the food distribution issue, the land reform misuse, and his legal situation. I should keep it clear and straightforward, making sure each main point is covered succinctly.
