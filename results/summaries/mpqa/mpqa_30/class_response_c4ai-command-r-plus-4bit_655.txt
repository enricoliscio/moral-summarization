SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-affected areas as retribution for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleged that Mugabe's regime is waging a campaign of crushing the opposition through hunger and violence. The United Nations warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned farms. Non-governmental organizations reported discriminatory food distribution, requiring people to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai also claimed that Mugabe's land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of his cronies and party elites. He commended international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai faces treason charges, which he denied, and he questioned the reliability of the prosecution's key witness.
END OF SUMMARY.
