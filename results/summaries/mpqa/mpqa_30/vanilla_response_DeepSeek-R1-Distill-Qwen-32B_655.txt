Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the main accusation is that Mugabe is using food as a tool to punish areas that didn't support him in the election. Tsvangirai mentions this is part of a retribution campaign. I should note that the UN has warned about starvation due to drought and the government's farm invasions, which have hurt food production.

Also, there's the issue of discriminatory food distribution, where people need ZANU-PF cards or undergo a cleansing process to get food. This is supported by NGOs like Amani Trust. Mugabe's land reform is criticized for benefiting his cronies instead of the poor.

Tsvangirai talks about the situation in southern Zimbabwe being the worst and mentions the upcoming trial on treason charges, doubting the prosecution's case without key witnesses. He emphasizes that Zimbabweans must lead the change, with international support only so much.

I need to structure this into a coherent summary, making sure each key point is covered succinctly. Keep it under 200 words, use clear language, and end with the required tokens.
