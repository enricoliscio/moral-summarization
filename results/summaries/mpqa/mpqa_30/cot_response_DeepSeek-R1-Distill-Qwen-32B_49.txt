Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral weight, like "withholding," "punishment," "retribution," etc. 

Next, I have to summarize the article, making sure to include those moral terms. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the key points: the accusations, the impact on people, the role of the government, and the international response. I should also mention the legal issues and Mugabe's denial.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the original article's moral stance without adding my own opinions. I'll structure it by first stating Tsvangirai's accusations, then the effects on Zimbabweans, the UN's warning, the government's response, the discrimination in food distribution, the land reforms, and finally Tsvangirai's comments on international support and his trial.

I should also make sure to include terms like "starvation policy," "vendetta," "discriminatory," "repression," and "illegitimate government" to preserve the moral framing. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed, maybe combining some points to stay within the limit.

Alright, I think I have a clear plan. I'll start by listing all the morally framed words, then craft a summary that weaves them in naturally, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai claimed this was part of a "starvation policy" and "vendetta" against his supporters, particularly in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to Mugabe's ZANU-PF party is strongest. The UN warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have disrupted maize and wheat production. Tsvangirai alleged that food distribution is discriminatory, with some requiring ZANU-PF loyalty to access supplies. He also criticized Mugabe's land-reform program, which he said benefits cronies and elites, calling it a "final feast" of exploitation. Tsvangirai commended international sanctions but emphasized that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. He denied treason charges, questioning the prosecution's reliance on a reluctant witness. The situation highlights Mugabe's oppressive tactics and the growing demand for change in Zimbabwe.
