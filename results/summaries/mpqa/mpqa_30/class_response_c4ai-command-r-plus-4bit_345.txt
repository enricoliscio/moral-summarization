SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-hit areas as retribution for not voting for him in the election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleged that this starvation policy is part of a larger campaign of state-orchestrated violence and repression against him and his supporters. He claimed that the situation has escalated, with ZANU-PF targeting farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers, and that food distribution is being used as a tool to discriminate against opposition supporters. Mr. Tsvangirai also criticized the land-reform program, stating that it is benefiting presidential cronies and members of the ruling elite rather than resettling poor families. He commended international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. Meanwhile, Mr. Tsvangirai faces treason charges, which he denies, and the prosecution's key witness may not testify.

END OF SUMMARY.
