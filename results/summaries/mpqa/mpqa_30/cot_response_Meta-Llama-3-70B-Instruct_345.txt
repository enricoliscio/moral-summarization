SUMMARY:
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him, as a form of punishment and retribution. This "starvation policy" is part of a larger campaign of violence and hunger aimed at crushing the opposition. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's government is deliberately targeting farmers and rural-area sympathizers, and that food is being distributed discriminatorily, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies in order to receive aid. The situation is worsened by the government's land-reform plan, which is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elite. Tsvangirai commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime, but emphasizes that the burden lies with Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom.
