SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-ravaged areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution waged by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He claims that the government is targeting farmers and their workers, as well as rural sympathizers, and that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest. 

Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. In some cases, people have been forced to denounce the MDC and confess their sympathies to the ruling party before being allowed to purchase corn. 

Mr. Tsvangirai also alleges that the government's land-reform plan is putting commercial farms into the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling elite, rather than resettling poor families as intended. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans themselves must fight peacefully for their freedom. He cautions against reckless action, calling for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen victory and illegitimate government. 

Mr. Tsvangirai himself faces treason charges, which he denies, and he questions the prosecution's case, given the reluctance of their key witness to testify.
