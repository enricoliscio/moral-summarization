SUMMARY:
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that didn't vote for him as a form of punishment and retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's regime is waging a campaign of sabotage against the opposition, targeting farmers and their workers, as well as rural-area sympathizers. The situation has escalated wildly since the election, with 1.5 million Zimbabweans facing starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to undergo a "cleansing" routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn. Tsvangirai commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime, but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future rests with its own people fighting peacefully for their freedom from the shackles of repression.
