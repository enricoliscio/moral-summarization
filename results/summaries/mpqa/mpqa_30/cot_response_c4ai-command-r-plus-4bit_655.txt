SUMMARY:
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai *accuses* President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-hit areas as *revenge* for not voting for him in the *controversial* March election. Mr. Tsvangirai *alleges* that this is part of a broader campaign of *retribution* by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters, including *violence*, *invasion* of white-owned commercial farms, and discriminatory food distribution. He asserts that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition is strongest, with farmers and their workers being the *first* *survivors*. Non-governmental organizations corroborate these claims, reporting instances where people were required to possess a ZANU-PF card or publicly *denounce* the MDC before being allowed to purchase grain. Mr. Tsvangirai commends international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future depends on its people peacefully fighting for their freedom. He also mentions his upcoming trial on *treason* charges, questioning the reliability of the prosecution's key witness.
