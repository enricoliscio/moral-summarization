SUMMARY:

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is accused of withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution against him and his supporters. The situation is dire, with 1.5 million Zimbabweans facing starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai also claims that the government's land-reform plan is actually benefiting presidential cronies and elite members. He commends Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions on Mugabe's regime, but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must take responsibility for fighting peacefully for their own freedom. Tsvangirai's own trial on treason charges is pending, with questions surrounding the prosecution's key witness.
