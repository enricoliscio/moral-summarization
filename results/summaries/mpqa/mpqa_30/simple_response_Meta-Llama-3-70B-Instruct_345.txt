SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment. Tsvangirai alleges that the government is waging a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, including a "starvation policy" that is exacerbating the country's drought-related food crisis. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation, and non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies in order to receive aid. Tsvangirai also criticizes the government's land-reform plan, which he claims is benefiting presidential cronies and ruling party elites. He commends international sanctions against the regime and calls on Zimbabweans to peacefully fight for their freedom.
