Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral terms used.

The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, accusing President Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not voting for him in the election. He talks about a starvation policy as retribution against his supporters. The moral terms here include "deliberately withholding," "retribution," "starvation policy," and "vendetta." 

The article also mentions the UN's warning about 1.5 million people facing starvation due to drought and government actions. The government is accused of invasions on white-owned farms, which have crippled production. Terms like "invasions," "crippled," and "sabotage" are used here.

There's a mention of discriminatory food distribution, where people need ZANU-PF cards to buy food. This involves "discriminatory distribution" and "cleansing" routines to denounce the MDC. 

Tsvangirai also talks about the land-reform plan benefiting Mugabe's cronies, calling it a "Last Supper" scenario. The international community's sanctions and his own trial on treason charges are mentioned, with terms like "treason," "repression," "freedom," and "illegitimate government."

I need to include as many of these moral terms as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and highlight the main accusations and the moral framing.

I'll start by stating Tsvangirai's accusation, then mention the UN warning, the discriminatory practices, the land reforms, and the international response. I'll also touch on the trial and the call for peaceful change.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of deliberately withholding food as punishment.
2. UN warning about starvation due to drought and government actions.
3. Discriminatory distribution requiring ZANU-PF cards and cleansing routines.
4. Land reforms benefiting Mugabe's cronies, termed as "Last Supper."
5. International sanctions and the call for Zimbabweans to fight for freedom.
6. Mention of the treason trial and the need for systematic change.

I need to ensure that each of these points is covered with the appropriate moral terms. Let me draft the summary accordingly, keeping it within the word limit and preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food to punish areas that opposed him in the March election, part of a retribution campaign. The UN warns 1.5 million face starvation due to drought and government invasions of farms, which have crippled production. Discriminatory food distribution requires ZANU-PF cards, with "cleansing" routines forcing people to denounce the MDC. Tsvangirai alleges Mugabe's cronies benefit from land reforms, calling it a "Last Supper" scenario. He commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans must fight for freedom. His treason trial, denying assassination plots, highlights repression. Tsvangirai calls for a peaceful, strategic campaign against Mugabe's illegitimate rule. END OF SUMMARY.
