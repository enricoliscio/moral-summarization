SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is using starvation as a form of punishment against his supporters. The United Nations World Food Program has warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce their opposition sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai also claims that Mugabe's land-reform plan is benefiting presidential cronies and ruling party elite, rather than poor families. He commended Canada and other countries for imposing sanctions on Mugabe's regime and called on Zimbabweans to peacefully fight for their freedom.
