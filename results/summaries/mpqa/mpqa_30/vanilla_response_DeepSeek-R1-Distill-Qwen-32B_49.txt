Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, accusing President Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him in the election. He mentions that this is part of a retribution campaign against him and his supporters. The UN has warned about starvation due to drought and government actions on farms. Mugabe has declared a state of disaster but blames white farmers for sabotage. There are reports of food distribution being discriminatory, requiring ZANU-PF cards. Tsvangirai also talks about land reforms benefiting Mugabe's cronies and his own trial on treason charges, questioning the prosecution's key witness.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I should include the main points: Tsvangirai's accusations, the drought and food shortage, Mugabe's response, the discrimination in food distribution, the land reforms, and Tsvangirai's trial. I should make sure to mention the UN's warning and the impact on the population. Also, include his call for peaceful change and international support.

Let me structure it: Start with Tsvangirai's accusation, then the drought and food issues, mention Mugabe's response, the discrimination, land reforms, his trial, and his message about Zimbabweans needing to take action. Keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

I think that's a good plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.
