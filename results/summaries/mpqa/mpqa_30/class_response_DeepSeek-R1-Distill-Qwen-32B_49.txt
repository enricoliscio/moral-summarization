Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and identify the morally charged words used by the author.

The article talks about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him. Key moral terms include "deliberately withholding," "retribution," "starvation policy," "state-orchestrated," "vendetta," and "discriminatory distribution." The UN and NGOs are mentioned, highlighting the severity of the situation with words like "starvation," "drought," and "economic upheaval."

I need to make sure the summary includes these terms and reflects the moral judgment against Mugabe's actions. I'll structure the summary to first state Tsvangirai's accusation, then explain the impact of the food distribution, mention Mugabe's response, and conclude with Tsvangirai's call for action.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key points are covered without losing the moral tone. Also, I need to include the parts about the land reforms and the treason charges briefly to show the broader context of Mugabe's policies.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words and maintain the critical perspective towards Mugabe's government.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-affected areas as retribution for not supporting him in the March election. Tsvangirai claims this starvation policy is part of a state-orchestrated campaign to crush opposition, targeting farmers, workers, and rural supporters. The UN warns 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Mugabe has declared a "state of disaster," blaming drought and sabotage by white farmers, but denies the impact of farm invasions. NGOs report discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF loyalty to access grain. Tsvangirai alleges Mugabe's land-reform plan benefits cronies and elite, calling it a "final feast" of repression. He commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans must fight for freedom. Tsvangirai also faces treason charges, denying accusations of plotting Mugabe's assassination. The situation, he says, is escalating violence, hunger, and economic turmoil, strengthening the appetite for change. END OF SUMMARY.
