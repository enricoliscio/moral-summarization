SUMMARY:
Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's opposition party Movement for Democratic Change, has accused President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleged that this starvation policy is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted. 

The United Nations World Food Program has warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have disrupted food production. Mr. Mugabe has acknowledged the country's agricultural problems, declaring a "state of disaster," but he failed to address the economic turmoil caused by the farm invasions. 

Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to hold a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Mr. Tsvangirai further alleges that the land reform program is simply a way for ZANU-PF members and presidential cronies to seize commercial farms for themselves. 

Mr. Tsvangirai commended foreign countries for imposing sanctions on Mr. Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabwe's future depends on its people peacefully fighting for their freedom. He also expressed caution about reckless actions, stating that a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront the illegitimate government and their stolen victory. 

Finally, Mr. Tsvangirai discussed his upcoming trial on treason charges, where he is accused of plotting to assassinate Mr. Mugabe. He questioned the prosecution's case, noting that their key witness, Ari Ben-Menashe, may be reluctant to testify.
