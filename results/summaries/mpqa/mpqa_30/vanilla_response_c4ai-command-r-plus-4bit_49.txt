SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He also speaks about the support the opposition has received from abroad and his pending trial on treason charges. The United Nations World Food Program warns that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai alleges that the land-reform program is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites. He commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but says Zimbabwe's future rests with its own people. Tsvangirai also discusses his legal battle with the government, facing treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. He questions the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on the testimony of a reluctant witness. END OF SUMMARY.
