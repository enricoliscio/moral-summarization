SUMMARY:
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has *accused* Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as *punishment* for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai claims this is part of a *vendetta* and a *campaign of retribution* by the ruling ZANU-PF party, which has *targeted* his supporters. He alleges that the situation has escalated *wildly* since the election and that the government is using *starvation* as a *policy* to *crush the opposition*. The situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where ZANU-PF *opposition* is *strongest*. Mr. Tsvangirai also *alleges* that the government's land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of *cronies* and *elite members* of the ruling party, rather than resettling poor families as intended. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Tsvangirai *commends* international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future depends on its people, who must *fight peacefully* to break the *shackles of repression*. He expresses concern about the ongoing *violence*, *hunger*, and *economic turmoil*, which are *strengthening* the people's *appetite for change*. Mr. Tsvangirai also discusses his *own legal battle* with the government, facing *treason charges* for allegedly plotting to assassinate President Mugabe. He questions the prosecution's case, relying on a *reluctant witness*.
