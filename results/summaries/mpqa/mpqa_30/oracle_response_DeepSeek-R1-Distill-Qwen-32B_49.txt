Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of using food as a tool of punishment against his supporters. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe is withholding food as retribution for voting against him. The article mentions that this is part of a strategy to target MDC supporters, especially in areas where opposition is strong. There's also mention of the UN warning about starvation and NGOs reporting discriminatory food distribution, requiring people to denounce the MDC to get food. Additionally, Mugabe's land reforms are criticized for benefiting his cronies, leading to economic turmoil. Tsvangirai talks about the need for a peaceful movement and his own trial on treason charges.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "withholding," "punishment," "policy," "retribution," "waged," "violence," "hunger," "operation," "crushing," "target," "warned," "starvation," "invasions," "crippled," "upheaval," "distribution," "allowed," "purge," "denounce," "confession," "repression," "turmoil," "change," "casualties," "action," "confront," "victory," and "case" should be included.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Mugabe's actions, the impact on the people, the role of food distribution as a tool of control, and Tsvangirai's call for a peaceful movement. I'll make sure to mention the UN warning and the NGOs' reports to add context. Also, I'll touch on the land reforms and the trial to show the broader issues.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while preserving the moral tone. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct, focusing on the key accusations and the moral implications.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai claimed this starvation policy is part of a retribution campaign by Mugabe's ruling party, targeting MDC supporters. The UN warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government invasions of commercial farms, which have crippled maize and wheat production. NGOs reported discriminatory food distribution, requiring people to denounce the MDC before accessing grain. Tsvangirai also criticized Mugabe's land-reform plan, which he said benefits cronies and elite party members, exacerbating economic turmoil. He emphasized the need for a peaceful mass movement to confront Mugabe's "stolen victory" and illegitimate government. Tsvangirai denied treason charges, questioning the prosecution's reluctance to call its key witness. The situation highlights the use of violence, hunger, and repression as tools of control, with Zimbabweans bearing the brunt of Mugabe's strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
