SUMMARY: Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted first. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai commends the international community for imposing sanctions on Mugabe's regime but believes that ultimately, Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom. He cautions against reckless action and calls for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen election victory and illegitimate government. Tsvangirai also faces his own legal battle, with a treason trial set for May 31, which he denies plotting to assassinate Mugabe.
