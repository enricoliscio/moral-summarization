I need to identify the key morally framed words used by the author. The list provided includes words like "withholding," "punishment," "policy," "retribution," "violence," "hunger," etc. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

Next, I'll structure the summary to cover the main accusations: Mugabe withholding food as punishment, the targeting of opposition supporters, the impact of land invasions on agriculture, and the international response. I should also mention the court case against Tsvangirai.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that did not support him in the March election. Tsvangirai alleges this is part of a retribution campaign by the ruling ZANU-PF party, targeting farmers, workers, and rural supporters of the opposition. The UN warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned farms, which have crippled agricultural production. Tsvangirai claims the situation has escalated since the election, with food distribution being used as a tool of repression. Non-governmental organizations report cases where people must denounce the opposition or undergo purification rituals to access food. Mugabe's land-reform plan, aimed at resettling poor families, has instead enriched his cronies and party elites. Tsvangirai commends international sanctions but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. He also faces a treason trial, denying charges of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. The article highlights the violence, hunger, and turmoil plaguing Zimbabwe under Mugabe's regime, with Tsvangirai calling for a peaceful mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government.
