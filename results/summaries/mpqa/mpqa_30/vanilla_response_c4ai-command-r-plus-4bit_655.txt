SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleges that this is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF against him and his supporters. He also highlights the support the opposition has received from abroad and discusses his pending trial on treason charges. The food crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening, with up to 1.5 million people facing starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Tsvangirai alleges that the land-reform program is benefiting presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. He commends the international community for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. He faces a trial on treason charges, with the prosecution's key witness being a former Israeli intelligence agent.
