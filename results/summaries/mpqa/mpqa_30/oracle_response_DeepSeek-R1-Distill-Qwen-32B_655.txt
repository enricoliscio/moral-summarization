Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him. There's talk of a starvation policy and retribution against his supporters. The UN warns about starvation due to drought and government actions. NGOs report discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF cards. Mugabe's land reform is benefiting his cronies, leading to economic turmoil. Tsvangirai commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans' role in change. He faces treason charges, questioning the prosecution's case.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with Tsvangirai's accusation, mention the starvation policy and retribution. Include the UN warning and the NGOs' findings on food distribution. Highlight Mugabe's cronies benefiting from land reform. Mention the economic turmoil and Tsvangirai's call for peaceful change. End with his legal situation and the need for Zimbabweans to lead the change.

I need to make sure to use words like withholding, punishment, policy, retribution, starvation, distribution, purge, confession, sanctions, repression, turmoil, change, confrontation, victory. Keep it under 200 words and in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election, describing it as part of a retribution campaign against his supporters. He alleged that the ruling ZANU-PF party is targeting farmers, workers, and rural sympathizers, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe. The UN warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. NGOs reported discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF cards or public denunciations of the MDC to access grain. Tsvangirai criticized Mugabe's land-reform plan, claiming it benefits cronies and party elites, calling it a "final feast" of corruption. He commended international sanctions but emphasized that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. Tsvangirai also faced treason charges, questioning the prosecution's case as it relies on a reluctant witness. The violence, hunger, and economic turmoil are deepening the desire for change, though he cautioned against reckless action, advocating for a peaceful, strategic campaign to confront Mugabe's illegitimate government. END OF SUMMARY.
