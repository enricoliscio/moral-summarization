SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the March election. Tsvangirai alleges that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution waged against him and his supporters. The situation has escalated wildly since the election, with the worst affected areas being in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest. The United Nations World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms that have crippled production. Non-governmental organizations operating in the country have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to denounce the MDC and undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy corn. Tsvangirai calls for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the stolen victory and illegitimate government, urging Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom.
