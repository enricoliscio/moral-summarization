SUMMARY:
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as a form of punishment for not voting for the ruling party in March's election. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is waging a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, using starvation and violence to crush the opposition. The situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to obtain a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy corn. Tsvangirai calls this a "vendetta" and a "pursuit of a vendetta" against his supporters. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime, but emphasizes that Zimbabwe's future rests with its own people fighting peacefully for their freedom from the "shackles of repression" and the "illegitimate government".
