SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-stricken areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. The United Nations World Food Program has warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Mr. Tsvangirai also alleges that the government's land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites rather than resettling poor families. He commends the international community for imposing sanctions on Mr. Mugabe's regime but believes that Zimbabweans must ultimately fight peacefully for their own freedom. He faces his own legal battle, with a trial for treason charges scheduled for May 31, which he denies.
