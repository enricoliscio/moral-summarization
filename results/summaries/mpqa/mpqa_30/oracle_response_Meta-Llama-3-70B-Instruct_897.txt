SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the March election, as a form of punishment and retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is waging a campaign of violence and hunger against his supporters, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition to the ruling ZANU-PF is strongest. The government's actions have crippled food production, leaving 1.5 million Zimbabweans facing starvation. Non-governmental organizations have reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being forced to obtain ZANU-PF cards or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's regime, accusing him of putting commercial farms in the hands of cronies and elite members. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against the regime and calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
