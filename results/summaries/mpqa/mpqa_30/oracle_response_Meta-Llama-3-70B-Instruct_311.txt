SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment and retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that the ruling party is waging a campaign of violence and hunger against his supporters, targeting farmers, workers, and rural-area sympathizers. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, where people are forced to obtain ZANU-PF cards or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns the government's land-reform plan, which he claims is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and elite members. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against the regime and calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom.
