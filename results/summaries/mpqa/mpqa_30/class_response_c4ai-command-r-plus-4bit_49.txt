SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-stricken areas as retribution for not voting for him in the election. Tsvangirai alleged that Mugabe's regime is engaging in a campaign of state-orchestrated violence, hunger, and repression against his supporters, targeting farmers and their workers in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition is strongest. He also claimed that Mugabe's land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. The United Nations World Food Program warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned farms, crippling food production. Non-governmental organizations reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, requiring people to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai faces treason charges, accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. He denied the charges and questioned the reliability of the prosecution's key witness. Tsvangirai commended international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their freedom. He called for a systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization to confront the illegitimate government.
