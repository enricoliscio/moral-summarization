Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment. I should focus on the key points: the accusation of starvation as a political tool, the impact on opposition supporters, international response, and the legal issues surrounding Tsvangirai.

First, I'll note that Tsvangirai claims Mugabe is using food as a weapon against his supporters. This is a moral issue because it's targeting vulnerable people. I should mention the drought and how Mugabe's policies have worsened the situation.

Next, the article talks about food distribution being tied to political loyalty. Organizations like Amani Trust report that people need ZANU-PF cards to access food. This is another moral point about discrimination and repression.

The land reform is another issue. Tsvangirai says it's benefiting Mugabe's cronies, which is unfair and contributes to the economic crisis. This ties into the broader repression and misuse of power.

I should also include Tsvangirai's call for peaceful resistance and the role of the international community, but emphasize that change must come from within Zimbabwe.

Finally, the treason charges against Tsvangirai and the role of the Canadian-connected witness add to the political tensions. This shows the lengths Mugabe is going to suppress opposition.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Mugabe's alleged use of food as a tool of repression, the impact on the population, the international context, and the call for Zimbabweans to lead the change. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clear.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of using food as a political weapon, withholding supplies from areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai alleges this is part of a broader campaign of retribution against his supporters, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to Mugabe's ZANU-PF party is strongest. The UN warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government policies, including land invasions that have devastated agriculture. Tsvangirai claims the land-reform program, ostensibly for resettlement, benefits Mugabe's cronies and elites, deepening the crisis. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with some requiring ZANU-PF loyalty to access supplies. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's regime, calling for peaceful resistance and urging Zimbabweans to lead the fight for freedom. He also faces treason charges, denying allegations of plotting against Mugabe. The international community has imposed sanctions, but Tsvangirai emphasizes that change must come from within Zimbabwe. END OF SUMMARY.
