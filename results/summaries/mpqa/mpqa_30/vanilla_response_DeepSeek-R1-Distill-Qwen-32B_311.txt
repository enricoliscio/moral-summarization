Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully.

The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, accusing President Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not voting for him in the March election. He mentions a starvation policy and that it's part of a retribution campaign against him and his supporters. The situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe where opposition is strong.

The UN warns that 1.5 million people are at risk of starvation due to drought and government actions against commercial farms. Mugabe blames drought and sabotage by white farmers but doesn't mention the impact of farm invasions. NGOs report discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF cards or denouncing the MDC to access food.

Tsvangirai also talks about the land reform being used to benefit Mugabe's cronies, calling it the "Last Supper" for ZANU-PF. He commends international sanctions but emphasizes that Zimbabweans must fight for their freedom. He's facing treason charges, denying the plot to assassinate Mugabe and questioning the prosecution's key witness.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the main points: accusations of food withholding as punishment, drought impact, Mugabe's response, discriminatory food distribution, land reform issues, and Tsvangirai's legal situation.

Make sure the summary is clear and concise, including key details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Also, end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused President Robert Mugabe of withholding food from drought-affected areas as punishment for not supporting him in the March election. Tsvangirai claimed this was part of a retribution campaign against his supporters, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to Mugabe's ZANU-PF party is strongest. The UN warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government actions targeting commercial farms. Mugabe blamed drought and sabotage by white farmers but did not address the impact of farm invasions. NGOs reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, requiring ZANU-PF affiliation or denouncing the MDC to access food. Tsvangirai also criticized Mugabe's land-reform program, which he said benefits Mugabe's cronies and elite, calling it a "Last Supper" for ZANU-PF. He praised international sanctions but emphasized that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. Tsvangirai denied treason charges, questioning the prosecution's key witness, Ari Ben-Menashe, and stated there was no case to answer. END OF SUMMARY.
