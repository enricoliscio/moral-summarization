Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him. 

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the key points. Tsvangirai claims that Mugabe's government is using food as a tool for retribution against his supporters. The UN warns about starvation, and there are reports of people needing ZANU-PF cards to buy food. Mugabe's land reforms are benefiting his cronies, leading to economic turmoil.

The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. I need to make sure to use as many of these as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the main accusations and consequences.

I should start by stating Tsvangirai's accusation, then mention the UN warning and the discriminatory distribution. Highlighting the land reforms and their impact on the economy is important. Also, touch on Tsvangirai's trial and his call for peaceful change.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral elements without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election. Tsvangirai claims this is part of a retribution campaign by the ruling ZANU-PF party to crush opposition support. The UN warns of starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of commercial farms, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Discriminatory food distribution has been reported, with some requiring ZANU-PF affiliation to access grain. Tsvangirai alleges Mugabe's land-reform plan benefits cronies and elites, exacerbating economic turmoil. He commends international sanctions but emphasizes Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom. Tsvangirai faces treason charges, denying accusations of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. The situation in Zimbabwe is marked by violence, hunger, and repression, with growing calls for change. END OF SUMMARY.
