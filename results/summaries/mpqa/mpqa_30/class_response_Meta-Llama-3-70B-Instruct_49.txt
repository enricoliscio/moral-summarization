SUMMARY:

Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as retribution for not voting for the ruling party in March's election. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is waging a campaign of violence and hunger against him and his supporters, targeting farmers and rural-area sympathizers. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people required to have a ZANU-PF card or undergo a "cleansing" routine to buy corn. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's land-reform plan, which he claims is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elite. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime and calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom. Tsvangirai is set to stand trial on treason charges, which he denies, and questions the prosecution's case.
