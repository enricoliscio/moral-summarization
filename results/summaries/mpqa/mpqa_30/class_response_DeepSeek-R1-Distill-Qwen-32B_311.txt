Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Morgan Tsvangirai accusing Robert Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not voting for him. There's mention of a starvation policy and retribution against supporters of the opposition. The UN has warned about starvation due to drought and government actions. There's also talk about land reforms benefiting Mugabe's cronies and the opposition facing trials on treason charges.

I need to make sure to include words like "deliberately," "withholding," "retribution," "treason," "violence," "hunger," "state-orchestrated," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Mugabe's actions as morally wrong, using these terms.

I'll start by stating Tsvangirai's accusation, then mention the starvation policy and retribution. Next, I'll include the UN's warning about starvation and the impact of drought and invasions. Then, I'll talk about the discriminatory distribution of food and the process people have to go through. I'll also mention the land reforms benefiting Mugabe's cronies and the treason charges against Tsvangirai. Finally, I'll note Tsvangirai's call for peaceful change and the international sanctions.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key moral points are covered. I'll avoid adding any new information not in the article and stick strictly to the provided content.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-affected areas as retribution for not supporting him in the March election. Tsvangirai alleged that Mugabe's government is pursuing a starvation policy and state-orchestrated violence to crush opposition. The UN warned that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored invasions of commercial farms, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Non-governmental organizations reported discriminatory food distribution, with people needing ZANU-PF cards or undergoing "cleansing" rituals to denounce the MDC before accessing grain. Tsvangirai also criticized Mugabe's land-reform plan, claiming it benefits cronies and party elites rather than the poor. He commended international sanctions but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight for their freedom. Tsvangirai faces treason charges, denying accusations of plotting to assassinate Mugabe. He argued that without key witnesses, the prosecution has no case. The situation in Zimbabwe, marked by violence, hunger, and economic turmoil, is escalating, with Tsvangirai calling for a peaceful, strategic campaign for change against what he describes as a stolen victory and illegitimate government. END OF SUMMARY.
