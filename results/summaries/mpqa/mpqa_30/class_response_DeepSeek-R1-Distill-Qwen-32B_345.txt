Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, accuses President Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for not voting correctly. He mentions a starvation policy as retribution against his supporters. The UN warns about 1.5 million facing starvation due to drought and government actions. There's also talk of discriminatory food distribution, where people need ZANU-PF cards to buy grain. Mugabe's land reforms are putting farms into cronies' hands. Tsvangirai is on trial for treason, denying the charges. He emphasizes the need for Zimbabweans to fight for freedom.

I need to use as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like deliberately, withholding, retribution, treason, violence, hunger, state-orchestrated, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Mugabe's actions as morally wrong, using these terms. I'll start by stating Tsvangirai's accusation, then mention the drought and food issues, the UN warning, discriminatory distribution, land reforms, and Tsvangirai's trial. Conclude with his call for Zimbabweans to fight for freedom.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key moral points. Make sure to include the moral framing words to show the negative actions by Mugabe's government.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food to punish areas that did not support him in the March election, as part of a state-orchestrated campaign of retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is targeting MDC supporters, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe. The UN warns that 1.5 million face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Discriminatory food distribution is reported, with some requiring ZANU-PF cards or denouncing the MDC to access grain. Mugabe's land-reform plan, aimed at resettling poor families, is instead benefiting cronies and ruling party elites. Tsvangirai, who faces treason charges for allegedly plotting Mugabe's assassination, condemns the violence, hunger, and repression, calling for a peaceful mass mobilization to confront Mugabe's illegitimate government. He emphasizes that Zimbabweans must lead the fight for freedom, as international support alone cannot end repression. END OF SUMMARY.
