SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is orchestrating a campaign of violence and hunger against his supporters, particularly in southern Zimbabwe where opposition is strongest. The United Nations warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations report evidence of discriminatory food distribution, where people are forced to denounce their opposition sympathies before being allowed to buy food. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's land-reform plan, which he claims is putting commercial farms in the hands of ruling party elite. He commends Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mugabe's regime and urges Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom. Tsvangirai is set to stand trial on treason charges, which he denies.
