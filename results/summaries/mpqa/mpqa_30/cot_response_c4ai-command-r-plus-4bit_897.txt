SUMMARY:
In an interview, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Tsvangirai alleged that a starvation policy is part of a campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. He spoke about the violence, hunger, and economic turmoil that have plagued Zimbabweans since the controversial election, which he believes was state-orchestrated. Tsvangirai claimed that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest, and that farmers, their workers, and rural sympathizers are being targeted. 

The United Nations World Food Program warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have disrupted food production. Non-governmental organizations operating in Zimbabwe have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. 

Tsvangirai alleged that the land-reform program is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and ruling party elites rather than resettling poor families. He commended international sanctions against Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must ultimately fight peacefully for their freedom. He also addressed his own legal battle, denying charges of treason and plotting to assassinate Mugabe, with the prosecution's key witness being potentially reluctant to testify.
