SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, accuses President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from areas that did not vote for him in the recent election, as a form of punishment. Tsvangirai alleges that Mugabe's government is waging a campaign of retribution against him and his supporters, using starvation as a tool. He claims that the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to Mugabe's party is strongest. The UN World Food Program warns that 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to drought and government-sponsored farm invasions. Non-governmental organizations operating in the country have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution. Tsvangirai condemns Mugabe's regime, accusing it of putting commercial farms in the hands of cronies and elite members, rather than helping poor families. He calls on Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their freedom, saying that the international community can only provide limited support.
