Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of withholding food as punishment for voting against him. There's mention of a starvation policy, retribution, and targeting supporters. The UN warns about starvation, and there's evidence of discriminatory food distribution requiring ZANU-PF membership. Mugabe's land reforms are putting farms into cronies' hands. Tsvangirai talks about the need for peaceful change and mentions his treason trial.

I should include the morally framed words like "deliberately withholding," "retribution," "state-orchestrated," "vendetta," "starvation," "discriminatory distribution," "repression," "freedom," etc. I need to structure the summary to cover these points succinctly.

I'll start by stating Tsvangirai's accusation, then mention the UN warning and evidence of discrimination. Next, talk about Mugabe's land reforms and the targeting of MDC supporters. Finally, mention Tsvangirai's call for peaceful change and his trial.

I should make sure each sentence includes the moral terms without making it too wordy. Let me draft a few sentences and check the word count. I need to stay under 200 words, so I'll keep each point brief.

Wait, the example response provided by the user is 199 words. I should aim for something similar. Let me outline the key points again: accusation of withholding food as punishment, UN warning, discriminatory distribution, land reforms benefiting cronies, call for peaceful change, and the trial.

I'll make sure each of these points is covered with the appropriate moral terms. Now, putting it all together concisely.

SUMMARY:  
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accuses Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food as punishment for areas that opposed him in the March election, calling it a state-orchestrated campaign of retribution. Tsvangirai alleges that the ruling ZANU-PF party is targeting his supporters, with the worst conditions in southern Zimbabwe. The UN warns of starvation, exacerbated by government invasions of commercial farms, which have crippled maize and wheat production. Discriminatory food distribution has been reported, requiring ZANU-PF membership to access supplies. Mugabe's land-reform program, aimed at resettling the poor, has instead enriched cronies and party elites. Tsvangirai emphasizes the need for Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for freedom, as international support alone cannot remove repression. He also faces treason charges, denied by him, with key witnesses possibly reluctant to testify. The situation reflects Mugabe's illegitimate rule and the need for systemic change. END OF SUMMARY.
