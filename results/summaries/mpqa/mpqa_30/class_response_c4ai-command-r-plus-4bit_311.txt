SUMMARY: Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from drought-ravaged areas of the country as punishment for not voting for him in the recent election. Mr. Tsvangirai alleges that this starvation policy is part of a larger campaign of retribution by the ruling ZANU-PF party against him and his supporters. The United Nations World Food Program has warned that up to 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation due to the drought and government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms, which have crippled food production. Non-governmental organizations have also reported evidence of discriminatory food distribution, with people being required to have a ZANU-PF card to buy grain. Mr. Tsvangirai also alleges that the land-reform plan is putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling elite. He commended international sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime but emphasized that Zimbabweans must fight peacefully for their own freedom. He is facing his own legal battle, with a trial on treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mr. Mugabe.
