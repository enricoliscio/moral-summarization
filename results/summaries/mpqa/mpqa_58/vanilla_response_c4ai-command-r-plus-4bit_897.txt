SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts debate Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to increased agricultural productivity in colder regions. However, concerns are raised about the potential negative impacts on ecosystems and the need for adaptation to climate change. The Kyoto Protocol provides a market mechanism to address global environmental issues, and Russia has a significant role in its implementation due to its high emissions. The protocol assigns emission quotas to countries and allows trading of these quotas. Russia's ratification is seen as crucial, and the potential benefits for the country are discussed, including increased demand for natural gas and the opportunity to sell emission quotas. However, the Foreign Ministry advises that Russia's efforts should be integrated with those of the EU to maximize impact. The article also provides background information on the Kyoto Protocol, the preceding UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the potential economic and ecological implications of the protocol for Russia. 

END OF SUMMARY.
