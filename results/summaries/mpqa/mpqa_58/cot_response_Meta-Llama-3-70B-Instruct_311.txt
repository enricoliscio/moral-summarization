SUMMARY:
Russia is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While some experts believe Russia will benefit from global warming, others argue that it's a false assumption. The country's emissions are already 25% lower than in 1990, and it's not required to reduce them further. However, the warming trend poses a threat to ecosystems, and Russia's infrastructure, particularly in permafrost regions, is at risk. Experts warn that the country's activities are ruining nature, and that the Kyoto Protocol's implementation is costly but necessary. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will integrate Russia's efforts with those of the EU. END OF SUMMARY.
