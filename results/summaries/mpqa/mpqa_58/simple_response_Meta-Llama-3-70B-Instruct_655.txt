SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to discuss Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that the country will benefit from global warming, while others warn of its negative consequences. Russia has a significant stake in the protocol's ratification, as it can sell its "hot air" quotas to other countries. However, some experts argue that this approach is short-sighted and will not provide an impetus for the country to develop nature-conservation technologies. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will integrate Russia's efforts with those of the European Union. The Kyoto Protocol is a crucial step in addressing climate change, and Russia's participation is essential for its success.
