SUMMARY: Well-known scientists gathered to discuss Russia's place in the global climatic strategy and the upcoming ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a pivotal document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The discussion centered around the alarming rise in global temperatures and its potential consequences, such as the unbalancing of ecosystems and the negative impact on agriculture. While some experts suggested Russia would benefit from climate change due to the transformation of permafrost into fertile soils, others refuted this idea, emphasizing the costly and harmful nature of such perturbations. The roundtable concluded that Russia has a controlling stake in the Kyoto Protocol, and its ratification is essential for integrating Russian efforts with those of the EU. Speakers also highlighted the need to adapt to climate change and expressed concerns about the potential harm caused by proposed solutions like sun-screening space umbrellas. The underlying message was clear: human activities are ruining nature, and any further harmful interventions could have frightening consequences.
