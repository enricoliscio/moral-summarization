SUMMARY: Tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government will discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy and the potential impact of global warming. While some argued that Russia could benefit economically from the Protocol, others emphasized the environmental costs of climate change. Sergey Kapitsa questioned the predicted amount of warming and advocated for a paleoclimatological approach to understanding past climate changes. Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy, a Foreign Ministry official, argued that Russia's efforts should be integrated with those of the EU to maximize impact. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, assigns countries emission quotas and allows for the trading of quotas. Russia's obligations under the Protocol are relatively mild, as its emissions are already significantly lower than in 1990. Experts emphasized the need to adapt to climate change and expressed concerns about the potential damage caused by human activities. Russia's ratification of the Protocol is seen as crucial for its success, given its significant emissions.
