SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to discuss Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that the country will benefit from global warming due to its fertile soils and potential to sell "hot air" credits. However, others warned that the country's efforts should focus on reducing emissions and developing nature-conservation technologies, rather than relying on trading quotas. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, citing the benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the European Union. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from 1990 levels by 2008-2012, with Russia's obligations relatively mild due to its already reduced emissions.
