Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words used by the author. The user has provided a list of these words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary without making it sound forced.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Russia considering ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, discussions among scientists and policymakers, and the implications of global warming. The moral framing words are action verbs and terms related to responsibility, environmental impact, and policy decisions.

I should structure the summary to cover the key elements: the meeting agenda, the Kyoto Protocol's goals, the debate among experts, the potential benefits and risks for Russia, the stance of the Foreign Ministry, and the overall implications of climate change.

I'll start by mentioning the agenda and the importance of the Kyoto Protocol. Then, I'll touch on the scientists' discussions, the arguments for and against ratification, and the consequences of global warming. I'll ensure to use words like'reduce,' 'ratify,' 'control,' 'gain,' 'threat,' 'damage,' etc., as they fit naturally into the summary.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed. The summary should reflect the moral implications, such as the responsibility to control emissions and the potential negative effects of inaction or certain policies.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and maintain a clear, concise structure. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and adjust as necessary.

SUMMARY:  
The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. Scientists and policymakers debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia could gain economically by selling emission quotas, while others warned of the risks of inaction. The Protocol, first proposed by Mikhail Budyko, seeks to control global warming, but experts remain divided on its effectiveness. Some, like Andrey Gudkov, suggested innovative solutions like a space-based "sun-screening umbrella," though such ideas face political and economic challenges. Others, like Sergey Kapitsa, emphasized the need to learn from historical climate data and avoid oversimplifying complex systems. Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy of the Foreign Ministry argued that ratification would integrate Russia into global efforts, while critics warned against relying solely on selling "hot air." The debate highlighted the moral imperative to address climate change, with concerns over the potential damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and vulnerable regions. The Protocol's success hinges on Russia's participation, as its emissions are significant, and its stance could influence global efforts to stabilize the climate. END OF SUMMARY.
