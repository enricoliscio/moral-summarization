SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Scientists and experts gathered to define Russia's place in global climatic strategy, emphasizing the need to take control of global warming. While some argue that Russia will gain from climate change, others warn that it poses a threat to the country and the world. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change, and Russia's ratification is crucial to its implementation. The country has a significant stake in the protocol's success, as it can sell its "hot air" quotas to other countries. However, some experts caution that Russia's efforts should focus on reducing emissions and investing in nature-conservation technologies, rather than merely dealing in "hot air." The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will integrate Russia's efforts with those of the European Union and promote rational development.
