SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol assigns countries quotas on their emissions, and Russia has signed the document but not yet ratified it. Experts argue that Russia stands to gain from the protocol, as it has "hot air" (emissions below the permitted level) and can sell quotas to other countries. However, others warn that relying on selling quotas will not provide an impetus to develop nature-conservation technologies and may hinder Russia's integration into the European Union. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, citing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The protocol is seen as a crucial step in preventing dangerous climate changes, and Russia's ratification is crucial for its implementation.
