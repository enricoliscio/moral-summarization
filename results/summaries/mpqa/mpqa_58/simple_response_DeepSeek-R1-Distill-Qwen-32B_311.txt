Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's stance on it. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article discusses the upcoming Russian government meeting about ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It mentions that several countries have already ratified it, and Russia's position is crucial because without them, the protocol might fail.

There are different opinions among experts. Some, like Andrey Gudkov, think Russia could benefit economically from selling emission quotas. Others, like Sergey Kapitsa, are skeptical about the benefits and the science behind global warming. Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy from the Foreign Ministry argues that ratifying the protocol isn't just about economic gains but about integrating with global efforts, especially the EU.

The article also touches on the potential negative impacts of global warming, such as rising sea levels and ecosystem disruptions, emphasizing that the consequences aren't just about economic gains but have broader environmental and social implications.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, highlighting the debate, the economic versus environmental perspectives, and the moral implications of Russia's decision. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll focus on the key arguments and the moral framing around responsibility and global impact.
