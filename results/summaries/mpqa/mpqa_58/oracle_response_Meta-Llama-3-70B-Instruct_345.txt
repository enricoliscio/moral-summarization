SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Scientists and experts gathered to define Russia's place in global climatic strategy, emphasizing the need to take control of global warming. While some argue that Russia will gain from climate change, others warn that it poses a significant threat to the country and the world. The Kyoto Protocol provides a market-based mechanism for reducing emissions, allowing countries to buy and sell quotas. Russia has a significant stake in the protocol's ratification, as it can gain from selling its "hot air" and investing in nature-conservation technologies. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will integrate Russia's efforts with those of the EU and provide an impetus for rational development. Experts stress that climate change is a pressing issue that requires cooperation and efforts to reduce emissions, adapt to its effects, and prevent further damage to nature.
