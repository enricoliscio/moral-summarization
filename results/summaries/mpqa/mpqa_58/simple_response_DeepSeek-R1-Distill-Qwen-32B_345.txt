Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's stance on it. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Russian government considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. It mentions that the EU, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada are on board. There's a discussion among scientists about the benefits and costs for Russia, like the agricultural gains but also the potential environmental damage. Some experts argue that Russia can profit from selling emission quotas, while others warn about the long-term economic and environmental impacts. The article also brings up the idea of using a space umbrella to block the sun, which seems impractical. There's a debate about whether the protocol is a market opportunity or a costly endeavor. The summary needs to capture these points succinctly, highlighting the moral considerations like environmental responsibility versus economic gain.

I should structure the summary to include the main arguments for and against ratification, the potential economic benefits, the environmental risks, and the moral implications. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it's clear and concise is key. I'll need to mention the Kyoto Protocol's goals, Russia's position, the experts' differing opinions, and the moral framing around environmental responsibility.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While some experts argue that Russia could benefit economically by selling unused emission quotas, others warn of the long-term environmental and economic risks. The debate highlights the moral dilemma of balancing economic gain with global climate responsibility. Russia's potential role in shaping the protocol's future underscores the importance of its decision, as the country holds significant influence over the agreement's success. The discussion also raises concerns about the adequacy of current models to predict climate change and the need for integrated approaches, including paleoclimatology, to address the issue effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
