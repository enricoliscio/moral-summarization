SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that the country will benefit from global warming due to its fertile soils and potential to sell "hot air" credits. However, others have cautioned against this view, highlighting the need for Russia to take a proactive role in reducing emissions and investing in nature-conservation technologies. The Foreign Ministry has recommended ratifying the protocol, citing the benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The Kyoto Protocol has been signed by over 80 countries, but the US has withdrawn from the agreement. Russia's emissions are currently 25% lower than in 1990, and the country is not required to reduce emissions under the protocol.

END OF SUMMARY.
