Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Russia's consideration of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is on the agenda for the Russian government's meeting. It's an important international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A group of scientists discussed Russia's role in global climate strategy. The EU and other countries like Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada are on board with ratification, which makes the international community hopeful.

The article then goes into the history of climate change discussions, mentioning Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko who first raised concerns about global warming 40 years ago. There's a debate about whether Russia might benefit from global warming, especially in agriculture, but this is countered by the negative impacts on other regions.

Experts like Andrey Gudkov suggest geoengineering solutions, like a space umbrella to block the sun, but these ideas are dismissed due to political and economic reasons. Sergey Kapitsa argues that the predicted warming might not be as severe as feared, citing paleoclimatology data. Others discuss the economic implications of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, such as Russia's potential to sell emission quotas and the benefits for the gas industry.

There's a debate between those who see economic gains from the protocol and those who worry it might not push Russia towards developing green technologies. Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy from the Foreign Ministry supports ratification, emphasizing the importance of integrating with EU efforts.

The article also provides background on the Kyoto Protocol, its objectives, and Russia's current situation. Russia's emissions are below 1990 levels, giving them surplus quotas to sell. However, there are concerns about the long-term environmental impacts of global warming and the limitations of current models.

In summary, the key points are: the upcoming Russian government meeting on Kyoto, discussions about Russia's role and benefits, debates over economic versus environmental impacts, and the potential for Russia to influence global climate efforts through ratification.

Now, I'll condense these points into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main arguments and the significance of Russia's decision.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some suggesting potential agricultural benefits from global warming, while others warn of severe consequences like rising sea levels and ecosystem disruption. Geoengineering ideas, such as a space umbrella, were dismissed due to political and economic constraints. Sergey Kapitsa questioned the severity of predicted warming, citing historical climate data. The discussion highlighted economic gains from selling emission quotas, but Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy emphasized the need for sustainable development and integration with EU efforts. Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol could position Russia as a key player in global climate efforts, despite concerns about relying solely on quota trading. The decision is crucial for addressing global warming and advancing environmental technologies. END OF SUMMARY.
