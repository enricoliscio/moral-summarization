SUMMARY:
The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While some experts believe Russia will gain from global warming, others argue that it is a threat to the entire humankind. The country has a significant stake in the protocol's ratification, as it can sell its "hot air" quotas to other nations. However, this approach is deemed uneconomical and costly, as it will not provide an impetus to develop high technologies. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will integrate Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The Kyoto Protocol is the first international document to use the market mechanism to solve global ecological problems, making it a brilliant approach. If Russia fails to take action, it will be extremely frightening, as all human activities are already ruining nature. END OF SUMMARY.
