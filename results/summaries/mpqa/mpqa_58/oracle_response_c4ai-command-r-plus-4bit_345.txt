SUMMARY: Russia is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to increased agricultural productivity. However, others expressed skepticism about the predicted amount of warming and highlighted the need to consider paleoclimatological data. It was generally agreed that climate change is occurring rapidly and that human contribution is significant. Russia has a controlling stake in the Kyoto Protocol, as its ratification is crucial for the agreement's success. Experts discussed the potential benefits of carbon trading for Russia, as it has a surplus of emission quotas. The Foreign Ministry recommended ratification, emphasizing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, assigns countries emission quotas and encourages the use of market mechanisms to address global ecological problems. Russia's obligations under the protocol are relatively mild, as its emissions are currently below the baseline level. Experts emphasized the negative consequences of climate change, including ecosystem disruption and rising sea levels, and cautioned against further damaging nature with untested solutions.
