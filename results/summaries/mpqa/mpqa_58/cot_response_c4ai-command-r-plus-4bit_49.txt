SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While some experts argue that Russia will benefit economically from climate change due to its vast agricultural lands and gas resources, others emphasize the potential negative consequences, such as the unbalancing of ecosystems and the threat to infrastructure built on permafrost. The discussion highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a comprehensive understanding of climate change and its potential impacts. The article concludes that Russia has a significant role to play in addressing global warming and that the Kyoto Protocol provides an opportunity for the country to take a leading position in the fight against climate change. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the potential harm caused by human activities and the importance of taking responsible actions to mitigate negative consequences.
