SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically from the Protocol, while others emphasized the potential negative impacts of climate change on Russia's environment and economy. The discussion also touched on the scientific uncertainties surrounding climate change and the potential for Russia to sell carbon emission quotas on the international market. The majority of participants agreed that human activity contributes significantly to climate change and that Russia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions and benefit economically. The article also provides background information on the Kyoto Protocol, the preceding UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the potential ecological and economic impacts of the Protocol on Russia.
