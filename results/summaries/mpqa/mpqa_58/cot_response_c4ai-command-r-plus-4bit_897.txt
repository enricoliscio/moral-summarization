SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia would benefit economically from global warming due to the agricultural potential of thawing permafrost lands. However, concerns were raised about the negative consequences for the country's infrastructure and ecosystems, as well as the potential for extreme weather events. The article highlights the potential for Russia to profit from the sale of emission quotas, given its current low level of emissions. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratification, emphasizing the economic benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The article also provides background on the Kyoto Protocol, its predecessor, and the obligations of signatory countries. Experts emphasize the harm caused by human activities to nature and the need to adapt to climate change rather than attempt unproven solutions like space umbrellas. The moral framing of the article centers around the potential benefits and harms of climate change for Russia, with a focus on economic, environmental, and technological implications.
