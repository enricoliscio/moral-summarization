SUMMARY: 

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to define Russia's place in global climatic strategy, emphasizing the need to take control of global warming. While some argue that Russia will gain from climate change, others warn that it poses a threat to the country and the world. The protocol proposes adapting to climate change, and Russia's ratification is crucial, as it has a controlling block of shares. Experts urge the government to move forward with ratification, citing the benefits of integrating into the efforts of the European Union. The protocol's implementation is tied to the market mechanism, making it uneconomical to ignore. Russia's efforts should focus on nature-conservation and reducing emissions, rather than dealing in "hot air." The country's energy requirements are among the highest in the world, and reducing emissions is a problem of energy efficiency and energy saving. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will provide an impetus to start up high technologies and integrate Russia into the group of countries striving for rational development.
