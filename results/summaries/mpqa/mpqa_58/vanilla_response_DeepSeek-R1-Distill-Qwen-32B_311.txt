Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's stance on it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the Russian government is discussing ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which is an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also talks about a meeting where scientists discussed Russia's role in global climate strategy.

Next, it mentions that several countries, including EU members, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada, are ready to ratify the protocol. This makes the international community hopeful about solving climate issues. The article then goes into some history, mentioning Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko who first raised concerns about global warming 40 years ago. There's a debate about whether Russia would benefit from global warming, with some experts suggesting that agricultural lands might expand, but others caution against the broader negative impacts.

The article discusses various expert opinions. Some believe Russia could gain economically by selling emission quotas, while others, like Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy, argue that relying on such quotas might hinder technological and economic development. There's also a mention of the Kyoto Protocol's market mechanisms and how Russia's lower emissions compared to 1990 levels could allow it to sell surplus quotas.

The summary should cover the key points: the upcoming Russian government meeting on Kyoto, the international support for the protocol, differing expert opinions on Russia's benefits and challenges, the potential economic gains from selling quotas, and the broader implications of global warming.

I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, ensuring all main points are included without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that the country could benefit economically by selling emission quotas due to its lower emissions compared to 1990 levels. Others, however, caution that relying on such quotas might hinder technological and economic progress. The Kyoto Protocol, which uses market mechanisms to address climate change, has been ratified by over 40 nations, including many EU members, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada. Russia's ratification is crucial, as the protocol requires participation from major emitters like the US and Russia to be effective. While some experts see potential economic gains for Russia, others emphasize the need for sustainable development and warn against the broader negative impacts of global warming, such as environmental damage and infrastructure risks. END OF SUMMARY.
