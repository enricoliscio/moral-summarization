SUMMARY:
The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts believe that Russia will gain from the protocol, as it can sell its "hot air" and become a dominant seller in the market. However, others argue that this approach is false and costly, and that Russia should focus on developing nature-conservation technologies instead. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, as it will have a greater impact when integrated into the efforts of the EU. Experts warn that climate change is a threat to the entire world, and that Russia's efforts will be futile if it only focuses on selling its quotas. The country's emissions are already 25% lower than in 1990, and it has a great potential for energy efficiency and energy saving. END OF SUMMARY.
