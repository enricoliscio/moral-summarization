SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to the transformation of permafrost into fertile agricultural land. However, others, including Sergey Kapitsa, questioned the accuracy of predicted warming levels. The discussion also focused on the economic implications of the protocol, with Russia having the potential to become a dominant seller in the carbon market due to its "hot air" status. Nikolai Ratsiborinsky, a Foreign Ministry advisor, emphasized the importance of investing in nature-conservation technologies rather than solely relying on trading emissions quotas. The article also provides background on the Kyoto Protocol, its predecessors, and the obligations of countries, including Russia, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts expressed concerns about the negative consequences of climate change, such as the impact on ecosystems and rising sea levels, while acknowledging the challenges and costs associated with implementing the protocol. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of climate change and the potential risks of human interventions like blocking shields. END OF SUMMARY.
