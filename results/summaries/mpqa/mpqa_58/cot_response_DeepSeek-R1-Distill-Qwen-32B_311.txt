Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Russia considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, discussing the implications, both positive and negative, for Russia and the global community. There are mentions of scientists, economic benefits, environmental impacts, and political strategies.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry a moral connotation. These could be words like "important," "hopeful," "alarm," "uneasy," "gain," "control," "obliged," "costly," "rational," "brilliant," "destruction," "damage," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that has a moral or evaluative meaning.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: the meeting about Kyoto, the debate among scientists and experts, the potential benefits and costs for Russia, the environmental concerns, and the implications of ratification.

I have to ensure that the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll structure it by introducing the topic, discussing the arguments for and against ratification, and concluding with the potential outcomes.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear, making sure each sentence contributes to the overall moral framing. I'll also need to check that I'm not adding any new information beyond what's in the article.

Alright, let's start by listing the morally framed words. I'll go through each paragraph and pick them out. Then, I'll draft the summary, weaving in those words to maintain the original moral perspective.
