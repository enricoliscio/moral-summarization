SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically from global warming due to increased agricultural productivity in permafrost regions. However, others expressed skepticism about the predicted benefits and emphasized the need for a comprehensive understanding of paleoclimatology data. The discussion also touched on the trading of air quotas and the potential for Russia to dominate this market. The role of the Kyoto Protocol in promoting the development of high technologies and the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU were highlighted. The article also provides background information on the Kyoto Protocol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the potential economic and ecological impacts of the protocol's implementation. The Foreign Ministry's recommendation to ratify the protocol is supported by experts, who emphasize the need for a holistic approach to addressing climate change and the potential benefits for Russia's economic development.
