SUMMARY: Tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government includes the question of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Well-known scientists recently discussed Russia's role in global climatic strategy. While some argue that Russia will benefit from global warming due to the agricultural potential of its northern regions, others advocate for blocking the sun with a space umbrella to prevent overheating. The discussion also focused on the trading of air and Russia's potential as a dominant seller in the carbon market. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, highlighting the benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. However, critics argue that dealing in "hot air" will not promote high technologies and will hinder Russia's strive for rational development. The Kyoto Protocol is the first international document to use market mechanisms to address global ecological problems, and Russia's efforts to reduce emissions are crucial for its success.

END OF SUMMARY.
