Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article discusses the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's role in its ratification. It mentions the environmental impact, economic benefits, and political considerations. The author uses words like "reduce," "ratify," "solve," "control," "gain," and "damage," which are key moral terms I need to include.

I should start by outlining the key sections: the meeting agenda, the EU and other countries' commitments, the debate on benefits vs. risks, and the implications for Russia. I need to ensure that the moral implications, like the potential benefits for Russia's agriculture and the risks of global warming, are highlighted.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the meeting and the Kyoto Protocol, then the international context, followed by the debate among scientists and policymakers. I'll include the moral framing words as they appear in the article, ensuring the summary stays within 200 words.

Let me draft a concise version, making sure to include the necessary moral terms and the main arguments for and against ratification. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The article highlights the moral and economic implications of this decision, emphasizing the potential benefits for Russia, such as gaining from global warming through increased agricultural productivity in previously frozen regions. However, experts warn that global warming poses significant risks, including rising sea levels, ecosystem disruption, and infrastructure damage. The debate also centers on the economic opportunities of trading emission quotas, with some arguing that Russia could profit from its "hot air" surplus. Others caution against relying solely on market mechanisms, stressing the need for sustainable development and technological innovation. The moral framing underscores the responsibility to protect the environment and the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with global climate strategies. The article concludes that while the Kyoto Protocol offers economic gains, it also demands a commitment to reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
