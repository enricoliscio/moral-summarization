SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia would benefit from climate change due to the potential for increased agricultural production in previously frozen regions. However, it was noted that the overall impact on humanity would be negative, and an expert proposed a space umbrella to block the sun's rays and prevent overheating. The discussion also touched on the economic benefits of Russia ratifying the protocol, as the country has a large amount of "hot air" to sell on the carbon market. Sergey Kapitsa, a well-known scientist, questioned the predicted amount of future warming and emphasized the need to understand past climate changes before making forecasts. The Foreign Ministry recommended ratification, as integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU would have a greater impact. The article also provides background on the Kyoto Protocol, the preceding UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the obligations of countries under the protocol. Experts expressed concern about the negative consequences of climate change and the need to adapt rather than attempt unproven solutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
