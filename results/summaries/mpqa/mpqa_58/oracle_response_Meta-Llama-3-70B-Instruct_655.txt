SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Scientists and experts gathered to define Russia's place in global climatic strategy, emphasizing the need to take control of global warming. While some argued that Russia would gain from climate change, others warned of the threats it poses to ecosystems and human societies. The experts agreed that human activities are ruining nature and that the Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change. Russia's ratification of the protocol is crucial, as it would provide an impetus for the development of nature-conservation technologies and integrate the country's efforts with those of the European Union. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratification, citing the importance of cooperation and the need to reduce emissions. The protocol assigns countries quotas on their emissions, and Russia's obligations are relatively mild, with no requirement to reduce emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
