SUMMARY:
The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While some experts believe Russia will gain from global warming, others argue that the country's efforts to reduce emissions will be costly and uneconomical. The protocol's implementation is tied to the market mechanism, making it uneconomical to ignore environmental protection. Russia's emissions are almost twice as great as those of Germany and Japan, and the country has a significant stake in the protocol's ratification. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the document, as it will have a greater impact when integrated into the efforts of the European Union. Experts warn that global warming will have a negative effect on ecosystems, and all human activities are ruining nature. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change, and experts urge Russia to take action to reduce its emissions.
