SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to discuss Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to its fertile lands in the Arctic zone. However, others, including Sergey Kapitsa, questioned the predicted amount of future warming and emphasized the need to learn from the past to predict the future. The consensus was that climate change is underway, and human contributions are significant. Russia has a controlling block of shares in the Kyoto Protocol, and its ratification is crucial. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratification, citing the benefits of integrating national efforts with those of the EU. Critics argue that Russia's efforts should focus on developing nature-conservation technologies rather than trading "hot air." The Kyoto Protocol is a market-based approach to solving global ecological problems, and Russia's ratification could bring significant economic benefits.
