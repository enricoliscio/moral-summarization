SUMMARY: Tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government includes the question of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists recently discussed Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically from global warming, while others emphasized the need for a transition to high technologies and nature-conservation efforts. The round table concluded that Russia should ratify the document, as it has a significant stake in the carbon market and stands to gain from increased gas demand. However, the Foreign Ministry's view is that Russia's efforts should be integrated with those of the EU for greater impact. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, assigns countries emission quotas and allows for the trading of these quotas. Russia's emissions are currently almost twice as high as Germany's and Japan's, and ratifying the protocol would mean reducing emissions by 20% in the next five years. Experts warn that climate change will have severe consequences, including the disappearance of species, rising sea levels, and negative impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure. While there are varying models and opinions on the causes and effects of climate change, all human actions currently contribute to its deterioration. Russia has a unique opportunity to benefit economically while also playing a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.
