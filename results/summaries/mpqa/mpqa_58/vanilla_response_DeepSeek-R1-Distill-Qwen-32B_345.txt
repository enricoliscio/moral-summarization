Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's stance. The article is quite detailed, so I should break it down into key points.

First, the main topic is the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Russia. The meeting is discussing this, and it's a significant international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Then, the article mentions that several countries like the EU, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada are on board with ratifying it. This shows the global support but also highlights that without Russia and the US, the protocol might not be effective.

Next, there are discussions about the benefits Russia might gain, such as agricultural advantages from warmer temperatures. However, experts like Gudkov propose technical solutions like a space umbrella, which seems unlikely due to political and economic reasons.

On the other hand, Sergey Kapitsa questions the severity of global warming and suggests looking into paleoclimatology for better understanding. This adds a scientific debate element to the discussion.

The article also covers the economic aspects, like Russia's potential to sell emission quotas, which could bring in billions. However, critics like Ratsiborinskiy argue that relying solely on selling quotas won't drive technological innovation and could isolate Russia from the EU.

Finally, the Kyoto Protocol's background is provided, including its adoption in 1997, the emission targets, and Russia's position relative to other countries. The conclusion is that ratifying the protocol is complex but necessary for global efforts.

I should make sure the summary captures these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol has been ratified by over 40 countries, including most EU nations, but its success depends on Russia and the US. Russia's emissions are nearly 25% below 1990 levels, allowing it to sell emission quotas worth billions. Experts debate the benefits, with some arguing Russia could gain economically, while others warn against relying solely on selling quotas, as it may hinder technological progress. The protocol's market-based mechanisms aim to reduce emissions, but its implementation faces challenges. Ratification is seen as crucial for global efforts to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
