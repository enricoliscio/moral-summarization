SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Russia has a significant role to play in the protocol's success, as it is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The country's emissions are currently 25% lower than in 1990, and it is not required to reduce emissions under the protocol. Instead, Russia can sell its "hot air" quotas to other countries, potentially earning billions of dollars. However, experts warn that climate change is a serious issue that requires cooperation and action, rather than just profiting from it. They argue that Russia's energy efficiency and energy-saving potential are underutilized, and that the country should focus on reducing its emissions rather than just trading quotas. The Foreign Ministry supports ratification, citing the benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the European Union.
