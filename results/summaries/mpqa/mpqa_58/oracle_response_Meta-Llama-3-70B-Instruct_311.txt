SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The protocol assigns countries quotas on their emissions, and Russia, as the third-largest emitter, has a significant role to play. Experts argue that Russia can gain from the protocol by selling its "hot air" and becoming a dominant seller in the market. However, others warn that this approach is short-sighted and may hinder the country's technological and economic development. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, citing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the European Union. The protocol's implementation is seen as a costly but necessary step towards reducing emissions and achieving a stabilization of the greenhouse gas content in the atmosphere. Russia's obligations under the protocol are relatively mild, and the country is not required to reduce its emissions. Instead, it must maintain records of and monitor its emissions, as well as regulate quotas. Experts stress the need to take control of global warming, learn from the past, and adapt to climate change.
