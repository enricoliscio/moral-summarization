SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to discuss Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to increased agricultural production in previously permafrost regions. However, others cautioned that the benefits would be short-lived and that the country's efforts should focus on reducing emissions and developing nature-conservation technologies. The Kyoto Protocol assigns countries quotas on their emissions, and Russia has a significant stake in its ratification, with the potential to sell "hot air" quotas to other countries. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratifying the protocol, citing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the European Union. Experts warn that climate change will have devastating effects on ecosystems, infrastructure, and human societies, and that Russia must take a proactive role in addressing this global issue.
