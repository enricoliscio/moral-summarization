Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Russia considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It mentions various perspectives from scientists and experts, discussing the potential benefits and drawbacks for Russia, like economic gains from selling emission quotas versus the environmental impact.

I should identify the key moral arguments presented. On one side, there's the idea that Russia could benefit economically by selling its unused emission quotas, which is a positive economic standpoint. On the other side, there's concern about the environmental consequences of global warming, such as rising sea levels and ecosystem damage, which are presented as negative impacts that Russia might not be immune to despite potential economic gains.

I need to ensure the summary captures these moral framings. It should highlight both the economic opportunities and the environmental risks, showing the tension between economic interests and environmental responsibility. Also, the article mentions the potential for Russia to influence global efforts against climate change, which adds a layer of moral responsibility.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the topic, then present the different viewpoints, and conclude with the implications of Russia's decision. Keeping it concise, around 200 words, I'll make sure each moral angle is clearly represented without getting bogged down in technical details.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. The summary needs to reflect the debate's essence, emphasizing the balance between economic benefits and environmental stewardship. I'll also include the mention of the Kyoto Protocol's mechanisms, like emission trading, as part of the moral consideration.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the meeting's agenda, moving through the experts' arguments, and ending with the potential consequences of Russia's decision. This way, the moral framing is preserved, showing the dilemma between economic gain and environmental duty.

SUMMARY:  
The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts debate Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically by selling unused emission quotas. Others warn of the dangers of global warming, such as rising sea levels, ecosystem disruption, and extreme weather events. While some see potential gains for Russia, like increased agricultural productivity in northern regions, others emphasize the moral responsibility to address climate change, as global warming affects all nations. The Kyoto Protocol's market-based mechanisms, including emission trading, are seen as a way to incentivize environmental action. However, critics caution against relying solely on economic gains, stressing the need for sustainable development and technological innovation. The debate highlights the tension between economic interests and the imperative to protect the environment for future generations. END OF SUMMARY.
