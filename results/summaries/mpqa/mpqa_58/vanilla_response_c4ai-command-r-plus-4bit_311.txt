SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The document has been signed by over 80 nations and ratified by almost 40. Russia, the world's third-largest emitter, is expected to benefit from the protocol as it has "hot air," or excess carbon emission quotas, that it can sell on the carbon market. However, some experts argue that Russia's reliance on dealing in "hot air" will not drive the development of high technologies and could hinder the country's technological and economic progress.

The roundtable discussion on Russia's role in global climatic strategy raised concerns about the impact of climate change on Russia and the world. While some experts argued that Russia would benefit from global warming due to the transformation of permafrost into fertile soils, others highlighted the potential negative consequences, such as the unbalancing of ecosystems and the rise in sea levels, which could affect low-lying areas like St. Petersburg and Western Siberia.

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, assigns countries emission quotas and allows for the trading of excess quotas. Russia's obligations under the protocol are relatively mild, as its emissions are already significantly below the baseline year of 1990. The document is expected to positively impact Russia's gas demand and provide economic benefits through the trading of emission quotas.

The discussion concluded that Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is crucial for its successful implementation and that the country has a significant role in addressing global warming.
