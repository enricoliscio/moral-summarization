Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Kyoto Protocol and Russia's involvement. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that the Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. It talks about a meeting where scientists discussed Russia's role in global climate strategy. The EU and other countries like Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada are on board, which is hopeful for the UN Convention on Climate Change.

Then, it goes into some history, mentioning Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko who first raised concerns about global warming. There's a debate about whether Russia could benefit from warmer temperatures, but experts like Sergey Kapitsa argue that the predicted warming isn't certain and might not be as severe as feared.

The article also discusses the Kyoto Protocol's specifics, like emission quotas and the market mechanism for selling surplus emissions. Russia has a surplus, which could be a big money-maker. However, Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy from the Foreign Ministry warns that just selling quotas won't push Russia towards high-tech development and integration with the EU.

There's a mention of the potential negative impacts of global warming, like rising sea levels and infrastructure damage, even in Russia. Experts are cautious about relying solely on market mechanisms without investing in new technologies.

So, the summary should cover the key points: the meeting, Russia's potential benefits and risks, the Kyoto Protocol's mechanisms, and the debate over whether ratification is just about selling quotas or driving technological advancement.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically from selling surplus emission quotas. However, others caution that relying solely on market mechanisms could hinder technological and economic progress. The protocol, which allows countries to trade emission quotas, has been ratified by over 40 nations, but Russia's decision is critical due to its significant emissions. Experts emphasize the need for Russia to integrate into global efforts to address climate change, rather than focusing solely on short-term economic gains. END OF SUMMARY.
