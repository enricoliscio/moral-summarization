SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia could benefit economically from global warming due to the potential increase in agricultural land. However, concerns were raised about the negative impact on ecosystems and the need to adapt to climate change. The Kyoto Protocol assigns countries quotas on emissions and allows for the trading of excess quotas. Russia has a significant stake in the ratification, as it has a large amount of "hot air" or excess CO2 emission quotas that it can sell on the carbon market. The article also discusses the potential economic benefits of compliance with the protocol for Russia's gas industry. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratification, emphasizing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. Experts warn that relying solely on dealing in "hot air" will not provide an impetus for technological development and that Russia should focus on nature-conservation efforts and investment in high technologies. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of climate change and the potential risks and benefits for Russia.
