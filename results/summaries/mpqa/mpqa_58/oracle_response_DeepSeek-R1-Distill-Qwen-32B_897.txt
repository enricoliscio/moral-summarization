Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by understanding the article's main points. It's about the Russian government considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The article discusses various expert opinions on the benefits and challenges of ratifying the protocol. 

The author uses words like "reduce," "define," "ratify," and "control," which carry moral connotations. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

The article mentions that several countries, including EU members, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada, are planning to ratify the protocol. Russia's position is crucial because without it, the protocol might not be effective. Experts like Andrey Gudkov argue that Russia could benefit economically by selling emission quotas. However, others, like Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy, caution that relying solely on selling quotas might hinder technological and economic development.

The Kyoto Protocol is seen as a way to control global warming, which is a threat, especially to southern countries. There's also a discussion about the potential negative effects of global warming on Russia's infrastructure and environment, like melting permafrost and rising sea levels.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll focus on the key points: the ratification consideration, the international context, expert opinions on economic gains versus broader environmental concerns, and the potential consequences of global warming. I'll ensure to use the morally framed words the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. The Protocol has been ratified by over 40 nations, including EU members, Iceland, Japan, Australia, and Canada. Russia's ratification is crucial, as the Protocol cannot be implemented without it. Experts debate the benefits, with some arguing Russia could gain economically by selling emission quotas, while others warn against relying solely on such deals, emphasizing the need for broader environmental efforts. Global warming is seen as a threat, particularly to southern countries, though Russia's permafrost regions may initially benefit. However, the long-term risks include infrastructure damage, rising sea levels, and ecological disruption. The Protocol's market mechanisms, like emission trading, aim to control emissions, but critics caution against neglecting technological and environmental progress. Ratification is viewed as a moral obligation to address climate change, despite political and economic challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
