Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a specific structure to follow. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to write a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, I see several morally charged words. Let me go through it step by step. The article talks about the Kyoto Protocol, which is about reducing greenhouse gases. Words like "ratification," "reduce," "global climatic strategy," "hopeful," "problem," "alarm," "consequences," "gain," "control," "threat," "obliged," "dominant," "advantageous," "rational development," "sustainable," "damage," "harm," "destruction," "obliged," "dominant," "advantageous," "rational," "sustainable," "damage," "harm," "destruction," "obliged," "dominant," "advantageous," "rational," "sustainable," "damage," "harm," "destruction." 

Wait, I should list each unique word once. So, the list includes: ratification, reduce, global climatic strategy, hopeful, problem, alarm, consequences, gain, control, threat, obliged, dominant, advantageous, rational, sustainable, damage, harm, destruction.

Now, for the summary, I need to incorporate these words while summarizing the article. The article discusses Russia's consideration to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the potential economic gains from selling emission quotas, the scientific debate on the benefits and harms of global warming, and the moral implications of relying on market mechanisms versus sustainable development.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points: the meeting agenda, the Kyoto Protocol's goals, the debate on Russia's role, the economic implications, the scientific concerns, and the moral considerations about sustainability and environmental damage.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes as many of the identified moral words as possible without making it too forced. Also, keeping it concise is important, so I'll focus on the main arguments for and against ratification, the economic aspects, and the broader moral implications.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "ratification," "reduce," "global climatic strategy," "hopeful," "problem," "alarm," "consequences," "gain," "control," "threat," "obliged," "dominant," "advantageous," "rational," "sustainable," "damage," "harm," "destruction." I'll check each sentence to see if it naturally includes these words while conveying the article's content.

I should also ensure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll write a draft, then count the words to adjust if necessary. Finally, I'll make sure the summary captures the moral framing by highlighting the debate on benefits versus potential harms and the obligations and responsibilities involved.

**Summary:**
The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a global climatic strategy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While some view this as an advantageous opportunity for Russia to gain economically by selling emission quotas, others express alarm over the potential consequences of global warming. The debate highlights the threat to southern countries and the moral obligation to address climate change sustainably. Critics warn against relying solely on market mechanisms, emphasizing the need for rational development and environmental protection. The discussion underscores the dilemma between economic gain and the sustainable future of our planet, urging a balanced approach to avoid further harm and destruction. Ratification is seen as a step toward controlling emissions, yet the long-term implications and the damage to ecosystems remain a concern. END OF SUMMARY.
