Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Russia's consideration of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It mentions various experts' opinions, the potential economic gains for Russia, and the broader implications of global warming.

I should identify the morally framed words the author used, such as "reduce," "ratify," "control," "gain," "solve," and others. These words highlight the ethical and strategic aspects of the decision. I need to ensure these terms are included in the summary to maintain the moral context.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: the meeting agenda, expert discussions, Russia's potential role, economic benefits, concerns about environmental impact, and the debate over the Kyoto Protocol's effectiveness and costs.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the agenda and expert discussions, then move on to the arguments for and against ratification, including economic gains, environmental risks, and the necessity of international cooperation. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to reflect the ethical dimensions of the issue.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, connecting the main ideas without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. Experts and scientists have debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that the country could benefit economically by selling emission quotas, while others warn of the risks of inaction. The protocol, which assigns emission quotas to countries, has been ratified by over 40 nations, but without Russia and the US, its effectiveness is at risk. Discussions highlighted the moral obligation to address climate change, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and the potential consequences of failing to act. While some see opportunities for Russia to gain from the protocol, others caution against relying solely on economic gains, stressing the importance of sustainable development and environmental protection. The debate underscored the ethical dilemma of balancing economic interests with the global imperative to control climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
