SUMMARY: On the agenda for tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government is the question of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a critical international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Experts are divided on the potential impact of climate change on Russia, with some arguing that Russia could benefit from global warming due to increased agricultural productivity in previously frozen lands, while others emphasize the potential negative consequences such as the melting of glaciers and rising sea levels, which could inundate low-lying areas like St. Petersburg and Western Siberia. The roundtable discussion concluded that while models are imperfect, warming is undeniable and human contribution is significant. Russia has a significant role in the Kyoto Protocol as it holds a "controlling block of shares," and its ratification of the document is crucial. The Foreign Ministry recommends ratification, as integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU would have a more significant impact. Experts emphasize the need to adapt to climate change and express concern about proposals to block the sun or release cooling aerosols into the atmosphere, arguing that such interventions could cause further damage to the already fragile climate system.

END OF SUMMARY.
