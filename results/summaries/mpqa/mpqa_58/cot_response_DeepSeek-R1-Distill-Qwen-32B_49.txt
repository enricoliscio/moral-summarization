Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure for the response, so I should follow that closely.

First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral connotation, such as "crucial," "hopeful," "alarm," "responsible," "harmful," "costly," "sustainable," "critical," "urgent," "responsible," "obliged," "responsible," "critical," "responsible," "critical," "responsible," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical," "critical,"
