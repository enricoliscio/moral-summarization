SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts gathered to discuss Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to increased agricultural production in previously frozen regions. However, others countered that the benefits are overstated and that the country should prioritize environmental protection and energy efficiency. The Kyoto Protocol assigns countries quotas on their emissions, and Russia has already signed the document but has yet to ratify it. The country's emissions are almost twice as great as those of Germany and Japan, and it has the potential to offer significant carbon credits to the market. Experts agree that the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is costly, but its value lies in the fact that it ties implementation to the market mechanism, making it uneconomical to ignore environmental protection.

END OF SUMMARY.
