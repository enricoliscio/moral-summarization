SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated the issue, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming, while others believe it poses a significant threat. The country's emissions are currently 25% lower than in 1990, and it is not required to reduce them under the protocol. However, experts warn that climate change will have devastating effects on ecosystems, infrastructure, and human settlements. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change, and experts urge Russia to ratify it, citing the benefits of market mechanisms and international cooperation. The country's efforts will have a greater impact if integrated into the efforts of the European Union.
