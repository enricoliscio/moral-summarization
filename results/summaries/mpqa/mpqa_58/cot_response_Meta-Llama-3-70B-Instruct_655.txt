SUMMARY:
The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have been debating Russia's role in the global climatic strategy, with some arguing that the country will benefit from global warming. However, others have raised alarming concerns about the devastating impact of climate change on ecosystems and human societies. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change, but some experts have questioned the effectiveness of the document, citing its flaws and the need for a more comprehensive approach. Despite the challenges, the Foreign Ministry has recommended that the government move to ratify the protocol, citing its brilliant assessment that the impact of national efforts will be greater if they are integrated into the efforts of the EU.
