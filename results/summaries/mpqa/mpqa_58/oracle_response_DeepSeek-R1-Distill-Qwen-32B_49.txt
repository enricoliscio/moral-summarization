Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My job is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those moral terms as possible. 

First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about Russia considering ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, discussions among scientists and policymakers, and the implications of global warming. The article mentions different viewpoints on whether Russia should ratify, the potential economic benefits, and the environmental consequences.

Next, I should identify the key moral concepts from the provided list. Words like "reduce," "control," "solve," "gain," "threat," "protect," "emit," "damage," and "strive" are central here. These terms highlight the ethical dimensions of the issue, such as reducing emissions, controlling global warming, solving environmental problems, and the threat to ecosystems.

I need to ensure that the summary captures these moral elements. I'll start by mentioning the ratification discussion, the potential benefits for Russia, and the concerns about environmental damage. I'll also include the idea that without Russia's participation, the protocol might fail, emphasizing the moral responsibility.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the meeting agenda, moving through expert opinions, and concluding with the implications of ratification. I'll make sure to use the moral terms naturally within this flow without forcing them.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral framing. I'll also make sure to include the key points about the Kyoto Protocol's goals, Russia's role, and the potential consequences of inaction or action.

SUMMARY: The Russian government is considering ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. Scientists and policymakers have debated Russia's role in global climate strategy, with some arguing that the country could gain economically by selling emission quotas due to its current low emissions. However, others warn that global warming poses a threat to ecosystems, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in the Arctic and low-lying areas. The protocol's market-based mechanisms, such as trading emission quotas, have been criticized for potentially failing to drive technological innovation and environmental protection. Experts emphasize the need for integrated efforts, including nature conservation and reducing emissions, to address climate change effectively. Without Russia's participation, the protocol risks failing, as the country holds significant influence in the global climate strategy. The debate highlights the moral imperative to act responsibly to mitigate the effects of global warming and protect the planet for future generations. END OF SUMMARY.
