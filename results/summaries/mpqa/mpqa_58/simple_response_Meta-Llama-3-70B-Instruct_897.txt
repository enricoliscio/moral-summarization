SUMMARY:

The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and experts have debated the issue, with some arguing that Russia will benefit from global warming due to its vast territories and potential for agricultural production. However, others have warned that the consequences of climate change will be devastating, including the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, and disruption to ecosystems. The Kyoto Protocol provides for economic mechanisms of international cooperation, and Russia's obligations under the protocol are relatively mild. The country is not required to reduce emissions, but must maintain records of and monitor emissions and emission quotas. Experts have urged Russia to ratify the protocol, citing the benefits of integrating its efforts with those of the European Union. The Foreign Ministry has recommended ratification, emphasizing the importance of market mechanisms in addressing environmental issues.
