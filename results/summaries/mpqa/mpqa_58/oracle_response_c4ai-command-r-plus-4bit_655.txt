SUMMARY: The Russian government is set to discuss the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international document aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists debated Russia's role in global climatic strategy, with some arguing that Russia will gain from global warming due to increased agricultural productivity in permafrost regions. However, others highlighted the negative consequences for the southern countries and the need to control global warming. The discussion also focused on the economic opportunities for Russia in the carbon market and the potential for increased gas demand if other nations comply with the protocol. The Foreign Ministry recommended ratification, emphasizing the importance of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the EU. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, assigns countries quotas on emissions and allows for the trading of emission quotas. Russia's obligations under the protocol are relatively mild, as its emissions are already significantly below the baseline level. Experts warned that climate change will have severe impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure, and that human activities are causing irreversible damage to nature. Russia's ratification of the document is crucial for its success, given that the US has withdrawn from the accords.
