SUMMARY: Tomorrow, the Russian government will meet to decide whether to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol has already been signed by over 80 nations and ratified by almost 40. Russia, the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has a unique opportunity to benefit from the protocol's emission trading system, as it has a surplus of "hot air" or emission allowances. However, there are differing views on the potential impact of the protocol on Russia's economy and technology development. Some argue that Russia should focus on dealing in "hot air," while others believe that this will not provide the necessary impetus for technological advancement and will hinder Russia's efforts to strive for rational development. The article also discusses the potential impact of climate change on Russia's agriculture and ecosystems, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the consequences of global warming. Experts emphasize the need for a comprehensive understanding of past climate changes and the role of human activities in the current warming trend. Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is seen as a crucial step in addressing global climate change, and the article concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of integrating Russia's efforts with those of the European Union.
