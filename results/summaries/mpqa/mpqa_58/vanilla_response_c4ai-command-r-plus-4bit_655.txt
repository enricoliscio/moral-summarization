SUMMARY: The article discusses the upcoming meeting of the Russian government to decide on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol has been signed by over 80 nations and ratified by almost 40. Russia, which is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, signed the protocol in 1999 but has yet to ratify it. The article presents different views on the potential impact of the protocol on Russia, with some experts arguing that Russia could benefit economically from the trading of emission quotas, while others believe that Russia's efforts should focus on developing nature-conservation technologies. The article also highlights the potential risks of climate change, such as the melting of glaciers and the rise in sea levels, which could have devastating consequences for Russia's low-lying areas. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of Russia's role in global efforts to combat climate change and the potential benefits of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
