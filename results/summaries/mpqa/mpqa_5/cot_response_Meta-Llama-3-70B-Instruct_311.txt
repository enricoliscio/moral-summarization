SUMMARY:
Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the notion of "common values" between the two nations. He argued that "value sharing" is needed, rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing". Kono listed several US policies that he deemed "unacceptable", including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and the right to own handguns. He also mentioned the US stance on land mines and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono's criticism was met with interest from ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries, who sought his opinion on the President's speech. Overall, Kono emphasized the need for "true" cooperation and "acceptable" policies between Japan and the US.
