SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. In his daily email magazine, Kono expressed frustration with the President's words, particularly on the issues of the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and burden sharing. He felt that the US was not willing to share values, but instead was pushing its own interests, including rejecting the CTBT and Kyoto Protocol, allowing handgun ownership, and justifying land mines. Kono also mentioned that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries approached him after the speech, seeking his opinion. He implied that the US was not willing to compromise or consider other nations' perspectives, and that this approach was unacceptable.
