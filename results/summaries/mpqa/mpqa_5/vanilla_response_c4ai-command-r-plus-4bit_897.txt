SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a member of Japan's lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, published an article in his e-mail magazine, "Gomameno no Hagishiri," on February 19, 2003, where he criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling but expressed his disagreement with the US stance on several issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, BWC, handgun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono's article highlights the differing perspectives between the two countries on important global issues. Kono's e-mail magazine provides insight into the thoughts of a prominent Japanese politician and the potential implications for US-Japan relations.
