SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. Kono, a twice-elected Liberal Democratic Party member, wrote in his daily email magazine that he considered heckling the President during the speech, questioning the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT. Kono argued that the US prioritizes "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing" in its relationship with Japan. He listed several areas where the US and Japan disagree, including the CTBT, Kyoto Protocol, handgun ownership, land mines, and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono's criticism was met with interest from Middle Eastern ambassadors, who sought his opinion on the President's speech.
