SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the President's commitment to "common values". Kono refrained from heckling, but wondered aloud about the US stance on key issues, such as the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and handgun ownership. He lamented that the US seems to prioritize "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing" in its relationship with Japan. Kono also expressed dismay at the US position on land mines, the SOFA, and the proposed attack on Iraq. After the speech, ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought Kono's opinion, suggesting that his concerns resonated with others. By using phrases like "have the right to own", "attack together", and "have", Kono emphasized the moral implications of the US actions, highlighting the need for a more cooperative and value-driven approach.
