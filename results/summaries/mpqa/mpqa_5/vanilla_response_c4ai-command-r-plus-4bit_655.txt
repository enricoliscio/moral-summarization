SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, wrote a critical response to US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19th, 2003. In his email magazine, Kono expressed his disagreement with the President's stance on various international agreements and issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and the US-Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono believes that Japan and the US need to share values, not just burdens or power, and that there are significant differences between the two countries' positions on key issues. He refrained from heckling the President during the speech but later shared his thoughts with ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries who asked for his opinion. Kono's comments highlight a perspective that is critical of US foreign policy and emphasizes the need for value alignment in the Japan-US relationship.
