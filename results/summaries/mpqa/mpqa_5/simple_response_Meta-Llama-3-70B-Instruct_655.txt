SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the President's commitment to "common values." Kono refrained from heckling, but expressed his concerns in his email magazine, emphasizing the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He listed several areas where the US stance is unacceptable, including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and the ban on land mines. Kono also mentioned the US insistence on the right to own handguns and the need for a revised Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The moral framing of Kono's criticism is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the US is not living up to its professed values and is instead prioritizing its own interests over global cooperation and humanitarian concerns.
