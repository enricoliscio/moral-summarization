Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has specified that the words "have," "own," and "attack" should be included as they carry moral implications. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized President Bush's speech in the Diet. He felt the US was imposing its values, like gun ownership and attacking Iraq, which he finds problematic. 

I need to make sure the summary includes those three words. I'll structure the summary to highlight Kono's criticism, the specific policies he mentions (gun ownership, Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, Iraq attack), and the moral stance against these actions. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows naturally while including all necessary elements. I'll check the word count and make sure the moral framing is clear through the use of the specified words.

SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized U.S. President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on 19 February. In his email magazine, Kono expressed frustration with the U.S. stance on issues like the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and gun ownership rights. He argued that the U.S. emphasis on "common values" seemed hypocritical, as it prioritized "value sharing" over burden or power sharing. Kono highlighted the U.S. rejection of the CTBT, disregard for the BWC, and insistence on attacking Iraq as unacceptable. He noted that Middle Eastern ambassadors sought his reaction to the speech, underscoring the global implications of U.S. policies. Kono's critique centers on the moral and political disparities between the U.S. and Japan, particularly regarding issues like gun ownership and military action. END OF SUMMARY.
