SUMMARY:
Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the sincerity of the President's words on "common values". Kono felt that the US was not genuinely interested in "value sharing", instead pushing its own agenda, including rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and refusing to revise the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The President's stance on issues like handgun ownership and land mines was also deemed "unacceptable". Kono's concerns were shared by ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries, who sought his opinion on the speech. The article highlights the tension between the US and Japan on various issues, with Kono advocating for a more collaborative approach based on "true" shared values. END OF SUMMARY.
