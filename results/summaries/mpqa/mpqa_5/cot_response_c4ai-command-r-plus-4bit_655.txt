SUMMARY: Taro Kono, son of a former Foreign Minister and a twice-elected lower house Liberal Democratic Party member, offered a critique of US President Bush's speech to the Japanese Diet on February 19th. Kono's criticism centered around the apparent disconnect between Japan and the United States on several global issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, the CTBT, the BWC, and more. Kono felt that the President's use of the term "common values" rang hollow given the United States' positions on these matters, and he suggested that what was truly needed was "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing". Kono refrained from heckling the President during his speech but later expressed his concerns in his e-mail magazine, where he also noted that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries had sought his opinion on the President's address. Kono's comments highlight a moral dilemma and a potential rift in the Japan-US relationship, with the US position on international treaties, human rights, and military action in Iraq being deemed unacceptable and in contrast to shared values. END OF SUMMARY.
