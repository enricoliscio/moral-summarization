Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticizing President Bush's speech. He mentions things like the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and other treaties, which are all morally charged topics. He feels the US isn't sharing values but just wants burden sharing. 

First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally framed words. Words like 'critical,' 'heckling,' 'common values,' 'value sharing,' 'unacceptable,' 'right,' 'necessary,' 'attack,' and 'immediately' seem to carry moral weight. 

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Taro Kono and his criticism. Then, mention his thoughts on heckling and the issues he's concerned about, like the treaties. Highlight his stance on value sharing versus burden sharing. Finally, note the ambassadors' reaction. I need to make sure the summary flows naturally while including all the key moral points.

Kono highlighted the US's rejection of key treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT, arguing these decisions were unacceptable. He pointed out the US's stance on issues such as gun rights, land mines, and SOFA, expressing concern over the push for attacking Iraq.
