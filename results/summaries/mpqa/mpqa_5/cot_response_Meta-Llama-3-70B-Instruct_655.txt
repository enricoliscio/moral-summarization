SUMMARY:
Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the notion of "common values" between Japan and the US. He argued that "value sharing" is needed, not "burden sharing" or "power sharing". Kono listed several US policies that are "unacceptable", including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT, and the stance on handguns, land mines, and the SOFA. He implied that the US is not committed to "true" cooperation, and that its actions are not in line with "needed" values. Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought Kono's opinion on the President's speech, suggesting that his criticism resonated with others. END OF SUMMARY.
