SUMMARY: In his e-mail magazine, Taro Kono, son of a former Foreign Minister and a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party, shared his thoughts on US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono contemplated heckling the president with questions about the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT, but he refrained. He took issue with the president's use of the phrase "common values," arguing that what is truly needed in the Japan-US relationship is "value sharing." Kono highlighted several points of contention between the two countries, including the US's rejection of the CTBT and Kyoto Protocol, its stance on gun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA, and its desire to attack Iraq. He felt that these positions were unacceptable and reflected a lack of true "value sharing." Kono's comments underscore the complexities and moral dilemmas inherent in international relations, especially between two countries with seemingly divergent values. END OF SUMMARY.
