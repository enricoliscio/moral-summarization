SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, expressed his disappointment and frustration with US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the sincerity of his words on "common values." Instead, Kono emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He criticized the US stance on various issues, including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the right to own handguns, and the necessity of land mines. Kono found it unacceptable that the US expects Japan to attack Iraq together, and was approached by Middle Eastern ambassadors seeking his thoughts on the President's speech. Kono's critique highlights the moral disconnect between the US and Japan on these critical issues.
