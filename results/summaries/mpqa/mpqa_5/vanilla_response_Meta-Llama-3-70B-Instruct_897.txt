SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. Kono, a twice-elected lower house Liberal Democratic Party member, wrote in his daily email magazine that he was tempted to heckle the President about the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Kono argued that the US prioritizes "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing" in its relationship with Japan. He listed several US positions that he deemed unacceptable, including opposition to the CTBT and Kyoto Protocol, support for handgun ownership, and refusal to revise the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). After the speech, ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries approached Kono to ask his thoughts on the President's address.
