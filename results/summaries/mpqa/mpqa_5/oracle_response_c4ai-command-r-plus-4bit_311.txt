SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a prominent Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, wrote a critical response to US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet in February 2003. Kono, known for his e-mail magazine, expressed his disagreement with the President's stance on various global issues. He questioned the US position on the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and other matters such as gun ownership rights and the necessity of land mines. Kono felt that the US was imposing its values on Japan and that true "value sharing" between the two countries was lacking. He also highlighted the need for revision of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and expressed his hesitation to follow the US lead in a potential attack on Iraq. Kono's critique reflects a perspective that values mutual understanding and respect between nations, challenging the idea of unilateral imposition of values and policies. Kono's stance demonstrates a commitment to Japan's sovereignty and moral responsibility in global affairs.
