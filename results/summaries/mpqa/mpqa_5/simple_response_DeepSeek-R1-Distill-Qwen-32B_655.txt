Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing that the author, Taro Kono, presented. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

Taro Kono is the son of a former Foreign Minister and a Liberal Democratic Party member. He wrote a critical comment on President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. In his email magazine, he talks about his reaction to the speech. He mentions wanting to heckle but refrained. He questions the use of "common values" and argues that "value sharing" is more appropriate for the US-Japan relationship. He lists several points where the US stance is problematic, like the CTBT, BWC, Kyoto Protocol, gun rights, land mines, SOFA, and the Iraq attack. He also notes that Middle Eastern ambassadors approached him after the speech.

The user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should capture the moral critique Kono presents. I need to make sure to highlight his criticism of US policies and his emphasis on value sharing over burden or power sharing.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Kono and his critique, then outline the main points he makes about US policies, and finally mention the ambassadors' reaction. Keeping it concise while ensuring all key moral points are included is crucial.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll make sure to use the exact terms Kono used to maintain the moral framing, like "value sharing" and the specific policies he criticized. Also, I'll note the ambassadors' interest to show the international attention his critique received.
