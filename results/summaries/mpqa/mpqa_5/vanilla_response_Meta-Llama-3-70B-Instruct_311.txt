SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. Kono wrote in his email magazine that he was tempted to heckle the President about the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), but refrained. He argued that the US and Japan need to share values, not just burdens or power, and that the US's stance on various issues, including the CTBT, Kyoto Protocol, gun ownership, land mines, and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), is unacceptable. Kono also mentioned that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries approached him after the speech to ask for his thoughts. The article suggests that Kono is critical of the US's unilateral approach to international relations and its disregard for international agreements and treaties.
