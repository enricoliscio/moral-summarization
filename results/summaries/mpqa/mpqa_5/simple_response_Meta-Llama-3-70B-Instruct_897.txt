SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the authenticity of their shared "common values". Kono refrained from heckling, but expressed his disappointment in the US stance on various international issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and land mines. He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono's remarks highlight the moral dissonance between the two nations' values and priorities, suggesting that the US is more interested in pursuing its own interests than in genuinely collaborating with Japan.

END OF SUMMARY.
