SUMMARY: In his e-mail magazine, Taro Kono, a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling but took issue with several points, including the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the right to own handguns, the necessity of land mines, and the need to revise the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He also noted that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought his opinion on the President's speech. Kono's comments highlight a perspective that diverges from the US position on various global issues and treaties.
END OF SUMMARY.
