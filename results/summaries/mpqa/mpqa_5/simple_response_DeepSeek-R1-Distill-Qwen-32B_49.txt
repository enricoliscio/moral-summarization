Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and the son of a former foreign minister. He wrote a critical comment about President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono has an email magazine where he often shares his thoughts, and in this case, he's expressing his frustration with the US administration's policies.

He mentions several points where he disagrees with the US. First, he thought of heckling Bush during his speech, asking about the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT. He refrained but still felt strongly about it. He believes that the US-Japan relationship should be based on "value sharing" rather than sharing burdens or power. He lists several US policies he finds unacceptable: rejecting CTBT, ignoring the BWC, opposing the Kyoto Protocol, supporting gun rights, using land mines, not revising SOFA, and wanting to attack Iraq together. He also notes that Middle Eastern ambassadors approached him after the speech, probably concerned about Bush's stance.

The summary needs to capture Kono's criticism of the US administration, his emphasis on value sharing, and the specific policies he opposes. It should also mention the reaction from Middle Eastern ambassadors. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is preserved, highlighting the ethical concerns Kono has about the US's stance on international agreements and policies.

I'll structure the summary by introducing Kono, his criticism of Bush's speech, the policies he opposes, his view on the US-Japan relationship, and the ambassadors' reaction. I'll make sure to include all these elements concisely.
