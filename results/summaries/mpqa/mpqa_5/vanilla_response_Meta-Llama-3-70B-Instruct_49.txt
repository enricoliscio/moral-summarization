SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. In his daily email magazine, Kono expressed frustration with the President's stance on various issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and the right to own handguns. Kono argued that the US is not sharing values with Japan, but rather imposing its own views. He also mentioned that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries approached him after the speech to ask for his thoughts. Kono's comments reflect his dissatisfaction with the US's unilateral approach to international relations and its disregard for global treaties and agreements.
