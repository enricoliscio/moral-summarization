SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the values shared between the two nations. Kono refrained from heckling, but expressed his concerns about the US stance on various issues. He argued that the US prioritizes "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing," citing the country's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and its stance on handguns, land mines, and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono deemed these positions "not acceptable" and emphasized the need for genuine value sharing in the Japan-US relationship. The article highlights the moral disconnect between the two nations, with Kono implying that the US is more interested in exerting power and imposing its will than in collaborating and sharing values.
