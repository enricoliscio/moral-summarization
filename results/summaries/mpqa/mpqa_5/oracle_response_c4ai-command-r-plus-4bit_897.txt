SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, wrote a critical response to US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet in February 2003. In his email magazine, Kono expressed his disagreement with the US on several issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and the right to own handguns. He believed that Japan and the US needed to share values, not just burdens or power. Kono felt that the US position on international treaties and issues like land mines and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was unacceptable. He also questioned the decision to attack Iraq. Kono's comments reflect a moral stance on issues of ownership, action, and responsibility. He values international cooperation and believes in the importance of shared values and respect for international agreements. Kono's perspective challenges the US-Japan relationship and asserts Japan's right to have its own moral compass.
