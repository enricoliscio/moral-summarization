SUMMARY: During a speech by US President Bush to the Japanese Diet on February 19, Taro Kono, a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party, considered heckling the president with questions about the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT. Kono believes that "value sharing" is more important than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He criticizes the United States for its positions on various international agreements and issues, including the CTBT, the BWC, the Kyoto Protocol, handgun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. Kono also questions the US plan to attack Iraq. He feels that the US positions are at odds with the claim of "common values" and that a true sharing of values is needed between the two countries. Kono's comments reflect his own moral stance and sense of ownership over Japan's international stance.
END OF SUMMARY.
