Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user mentioned that the author used words like "have," "own," and "attack," so I should make sure those are included.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized President Bush's speech. He thought about heckling but didn't. He talks about the need for "value sharing" instead of burden or power sharing. He lists several U.S. policies he disagrees with, like the CTBT, BWC, Kyoto Protocol, gun rights, land mines, SOFA, and attacking Iraq. Middle Eastern ambassadors approached him after the speech.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Kono's criticism, his thoughts on heckling, the concept of value sharing, and the specific policies he opposes. Also, include that ambassadors asked him about the speech.

I should use the morally framed words: "have," "own," "attack." So I'll make sure those verbs are present where appropriate. For example, "the U.S. claims citizens have the right to own handguns" and "attack Iraq together."

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: introduce Kono, his criticism, his thoughts, the need for value sharing, list the policies, and the ambassadors' reaction.

Let me draft it:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized President Bush's speech, considering heckling but refraining. He emphasizes the need for "value sharing" in the US-Japan relationship. Kono opposes U.S. policies, including the rejection of CTBT, disregard for BWC, opposition to Kyoto Protocol, support for gun ownership, land mines, unaltered SOFA, and plans to attack Iraq. Middle Eastern ambassadors sought his opinion on the speech.

Wait, that's a bit short. I should add more details to reach up to 200 words without being too lengthy. Maybe include that Kono's comments were in his email magazine and that he issues it almost daily.

Finalizing the summary to include all key points, the moral words, and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, criticized President Bush's speech during the Japanese Diet on 19 February. In his e-mail magazine, Gomameno no Hagishiri, Kono expressed frustration with the U.S. stance on various issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and gun ownership rights. He questioned the notion of "common values" and emphasized the need for "value sharing" in the U.S.-Japan relationship. Kono opposed U.S. policies such as the rejection of the CTBT, disregard for the BWC, opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, support for citizens owning handguns, and the use of land mines. He also criticized plans to attack Iraq without revising the SOFA. After the speech, ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries approached Kono to discuss his views. Kono's critique highlights the moral and political tensions between the U.S. and Japan. END OF SUMMARY.
