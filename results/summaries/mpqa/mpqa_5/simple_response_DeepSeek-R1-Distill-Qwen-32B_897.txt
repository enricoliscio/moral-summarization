Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary, under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticizing President Bush's speech. He's questioning the US's stance on various treaties and policies, like the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and others. He's emphasizing the need for 'value sharing' over just burden or power sharing.

I should highlight Kono's main points: his criticism of Bush's speech, the specific issues he raises, and his stance on the US-Japan relationship. Also, mention that Middle Eastern ambassadors were interested in his views.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral perspective, showing Kono's disapproval of the US's approach and his emphasis on shared values. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to include the key points without going into too much detail.

Let me draft it: mention Kono's background, his criticism, the specific treaties, his emphasis on value sharing, and the reaction from the ambassadors. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

He emphasized the need for a "value sharing" approach in the US-Japan relationship, rather than focusing solely on burden or power sharing. Kono also highlighted the US's rejection of various treaties and policies, including the right to own handguns, the necessity of land mines, and the need for no changes to the SOFA. His critique drew attention, as Middle Eastern ambassadors sought his opinion on the President's speech. Kono's commentary reflects a moral stance on the importance of shared values in international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
