Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Taro Kono, who is the son of a former Japanese Foreign Minister and a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He wrote a critical comment about President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19th.

He published this in his email magazine, Gomameno no Hagishiri, which he sends almost daily. In his comment, he mentions thinking about heckling the president with questions about the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT but held back. He argues that the US-Japan relationship should be based on "value sharing" rather than burden or power sharing. He lists several US policies he disagrees with, like rejecting CTBT, ignoring BWC, opposing Kyoto Protocol, supporting gun rights, land mines, and not revising SOFA. He also mentions Middle Eastern ambassadors asking him about the speech.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main points: who Taro Kono is, his criticism of Bush's speech, his emphasis on value sharing, the policies he opposes, and the ambassadors' reaction. I should make sure to mention the email magazine and that his summary is based on foreign media without US government coordination.

I need to structure it clearly, maybe starting with Kono's background, his critique, the specific points he made, and the aftermath with the ambassadors. Keeping it concise but covering all key aspects. I'll avoid any markdown and just write a straightforward summary.

He criticized U.S. policies, including opposition to the CTBT, disregard for the BWC, rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, support for gun rights, land mines, and SOFA unchanged. Middle Eastern ambassadors sought his opinion on the speech. Kono's analysis is based on foreign media reports without U.S. government input. END OF SUMMARY.
