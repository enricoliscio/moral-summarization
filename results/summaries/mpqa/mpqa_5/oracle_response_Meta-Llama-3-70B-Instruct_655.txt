SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the values shared between the two nations. Kono refrained from heckling, but felt compelled to speak out against the US stance on various issues. He argued that the US prioritizes "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing," citing the US rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and BWC. Kono also highlighted the US stance on handguns, land mines, and the SOFA, which he deemed unacceptable. The US push for a joint attack on Iraq was the final straw. Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought Kono's opinion on the President's speech, implying that the US stance is not universally accepted.

END OF SUMMARY.
