SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the notion of "common values" between the two nations. He argued that "value sharing" is needed, not "burden sharing" or "power sharing". Kono highlighted the US stance on various issues, including rejecting the CTBT, dismissing the BWC, opposing the Kyoto Protocol, and advocating for citizens' right to "own" handguns. He also mentioned the US position on land mines and the SOFA, concluding that these views are "not acceptable". The article implies that the US is pushing its own interests, rather than truly sharing values or seeking cooperation. Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought Kono's opinion on the President's speech, suggesting that his criticism resonated with others.

END OF SUMMARY.
