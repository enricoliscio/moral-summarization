SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, expressed criticism towards US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the notion of "common values" between Japan and the US. He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in their relationship. Kono highlighted the US's stance on various issues, including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), as well as its support for handgun ownership and land mines. He deemed these positions unacceptable and was approached by Middle Eastern ambassadors seeking his thoughts on the President's speech. Kono's critique underscores the importance of shared values and cooperation in international relations.
