Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Taro Kono criticizing President Bush's speech. The user specified that I need to keep the morally framed words: "have," "own," and "attack." 

First, I'll read the article to understand the context. Taro Kono is a Japanese politician who wrote a critical comment on Bush's speech. He mentions several points where he disagrees with the US stance, like the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, and more. He also talks about the US's positions on issues like gun ownership, land mines, SOFA, and attacking Iraq.

I need to make sure the summary includes these morally framed words. So, I'll structure the summary to highlight Kono's criticism and the specific points where he uses those words. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the essence of his argument.

I'll start by introducing Kono and his criticism. Then, I'll list the issues he brings up, making sure to include "have," "own," and "attack." I'll also note that Middle Eastern ambassadors reached out to him, showing the international attention his critique received.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and includes all necessary points with the moral framing intact. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll format it with "SUMMARY:" at the start and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.
