SUMMARY: In a recent email magazine publication, Taro Kono, a prominent Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, offered a critical perspective on US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from openly heckling the President but expressed his disagreement with several aspects of US policy, including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono highlighted the divergence between Japanese and American values, particularly regarding gun ownership, land mines, and the interpretation of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). He also questioned the US push to attack Iraq, showcasing a nuanced perspective on international affairs that considers the viewpoints of Middle Eastern countries. Kono's comments reflect a thoughtful approach to foreign relations that prioritizes shared values and moral consistency.
