SUMMARY:
Taro Kono, a Japanese politician, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the sincerity of the President's words on "common values". Kono felt the urge to heckle, asking about the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT, but refrained. He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono listed several US positions that he deemed "unacceptable", including the rejection of the CTBT, the right to own handguns, and the necessity of land mines. He concluded that the US demands, such as attacking Iraq together, are not "acceptable". Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought Kono's thoughts on the President's speech. END OF SUMMARY.
