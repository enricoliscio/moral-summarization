SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, highlighting key areas of divergence between Japan and the US. Kono refrained from heckling but later expressed his concerns in his e-mail magazine, emphasizing the need for "value sharing" over "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He pointed out several disagreements between the two countries, including the US's rejection of the CTBT, BWC, and Kyoto Protocol, as well as its stance on handgun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. Kono's comments reflect a moral stance on these issues, suggesting that the US's positions are unacceptable and that a true partnership requires shared values. His perspective also draws attention to the potential diplomatic challenges and the need for careful navigation of these differing viewpoints in the Japan-US alliance. Kono's remarks underscore the complexities and moral dimensions inherent in international relations.

END OF SUMMARY.
