SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, wrote a critical response to US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono felt that the President's use of the term "common values" rang hollow given the United States' stance on various international agreements and issues, including the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and gun control. Kono believes that Japan and the United States need to focus on "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing." He refrained from heckling the President during the speech but later shared his thoughts in his e-mail magazine, expressing his disagreement with the US position on issues such as the Iraq attack, land mines, and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Kono's comments highlight a moral tension between the two countries' values and priorities, and he received immediate inquiries from Middle Eastern ambassadors seeking his perspective on the President's speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
