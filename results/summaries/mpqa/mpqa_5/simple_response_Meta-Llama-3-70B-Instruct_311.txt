SUMMARY:

Japanese politician Taro Kono, son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, questioning the sincerity of the President's words on "common values". Kono felt the urge to heckle the President, asking about the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT. Instead, he wrote in his daily email magazine, expressing his disappointment with the US's rejection of international agreements and treaties, such as the CTBT, Kyoto Protocol, and banning land mines. Kono argued that the US prioritizes its own interests over shared values, exemplified by its stance on handgun ownership and the need for land mines. He concluded that the US's approach is unacceptable and that Japan-US relations require "value sharing", not just "burden sharing" or "power sharing". Kono's critique reflects a moral imperative for international cooperation and respect for global agreements.
