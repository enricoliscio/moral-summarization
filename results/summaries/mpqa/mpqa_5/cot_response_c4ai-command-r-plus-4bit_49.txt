SUMMARY:
In his e-mail magazine, Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, offers a *critical* perspective on US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono contemplates *resisting* by heckling the President with questions about the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT. He emphasizes the need for "value *sharing*" over "burden *sharing*" or "power *sharing*" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono highlights several points of contention between the US and other countries, including the CTBT, BWC, Kyoto Protocol, handgun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. He finds the US position on these issues *unacceptable*. Kono's comments reflect a concern for maintaining shared *values* and principles in international relations. Middle Eastern *ambassadors* approach Kono seeking his perspective on the President's speech, underscoring the impact and implications of US foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
