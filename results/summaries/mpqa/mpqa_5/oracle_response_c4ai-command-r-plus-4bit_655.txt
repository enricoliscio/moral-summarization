SUMMARY: During his speech to the Japanese Diet, United States President Bush promoted a vision of "common values" between the two nations. However, Japanese politician Taro Kono criticized the President's remarks, arguing that there is a disconnect between the values espoused by the United States and its actions on several international agreements and issues. Kono highlighted the United States' rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as its stance on gun ownership rights, land mines, and the Status of Forces Agreement. Kono believes that true "value sharing" between Japan and the United States requires more alignment on these issues and that merely sharing "burden" or "power" is insufficient. Kono's comments reflect a perspective that the United States' actions do not align with the values it claims to uphold. This article also notes the interest of Middle Eastern ambassadors in Kono's perspective on the President's speech, suggesting broader implications and interpretations. END OF SUMMARY.
