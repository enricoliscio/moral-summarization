Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Taro Kono's critique of President Bush's speech. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions Taro Kono is the son of a former Foreign Minister and a twice-elected LDP member. He wrote a critical comment on Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet on February 19. He has an email magazine called "Gomameno no Hagishiri," which he publishes almost daily.

In his critique, Kono mentions thinking of heckling Bush but refrained. He questions Bush's use of "common values" and argues that "value sharing" is more important for the US-Japan relationship. He lists several US policies that Japan shouldn't accept, like rejecting CTBT, ignoring BWC, opposing Kyoto Protocol, supporting gun rights, using land mines, not revising SOFA, and attacking Iraq together. He also notes that Middle Eastern ambassadors approached him after the speech.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main points: Kono's background, his critique, the specific issues he raises, and the reaction from ambassadors. I should mention the email magazine and the main arguments he made against Bush's policies. I'll make sure to include that Kono believes in value sharing and lists the policies he opposes. Also, the fact that ambassadors approached him shows the speech's impact.

I should structure it clearly, starting with who Kono is, his critique, the points he made, and the reaction. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details. I need to ensure the summary is accurate and captures the essence of Kono's arguments against Bush's stance on various international issues and policies.
