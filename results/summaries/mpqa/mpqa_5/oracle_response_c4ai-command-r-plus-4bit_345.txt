SUMMARY: Lower house Liberal Democratic Party member Taro Kono criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet, expressing disagreement with US policies on various international agreements and issues. Kono highlighted the disconnect between the President's mention of "common values" and the US stance on the CTBT, BWC, Kyoto Protocol, handgun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. Kono felt the urge to heckle the President but refrained, later engaging in discussions with ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries who sought his thoughts on the speech. Kono's comments shed light on the differing values and priorities between Japan and the US, emphasizing the need for "value sharing" over "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in their relationship. Kono's moral framing of "have" and "own" in the context of handgun ownership and the right to "attack" Iraq reflects his perspective on the complex dynamics of international relations and the ethical implications of US policies. END OF SUMMARY.
