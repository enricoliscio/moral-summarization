Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read it carefully first.

The article is about Taro Kono, a Japanese politician. He's the son of a former Foreign Minister and a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. On February 19, he published a critical comment about President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. The comment was in his email magazine called "Gomameno no Hagishiri."

In his article, Kono talks about his thoughts during Bush's speech. He mentions wanting to heckle but holding back. He questions the use of "common values" and argues that "value sharing" is more important for the US-Japan relationship. He lists several points where the US stance differs from Japan's, like the CTBT, BWC, Kyoto Protocol, gun rights, land mines, SOFA, and the Iraq attack. Kono finds these positions unacceptable. After the speech, Middle Eastern ambassadors approached him to get his thoughts.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should include Kono's background, his criticism, the specific issues he mentions, and the ambassadors' reaction.

I'll structure it by introducing Kono, his criticism, the key points he made, and the aftermath. I need to make sure it's clear and within the word limit. Let me put it together step by step.
