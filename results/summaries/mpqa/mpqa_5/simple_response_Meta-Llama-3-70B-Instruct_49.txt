SUMMARY:

Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, expressed criticism towards US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono felt the urge to heckle the President, questioning his stance on the Kyoto Protocol and CTBT. He argued that the US prioritizes "burden sharing" and "power sharing" over "value sharing" in its relationship with Japan. Kono listed several US policies that he deemed unacceptable, including the rejection of the CTBT, the promotion of handgun ownership, and the justification of land mines. He also mentioned that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought his opinion on the President's speech. Kono's criticism highlights the moral discrepancy between the US's proclaimed "common values" and its actual policies, which prioritize national interests over global cooperation and human well-being.
