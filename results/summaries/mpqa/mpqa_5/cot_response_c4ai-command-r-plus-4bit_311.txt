SUMMARY: Taro Kono, son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party, wrote a piece criticizing US President Bush's speech to the Japanese Diet on February 19. Kono's article, published in his e-mail magazine "Gomameno no Hagishiri," highlights the moral discrepancies between Japan and the United States on several global issues. Kono refrained from *heckling* the president but later expressed his concerns. He questions the *sharing* of *values* between the two nations, citing American positions on treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT, as well as issues like gun ownership, land mines, and the SOFA. Kono believes that Japan and the US need to focus on *sharing values* rather than burdens or power. He also mentions the immediate response from Middle Eastern *ambassadors* seeking his thoughts on the president's speech, indicating the international implications of such moral disagreements. Kono's resistance to certain US policies showcases his commitment to upholding different ethical standards. END OF SUMMARY.
