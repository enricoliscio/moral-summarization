SUMMARY: In a recent email magazine publication, Taro Kono, a prominent Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, offered a critical perspective on US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling but expressed his disagreement with several aspects of US policy, including the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, the CTBT, and the BWC. He emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. Kono questioned the US stance on issues such as gun ownership rights, the necessity of land mines, and the revision of the SOFA. He also highlighted the divergence in views on attacking Iraq. Kono's comments reflect a moral framework centered on international cooperation, environmental protection, and a divergence in values between Japan and the US. Kono's stance drew immediate interest from Middle Eastern ambassadors, underscoring the significance of his perspective in the broader geopolitical context. Kono's critique underscores the complexities and moral dimensions inherent in global affairs.
