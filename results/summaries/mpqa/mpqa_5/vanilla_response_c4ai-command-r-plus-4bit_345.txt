SUMMARY: Taro Kono, a member of the lower house of the Liberal Democratic Party and son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, published an article in his e-mail magazine, "Gomameno no Hagishiri," on February 19, 2003, critiquing US President George W. Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono considered heckling the President with questions about the Kyoto Protocol and the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty), but refrained. He disagreed with the President's stance on various issues, including the CTBT, the BWC (Biological Weapons Convention), the Kyoto Protocol, gun ownership rights, land mines, and the need to revise the SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement). Kono emphasized the need for "value sharing" rather than "burden sharing" or "power sharing" in the Japan-US relationship. He also mentioned that ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought his opinion on the President's speech. Kono's article highlights a perspective that diverges from the US government's position and underscores the importance of shared values in international relations.
END OF SUMMARY.
