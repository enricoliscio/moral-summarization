SUMMARY:
Taro Kono, a Japanese politician and son of a former Foreign Minister, criticized US President Bush's speech before the Japanese Diet. Kono refrained from heckling the President, but questioned the sincerity of his words on "common values". Kono argued that what is needed is "value sharing", not "burden sharing" or "power sharing", in the Japan-US relationship. He listed several instances where the US stance is "unacceptable", including its rejection of the CTBT, Kyoto Protocol, and revision of the SOFA. Kono also mentioned the US position on handguns, land mines, and the Iraq war. Ambassadors from Middle Eastern countries sought his opinion on the President's speech. Kono's critique highlights the importance of "true" cooperation and "needed" changes in the relationship between the two nations. END OF SUMMARY.
