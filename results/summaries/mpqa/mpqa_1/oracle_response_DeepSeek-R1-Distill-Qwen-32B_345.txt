Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas emissions and the Kyoto Protocol. The author used words like "fighting" and "adopt," so I should include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article again to get the main points. President Cardoso of Brazil doesn't think the US will interfere in the negotiations. He believes the US is committed to fighting the problem, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil is sending a message to their congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters, with the US leading at 36%.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere. Then, I'll note Cardoso's belief that the US is committed to fighting the issue and will adopt measures despite renouncing Kyoto. I'll include Brazil's move to ratify the protocol and their emission reduction target. Finally, I'll mention the US's significant contribution to greenhouse gases.

I should make sure to use the morally framed words "fighting" and "adopt." Also, I need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it properly after the "SUMMARY:" token, ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me put it all together, ensuring it's clear and concise while retaining the moral language.
