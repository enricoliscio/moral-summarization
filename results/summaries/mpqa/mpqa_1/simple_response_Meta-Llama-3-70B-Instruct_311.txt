SUMMARY:

Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere with international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil has committed to reducing its greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The move is morally significant, as Brazil takes a proactive stance in addressing the critical issue of climate change. The world's largest emitters, including the US, Russia, and Japan, must also take responsibility for their actions and follow suit. It is morally imperative that nations work together to combat this global problem.

END OF SUMMARY.
