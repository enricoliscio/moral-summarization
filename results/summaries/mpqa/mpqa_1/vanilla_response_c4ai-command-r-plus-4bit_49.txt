SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso's remarks came as he urged Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and committed Brazil to reducing emissions. Brazil's commitment involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Cardoso believes that the US, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will adopt domestic measures to combat the problem, despite not being a part of the Kyoto agreement. He emphasized the importance of global cooperation in addressing this issue, highlighting the contributions of other major emitting countries, including Russia, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, Italy, Poland, and France.
