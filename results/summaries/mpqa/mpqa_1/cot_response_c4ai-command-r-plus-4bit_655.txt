STEP 1:
* committed
* fighting
* reducing

SUMMARY:
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the US remains *committed* to joining global efforts in *fighting* the problem and will take domestic measures. In a message to Congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The United States, as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions, has a significant role in addressing this global issue. Brazil's commitment to the protocol demonstrates its dedication to being part of the solution, urging other nations to follow suit in tackling climate change.
