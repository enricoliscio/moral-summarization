SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to combat the greenhouse effect. He believes the US is committed to fighting this global problem and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso's remarks came as he urged congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, pledging Brazil to reduce its greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US is currently the largest contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions. Other top emitters include Russia, Japan, Germany, and Great Britain. By taking action, Brazil and other nations can work together to fight this critical environmental issue. END OF SUMMARY.
