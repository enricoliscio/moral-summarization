Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break this down.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. That means I need to look for words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. Words like "interfere," "commitment," "fighting," "formally renounced," and "ratification" come to mind. These words imply actions that are either good or bad in a moral sense.

Next, I need to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include those morally charged words. I have to make sure the summary captures the essence of the article without losing the moral perspective. 

Looking at the article, President Cardoso is expressing hope that the US won't interfere in negotiations. He believes the US is committed to fighting greenhouse emissions, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil is taking steps to ratify the protocol and reduce emissions. The US is the largest emitter, which adds a moral weight to their actions.

I should structure the summary to highlight Brazil's stance, Cardoso's optimism about the US's commitment, and the mention of other top emitters. This way, the moral framing is preserved, emphasizing cooperation and responsibility in tackling climate change.

I also need to ensure that the summary is clear and flows well, using the identified morally framed words appropriately. Let me piece this together, making sure it's within the word limit and effectively conveys the moral aspects as per the user's request.
