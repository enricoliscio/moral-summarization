SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the US will not interfere with international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite the US formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In contrast, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This move is particularly noteworthy given that the US is the world's largest contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of emissions. The moral imperative to address climate change is clear, and Brazil's leadership on this issue serves as a positive example for other nations to follow.
