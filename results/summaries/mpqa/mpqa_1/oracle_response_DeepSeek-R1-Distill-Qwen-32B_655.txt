Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. 

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas negotiations and President Cardoso's comments on the US's involvement. The author used words like "fighting" and "adopt," which have a moral connotation. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The user wants the summary to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I should extract the key points: Brazil's call to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the reduction target, the US's commitment despite renouncing the protocol, and the mention of the top greenhouse gas emitters.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved. So, using words like "fighting" and "adopt" is crucial. I'll structure the summary to include Brazil's message, the US's stance, and the global context of emissions.

Let me check the word count as I draft it. I'll keep each sentence clear and to the point, making sure not to exceed 200 words. Also, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Brazil's action, then the US's commitment, and ending with the global statistics.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring all the key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed confidence that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions. He emphasized that the US is committed to joining global efforts to fight the problem, even though it has formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso sent a message to Congress urging Brazil to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by Russia, Japan, Germany, and others. Brazil's stance reflects a broader call for international cooperation in addressing climate change.  
END OF SUMMARY.
