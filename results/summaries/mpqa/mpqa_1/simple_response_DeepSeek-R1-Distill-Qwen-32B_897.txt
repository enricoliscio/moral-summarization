Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the text first. The article is about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas negotiations and the US's involvement. President Cardoso is hopeful that the US won't interfere and believes the US is committed to fighting the issue despite renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. He also sent a message to Congress for Brazil to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters.

The moral framing here seems to be about international cooperation and responsibility. Brazil is taking a proactive stance, while the US's stance is a bit conflictingâ€”renouncing the protocol but still committed domestically. I should highlight Brazil's leadership and the US's dual position. Also, emphasizing the statistics about emissions could show the urgency and the need for cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Brazil's hope regarding the US not interfering, mention Cardoso's belief in US commitment despite renouncing Kyoto. Then, include the ratification message and Brazil's target. Finally, list the major emitters to stress the global issue. I should keep the tone positive on Brazil's part but also note the US's mixed signals. That should cover the moral aspects without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed confidence that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the U.S. formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the country remains committed to addressing the issue through domestic measures. Cardoso's remarks came as he urged Brazil's Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases include the United States (36%), Russia (17.4%), and other major industrialized nations. Brazil's stance reflects a call for global cooperation in tackling climate change, emphasizing the need for collective action despite individual nations' differing approaches. END OF SUMMARY.
