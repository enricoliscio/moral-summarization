Alright, so I need to help the user with summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user provided a news article about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and US involvement. They want me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary using those words.

In STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "interfere," "commitment," "fighting," "problem," "formally renounced," and "ratification" come to mind. These words suggest actions or attitudes that have moral implications, like interference being negative and commitment being positive.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into a concise version, making sure to include as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll need to mention Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere, President Cardoso's belief in US commitment, the US's stance on the Kyoto Protocol, and Brazil's own commitment to reducing emissions. Also, including the statistics about greenhouse gas sources adds context.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: Brazil's hope, Cardoso's remarks, the US's position, Brazil's actions, and the global context with emission percentages. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate to maintain the original moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check that each key point is covered and that the moral terms are preserved. Once done, I'll review to make sure it's concise and meets all the user's requirements.

* fighting  
* problem  
* formally renounced  
* ratification

**SUMMARY:**  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed hope that the United States would not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions. He emphasized the US's commitment to joining global efforts to address the problem, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso's remarks came as he urged Brazil's congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US, while not part of the Kyoto Protocol, is seen as a key player in global efforts, given its status as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, responsible for 36% of global emissions. Other major contributors include Russia, Japan, and Germany. END OF SUMMARY.
