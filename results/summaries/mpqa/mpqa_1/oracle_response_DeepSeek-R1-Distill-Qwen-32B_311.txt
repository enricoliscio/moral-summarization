Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user specified that I should keep the words "fighting" and "adopt" as they are. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and the US's involvement. President Cardoso is hopeful the US won't interfere and believes they're committed to fighting greenhouse gases, even though they've renounced the protocol. Brazil is ratifying the protocol and aims to reduce emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes the moral words. I'll start by mentioning Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere. Then, I'll include Cardoso's belief that the US is fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures. I'll note Brazil's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and their reduction target. Finally, I'll list the major emitters to provide context.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure to include all key points and the specified moral terms.
