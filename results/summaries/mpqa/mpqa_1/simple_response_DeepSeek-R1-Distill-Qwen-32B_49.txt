Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and their hopes that the US won't interfere in greenhouse gas negotiations. President Cardoso is mentioned, and he's expressing confidence that the US is committed despite their formal withdrawal.

Now, the user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing. That means I should highlight the moral implications, like Brazil's leadership in environmental efforts and the US's potential influence. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective on the US's role and Brazil's proactive stance.

I should also keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Brazil's call for ratification, Cardoso's comments on the US, and the statistics on greenhouse gas emissions. I need to ensure that the moral aspect is clear, showing Brazil's commitment and the US's dual role.

I'll structure the summary to first state Brazil's action, then Cardoso's remarks about the US, followed by the global emissions data, and conclude with the implications. This should capture the essence and the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY:  
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed confidence that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso emphasized that the US is committed to addressing the issue through domestic measures and joining global efforts. He made these remarks while urging Brazil's Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US remains the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions, followed by Russia at 17.4%, and other major economies. Brazil's stance highlights its proactive role in combating climate change, while underscoring the moral responsibility of major emitters like the US to contribute to global solutions.  
END OF SUMMARY.
