Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and highlighted the morally framed words "fighting" and "adopt." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Cardoso of Brazil is hopeful that the US won't interfere in greenhouse gas negotiations. He believes the US is committed to joining other nations in fighting the problem, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. He's urging Brazil to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters.

I should include the key points: Brazil's stance, Cardoso's belief in US commitment, the call for ratification, and the statistics on emissions. I need to use "fighting" and "adopt" as they are morally charged words. 

I'll structure the summary to mention Brazil's hope, the US's commitment despite the protocol renunciation, the domestic measures, and the statistics. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the required tokens.

Let me draft it: Start with Brazil's hope, mention Cardoso's belief in the US fighting the problem, their commitment despite renouncing Kyoto, the domestic measures, the ratification call, and the emission stats. 

I should check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me count the words after drafting. It looks good. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words appropriately and keep the summary clear and to the point.

The US remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by Russia, Japan, Germany, and others. END OF SUMMARY.
