Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to keep: "fighting" and "adopt." 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and the US's role. President Cardoso believes the US won't interfere and is committed to fighting the problem, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. He sent a message to congress about ratifying the protocol and reducing emissions. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters.

I need to make sure the summary includes "fighting" and "adopt." I'll start by noting Brazil's support for the Kyoto Protocol. Then mention Cardoso's belief that the US is committed to fighting the issue, even without the protocol. I'll include that the US will adopt domestic measures. Also, highlight Brazil's commitment to reducing emissions. Finally, mention the leading emitters to show the context.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral terms are present. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all points are covered without losing the moral framing.

The world's largest contributors to greenhouse gases include the United States (36%), Russia (17.4%), Japan (8.5%), and others. END OF SUMMARY.
