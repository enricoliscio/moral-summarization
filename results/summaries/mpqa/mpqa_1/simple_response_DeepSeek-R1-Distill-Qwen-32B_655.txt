Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and their expectations regarding the US's involvement. President Cardoso doesn't think the US will interfere in the negotiations. He believes the US is committed to fighting greenhouse gas emissions, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil is sending a message to Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters, with the US leading at 36%.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about international cooperation and responsibility. The US's decision to renounce the Kyoto Protocol is framed negatively, implying a lack of commitment. Brazil's proactive stance is positive, showing leadership in combating climate change. The mention of other countries' emissions highlights the global nature of the problem and the importance of each country's role.

I need to make sure the summary captures this. It should mention Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere, Cardoso's belief in US commitment despite renouncing Kyoto, Brazil's own commitment, and the list of top emitters to emphasize the global issue.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Also, the summary should maintain the moral perspective, so I'll focus on the cooperative efforts and the US's perceived lack of action.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US remains committed to addressing the issue through domestic measures. Brazil has sent a message to its Congress urging ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing to a 5.2% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2012. The article highlights the global nature of the problem, noting that the US is the largest emitter, accounting for 36% of greenhouse gases, followed by Russia, Japan, and others. The moral framing emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the need for all nations, especially major emitters, to take responsibility in combating climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
