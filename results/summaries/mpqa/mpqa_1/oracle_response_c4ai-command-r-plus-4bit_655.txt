SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the US remains committed to joining the global fight against climate change and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In a message to congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Brazil's stance demonstrates its commitment to adopting measures that address the world's biggest sources of greenhouse gases, with the United States contributing the highest percentage of emissions. Cardoso's statement highlights the moral imperative of nations to work together in fighting climate change, regardless of formal agreements.
