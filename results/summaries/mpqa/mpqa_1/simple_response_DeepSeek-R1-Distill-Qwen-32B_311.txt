Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and US involvement. The key points are President Cardoso's belief that the US won't interfere in negotiations, despite having renounced the Kyoto Protocol. He also mentions the US's commitment to domestic measures. Brazil is ratifying the protocol and aims to reduce emissions by 5.2%. The US is the top emitter, so their actions are crucial. I should highlight the moral responsibility and the importance of global cooperation. Keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed confidence that the United States will not hinder international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite its formal renunciation of the Kyoto Protocol. He emphasized the US's commitment to combating climate change through domestic measures, aligning with global efforts. Cardoso's remarks came as he urged Brazil's Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, committing Brazil to a 5.2% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2012. The US, as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, remains a critical player in addressing this global moral imperative. END OF SUMMARY.
