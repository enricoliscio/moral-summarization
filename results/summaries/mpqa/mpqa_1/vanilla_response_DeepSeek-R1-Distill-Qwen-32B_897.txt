Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas negotiations and the US's role. President Cardoso is hopeful that the US won't interfere in international talks. He mentions that the US has renounced the Kyoto Protocol but still thinks they're committed to fighting the issue domestically.

Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the main points: Brazil's support for the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso's belief in the US's commitment despite their stance on the Protocol, and the statistics on greenhouse gas emissions by country.

I should also note that Brazil is taking action by ratifying the Protocol and aiming to reduce emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and structured clearly. Let me make sure to highlight Brazil's message to the US and the key players in emissions.

Alright, putting it all together: start with Brazil's position, mention Cardoso's comments on the US, include the emissions stats briefly, and end with Brazil's commitment. That should cover the essential points succinctly.

Despite the U.S. having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the country remains committed to addressing the issue through domestic measures. Brazil, meanwhile, has sent a message to its congress advocating for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The world's largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions include the United States (36%), Russia (17.4%), Japan (8.5%), Germany (7.4%), and others. END OF SUMMARY.
