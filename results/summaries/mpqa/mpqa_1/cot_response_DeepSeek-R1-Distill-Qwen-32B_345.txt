Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand the query.

The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all the single words with moral framing in the article, and second, write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and the US's role. I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "interfere," "committed," "fighting," "problem," "domestic measures," "formally renounced," "ratification," and "committing" seem to have moral implications. These words suggest actions that are either positive or negative in the context of environmental responsibility.

Next, I need to write a summary that's under 200 words. I should include these morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective. The summary should highlight Brazil's support for the Kyoto Protocol, the US's stance despite not ratifying it, and the global emissions context.

I'll start by mentioning President Cardoso's belief that the US won't interfere, their commitment to fighting emissions, and the domestic measures. Then, I'll note Brazil's ratification message and the emissions percentages to show the global picture.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it: mention Brazil's hope, the US's actions, Brazil's own commitment, and the global context. That should cover all key points with the moral words included.

**STEP 1:**  
* interfere  
* committed  
* fighting  
* problem  
* domestic measures  
* formally renounced  
* ratification  
* committing  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed hope that the United States would not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions. He emphasized that the US is committed to joining global efforts to address the problem, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso also highlighted that the US would adopt domestic measures to combat the issue. Meanwhile, Brazil sent a message to its congress urging ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US remains the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by Russia, Japan, and other nations. END OF SUMMARY.
