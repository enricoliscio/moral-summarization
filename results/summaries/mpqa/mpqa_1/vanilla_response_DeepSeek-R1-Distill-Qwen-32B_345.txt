Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read it carefully. The article is about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas negotiations and the US's involvement. President Cardoso is hopeful that the US won't interfere in international talks. He believes the US is committed to fighting the problem, even though they've rejected the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil is ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and aims to reduce emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The article also lists the top greenhouse gas emitters, with the US leading at 36%.

I should start the summary by mentioning Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere. Then, include Cardoso's comments about the US's commitment despite rejecting Kyoto. Next, note Brazil's ratification and their target. Finally, list the top emitters briefly. Keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.
