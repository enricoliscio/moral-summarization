SUMMARY:
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. He believes that despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, the US remains committed to tackling this global problem and will adopt its own domestic measures. Cardoso's statements come as Brazil moves to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, with a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This step underscores Brazil's dedication to combating the harmful impacts of greenhouse gases, the largest sources of which are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, and other industrialized nations. The international community's collective commitment to mitigating these emissions is crucial for the well-being of present and future generations. END OF SUMMARY.
