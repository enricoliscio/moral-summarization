SUMMARY:
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to joining other nations in fighting the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and will adopt domestic measures to reduce its emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing the country to reducing its greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This move is crucial, as the US, Russia, Japan, and other major emitters must work together to combat this pressing environmental issue. By taking responsibility and working together, nations can make a positive impact on the environment. END OF SUMMARY.
