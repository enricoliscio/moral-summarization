SUMMARY: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the US remains committed to joining the global fight against climate change and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In a message to congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Brazil's stance demonstrates a commitment to fighting climate change and encourages other nations, especially the major greenhouse gas emitters, to follow suit. Among the world's top emitters, the United States contributes the highest percentage of greenhouse gases, followed by Russia, Japan, Germany, and other industrialized nations. Brazil's stance is a step in the right direction and sets a positive example for international cooperation in combating climate change.
