SUMMARY:
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Cardoso believes the US is committed to joining other nations in fighting the problem of greenhouse gases, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil, on the other hand, is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This move is crucial, as the world's biggest sources of greenhouse gases are led by the US, responsible for 36% of emissions. By taking responsibility, Brazil is setting an example for other nations to follow in the fight against this pressing problem. END OF SUMMARY.
