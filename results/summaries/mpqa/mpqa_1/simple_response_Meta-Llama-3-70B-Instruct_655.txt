SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere with international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This move is significant, as the US is currently the largest contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions. Brazil's efforts demonstrate a sense of moral responsibility towards mitigating the effects of climate change, and Cardoso's optimism suggests that he believes the US will ultimately do the right thing and follow suit.

END OF SUMMARY.
