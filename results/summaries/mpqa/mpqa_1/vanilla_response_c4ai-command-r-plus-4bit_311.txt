SUMMARY: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil expressed optimism that the United States will not impede international efforts to combat climate change, despite formally withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. He made this statement as he urged the Brazilian congress to ratify the protocol, committing to a 5.2% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. Brazil's commitment to this protocol underscores its dedication to environmental sustainability and its willingness to work collaboratively to address climate change. Cardoso's message conveys Brazil's proactive stance and encourages other nations, including the major emitters listed, to take similar actions in mitigating the impacts of greenhouse gases. 

Cardoso's statement also highlights the significance of individual country contributions in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As the protocol outlines specific targets for emissions reduction, countries like Brazil are taking steps to meet these goals and encourage broader participation. This news underscores the ongoing international negotiations and highlights Brazil's leadership in urging countries to take responsibility for their emissions.
