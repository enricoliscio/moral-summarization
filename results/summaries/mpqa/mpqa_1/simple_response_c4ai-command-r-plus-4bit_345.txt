SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not impede international efforts to combat climate change, despite formally withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. In a show of commitment to the cause, Cardoso sent a message to Congress requesting the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and pledging Brazil's contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This moral choice by Brazil stands in stark contrast to the actions of the world's largest polluter, the United States, which has shirked its responsibility by withdrawing from the protocol. It is imperative that countries unite in tackling this global crisis, and Brazil's stance serves as a moral beacon, urging other nations to prioritize environmental preservation over short-sighted interests. Cardoso's faith in the US's willingness to address the issue domestically reflects a hopeful outlook on international cooperation. The aforementioned countries, responsible for a significant proportion of global emissions, must be held accountable and encouraged to take concrete actions towards a sustainable future.
