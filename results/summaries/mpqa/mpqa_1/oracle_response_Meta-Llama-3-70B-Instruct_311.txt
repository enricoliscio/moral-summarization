SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and instead will commit to fighting the problem alongside other nations. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the US will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso submitting a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is significant, as the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases include the US, Russia, Japan, and several European nations. By taking a stand, Brazil is fighting to mitigate the effects of climate change and setting an example for other nations to follow. END OF SUMMARY.
