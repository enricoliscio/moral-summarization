SUMMARY: As President Fernando Henrique Cardoso sends a message to Congress calling for Brazil's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he expresses hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on this crucial issue. Despite the US formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes they will still take domestic measures to combat the problem. This stance is significant as the US is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing to 36% of global emissions. Cardoso's message showcases his moral commitment to holding the biggest emitters accountable and ensuring their participation in finding a solution to this global crisis. Brazil is doing its part by aiming to reduce emissions by 5.2% by 2012, setting a positive example for other nations. This news highlights the ethical responsibility of nations to work together and find a solution, despite political differences, for the betterment of our planet and future generations.
