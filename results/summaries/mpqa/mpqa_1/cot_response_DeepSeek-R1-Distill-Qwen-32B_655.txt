Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article, then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and their hope that the US won't interfere in greenhouse gas negotiations. The President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, believes the US is committed despite renouncing the protocol. Brazil is taking steps to ratify the protocol and reduce emissions.

For STEP 1, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "interfere," "commitment," "fighting," "problem," "domestic measures," "formally renounced," "ratification," and "reduce." These terms imply actions, responsibilities, and moral obligations.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll mention Brazil's hope, the President's belief in US commitment, the US's stance despite renouncing Kyoto, Brazil's ratification, and the emission reduction target. I should also include the global emission percentages to highlight the significance.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. Let me structure it to first state Brazil's hope, then Cardoso's comments on the US, followed by Brazil's actions, and end with the global context to emphasize the importance.

I should also make sure to include the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, "interfere" shows concern, "commitment" and "fighting" show dedication, "formally renounced" indicates a decision, "ratification" is a formal approval, and "reduce" is an action taken.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly convey Brazil's position, the US's role, and the global implications, all while preserving the moral elements from the original text.

**STEP 1:**  
* interfere  
* commit  
* fight  
* problem  
* domestic measures  
* renounced  
* ratification  
* reduce  

**SUMMARY:**  
Brazil hopes the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to control greenhouse gas emissions. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed confidence that the US is committed to joining global efforts to address the problem, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. He emphasized that the US will adopt domestic measures to combat the issue. Cardoso sent a message to Congress urging Brazil to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US remains the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions, followed by Russia at 17.4%, Japan at 8.5%, and others. Brazil's stance reflects a broader call for international cooperation to address this critical issue.
