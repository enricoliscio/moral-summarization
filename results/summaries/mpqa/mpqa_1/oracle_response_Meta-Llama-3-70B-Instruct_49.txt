SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, instead committing to fighting the problem alongside other nations. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the US will adopt domestic measures to combat climate change. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is crucial, as the US is currently the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of emissions. By taking action, Brazil is joining the global effort to fight climate change.
