SUMMARY:

Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, instead committing to fighting the problem alongside other nations. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the US will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is crucial, as the world's biggest sources of greenhouse gases are led by the United States, accounting for 36% of emissions. By taking a stand, Brazil is fighting to mitigate the effects of climate change, and Cardoso hopes the US will follow suit.
