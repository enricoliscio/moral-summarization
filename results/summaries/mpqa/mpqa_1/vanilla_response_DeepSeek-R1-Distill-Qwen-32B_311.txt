Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Brazil's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and greenhouse gas emissions. President Cardoso is hopeful the US won't interfere in international negotiations. He mentions that the US has renounced the Kyoto Protocol but believes they're still committed to fighting the problem through domestic measures. 

I should note that Brazil is sending a message to Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Also, the article lists the top greenhouse gas emitters, with the US leading at 36%. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere. Then mention Cardoso's belief in the US's commitment despite renouncing Kyoto. Include Brazil's plan to ratify the protocol and their emission reduction target. Finally, list the top emitters briefly. 

I should structure it clearly, making each point flow logically. Keep it factual and within the word limit. Double-check to ensure all key points are covered without unnecessary details.
