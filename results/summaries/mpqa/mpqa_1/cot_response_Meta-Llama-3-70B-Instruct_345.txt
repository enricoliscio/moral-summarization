SUMMARY:
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, believing the US is committed to fighting the problem alongside other nations. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso trusts the US will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is crucial, as the world's largest emitters, including the US, Russia, and Japan, account for a significant portion of global emissions. By taking action, Brazil is doing its part to combat the pressing issue of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
