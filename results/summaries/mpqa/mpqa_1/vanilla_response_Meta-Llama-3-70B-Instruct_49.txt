SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the US will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the US formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the country is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures. He made these remarks as he sent a message to congress calling for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Brazil, committing the country to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US is currently the largest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions, followed by Russia, Japan, and other countries.
