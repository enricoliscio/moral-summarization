SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the US will not interfere with international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the US formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes the country is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures. Cardoso made his remarks as he sent a message to congress calling for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The US is currently the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of emissions, followed by Russia, Japan, and other countries.
