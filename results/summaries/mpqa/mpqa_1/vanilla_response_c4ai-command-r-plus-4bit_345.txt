SUMMARY: Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not hinder international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite formally withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. In a message to Congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and committed to reducing Brazil's greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Cardoso believes that the US will adopt domestic measures to combat the issue, despite its formal withdrawal from the agreement. He also noted that the largest sources of greenhouse gases are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, and other developed nations. The commitment by Brazil, a developing nation, highlights the global effort to address climate change and the importance of international cooperation in this regard.
