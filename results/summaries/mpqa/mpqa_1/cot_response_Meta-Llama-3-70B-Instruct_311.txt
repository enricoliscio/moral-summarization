SUMMARY:
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to fighting the problem of greenhouse gases and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is crucial, as the world's biggest sources of greenhouse gases include the US, Russia, Japan, and others. By taking responsibility, Brazil is doing its part in fighting this critical environmental issue. END OF SUMMARY.
