SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the US will not interfere with international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In a message to congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to a 5.2% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2012. The move is significant, as the US is currently the largest contributor to greenhouse gases, accounting for 36% of global emissions. The president's stance is morally commendable, as it prioritizes the well-being of the planet and future generations over national interests. By taking a proactive role in reducing emissions, Brazil sets a positive example for other nations to follow.
