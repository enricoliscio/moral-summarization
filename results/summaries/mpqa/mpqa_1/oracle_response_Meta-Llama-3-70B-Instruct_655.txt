SUMMARY: 
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations to combat the greenhouse effect. He believes the US is committed to fighting this global problem alongside other nations. Although the US has formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso thinks they will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil is taking a proactive stance, with Cardoso sending a message to congress calling for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This move commits Brazil to reducing its greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The world's top emitters of greenhouse gases are the US, Russia, Japan, Germany, and others, highlighting the need for collective action to fight this environmental issue.
