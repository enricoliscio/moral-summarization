SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the US remains committed to fighting this global issue and will adopt measures to reduce their emissions. In a message to Congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Brazil's stance demonstrates a commitment to fighting climate change and encourages other nations, especially the major greenhouse gas emitters, to adopt similar measures. The aforementioned countries, including the US, have a responsibility to future generations to combat this global problem. END OF SUMMARY.
