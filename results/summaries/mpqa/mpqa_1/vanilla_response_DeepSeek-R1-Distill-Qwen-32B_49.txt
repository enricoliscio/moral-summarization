Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Brazil's stance on greenhouse gas negotiations and the US's involvement. 

First, I see that President Cardoso of Brazil doesn't think the US will interfere in the international talks. He believes the US is committed to fighting the issue, even though they've renounced the Kyoto Protocol. That's an important point to include.

The article also mentions that Brazil is sending a message to Congress to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and commit to reducing emissions by 5.2% by 2012. That's a key detail for the summary.

Additionally, there's a list of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. I should note that the US is the largest emitter at 36%, followed by Russia, Japan, and others. This context is useful for understanding the significance of the US's stance.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll start by stating Brazil's hope that the US won't interfere, mention Cardoso's belief in the US's commitment despite the Kyoto withdrawal, and then note Brazil's actions regarding the protocol. Finally, I'll list the top emitters to provide context on why the US's role is crucial.

Let me structure this clearly: mention Brazil's hope, Cardoso's statements, Brazil's ratification message, and the emission percentages. I should avoid any markdown and keep it straightforward.

I think that covers all the main points without going over the word limit. I'll make sure it's clear and concise for the user.
