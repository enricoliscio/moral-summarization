SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the US remains committed to joining the global fight against climate change and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In a message to Congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Brazil's stance demonstrates its commitment to actively fighting climate change and encouraging other nations, especially the major emitters, to adopt similar measures. The mentioned major emitters of greenhouse gases, in decreasing order, are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, Italy, Poland, and France, with the US alone responsible for 36% of global emissions. Brazil's stance is significant as it showcases its dedication to tackling this global issue.
