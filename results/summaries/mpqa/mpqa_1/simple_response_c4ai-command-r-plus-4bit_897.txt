SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed optimism that the United States will not hinder international efforts to combat climate change, despite formally withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol. In a display of commitment to this global issue, Cardoso sent a message to congress advocating for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% by 2012. This moral choice demonstrates Brazil's responsible approach to environmental stewardship and sets a standard for other nations, particularly the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to follow. It is imperative that countries unite in tackling climate change, and Brazil's actions encourage a collaborative global effort. Cardoso's statement underscores the importance of countries taking ownership of their environmental impact and working together to create a sustainable future. It remains to be seen whether the United States will respond to this call for collective action and commit to reducing their significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
