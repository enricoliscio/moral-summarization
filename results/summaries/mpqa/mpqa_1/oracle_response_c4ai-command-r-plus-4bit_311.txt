SUMMARY: Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the US formally renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, Cardoso believes that the country remains committed to joining the global fight against climate change and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. In a message to congress, Cardoso called for Brazil's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, pledging to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. Brazil's stance demonstrates its commitment to fighting climate change and encourages other nations to adopt similar measures to mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gases, with the United States being the world's largest emitter.
