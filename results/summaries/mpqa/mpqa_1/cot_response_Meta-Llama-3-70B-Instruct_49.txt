SUMMARY:
Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expressed hope that the United States will not interfere in international negotiations on controlling greenhouse gas emissions, despite having formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol. Cardoso believes the US is committed to joining other nations in fighting the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and will adopt domestic measures to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, Brazil has sent a message to congress calling for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, committing the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012. The move is seen as a positive step in the global effort to combat the greenhouse effect, with the US, Russia, Japan, Germany, and other major emitters being urged to follow suit. By taking proactive steps, Brazil is setting an example for other nations to join in fighting this pressing environmental problem.
