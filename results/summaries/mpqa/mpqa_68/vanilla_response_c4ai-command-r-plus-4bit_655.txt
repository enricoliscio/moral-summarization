SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their differing approaches to addressing global warming. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing concerns about its potential impact on U.S. economic growth. Instead, he proposed a voluntary plan for companies to limit emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, welcomed Bush's proposal but called for further efforts from the U.S. and emphasized the compatibility of economic growth and environmental protection. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on addressing global warming, including through the development of new technologies. The environmentalists criticized Bush's plan as ineffective in reducing emissions. The two leaders also discussed other issues during the summit talks.
