SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had differing views on addressing global warming during their meeting. Bush stood by his *rejection* of the Kyoto Protocol, believing it would *hurt* U.S. economic growth. He proposed a controversial alternative with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which environmentalists deemed *ineffective*. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, urged the U.S. to make further *improvements*, suggesting that economic *development* and environmental protection can go *together*. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to *cooperate* on global warming issues and acknowledged the potential for technological *improvements* to *help* address the problem. They also agreed to include developing nations in their collaborative efforts. Bush's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and his alternative proposal sparked debate, with critics arguing that it allows U.S. emissions to *continue* rising.
