SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held a summit meeting, where they differed on the Kyoto Protocol and global warming prevention methods. Bush reiterated his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, instead pushing for his alternative plan announced last week, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, praised the US plan as "constructive" but urged the US to make more efforts. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming issues, including developing new technologies with other countries, including developing nations. Koizumi emphasized that both economic growth and environmental improvement are possible. The US plan has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective in solving global warming, warning that US greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise.

END OF SUMMARY.
