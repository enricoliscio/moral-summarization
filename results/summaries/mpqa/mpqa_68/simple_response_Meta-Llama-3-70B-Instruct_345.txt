SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush have differing opinions on how to address global warming. While Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Bush rejects it, citing concerns about US economic growth. Instead, Bush proposes voluntary limits on emissions, which environmentalists deem ineffective. Despite their differences, both leaders agree to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the importance of developing new technologies to combat global warming. Koizumi emphasizes the need for the US to make further efforts to reduce emissions, while Bush prioritizes economic growth. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the US's reluctance to take decisive action on global warming, despite its significant contribution to the problem, is a dereliction of its responsibility to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable future.
