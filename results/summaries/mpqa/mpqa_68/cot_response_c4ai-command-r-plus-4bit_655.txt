SUMMARY: 
President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi met to discuss their differing approaches to addressing global warming. Bush stood by his *rejection* of the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns about its potential to *hurt* US economic growth. He instead *proposed* an *alternative* plan with *voluntary* limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. This plan was *criticized* by environmentalists who argued it would be *ineffective* in addressing global warming and *warned* that emissions would continue to rise. Koizumi, who *supports* the Kyoto Protocol, *agreed* that while the US and Japan may differ in their approaches, they can still *cooperate* on the issue. He encouraged the US to make further *efforts* and emphasized that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. The two leaders ultimately *agreed* to work *together* with other countries, including developing nations, to tackle global warming, recognizing the potential for *cooperation* in developing new technologies that benefit both the economy and the environment. 

END OF SUMMARY.
