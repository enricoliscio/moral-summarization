Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've broken it down into two steps: first identifying the morally framed words, then writing the summary. 

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, influencing the reader's moral judgment. For example, "rejected" has a negative connotation, implying disapproval, while "constructive" is positive.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence to spot these words. Bush "rejected" the Kyoto Protocol, so "rejected" is one. The protocol is "aimed at curbing," so "curbing" is positive. Bush's alternative is "criticized" as "ineffective," so both "criticized" and "ineffective" are negative. "Voluntary" vs. "mandatory" are opposites, with "voluntary" maybe seen as less strict. "Hurt" economic growth is negative. "Cooperate" is positive, as is "improved." "Further efforts" implies a need for more action. "Continue" and "same direction" are neutral but in context, they support the moral stance. "Effective" is positive, "rising" is negative. "Cooperation" and "development" are positive, as is "help." "Economic development" ties back to the moral balance between economy and environment.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating the main point: Japan and the US differ on Kyoto but agree to cooperate. Then, mention Bush's rejection and his alternative, noting it's criticized. Include Koizumi's support for Kyoto and his hope for US efforts. Highlight the cooperation on technology development, tying it to both environment and economy. Make sure to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral nuances.

I should ensure the summary flows well, using the identified words to convey the moral framing. For example, using "rejected" and "criticized" to show disapproval of Bush's stance, while "constructive" and "improved" show support for Kyoto. Also, note the environmentalists' criticism to add depth. Finally, emphasize the positive outcome of cooperation despite differences.

**SUMMARY:**  
Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Prime Minister Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and President Bush rejecting it. Bush advocates for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, a plan criticized as ineffective by environmentalists. Koizumi called the U.S. proposal "constructive" but urged further efforts, emphasizing the need for both economic growth and environmental improvement. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was based on concerns it would harm the U.S. economy. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming initiatives, including developing new technologies that could benefit both the environment and economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
