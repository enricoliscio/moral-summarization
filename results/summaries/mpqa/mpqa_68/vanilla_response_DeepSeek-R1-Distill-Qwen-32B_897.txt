Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. Let me read through the article first.

The article says that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had a difference of opinion regarding the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce global warming, and instead proposed an alternative plan last week. Koizumi called this new plan "very constructive" but asked for more efforts from the U.S.

Bush's alternative plan involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, unlike the mandatory targets in Kyoto. Environmentalists criticize this plan as ineffective because it might lead to continued rises in U.S. emissions.

Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming issues, including working with other countries, especially developing nations. They also plan to collaborate on developing new technologies that benefit both the environment and the economy.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should mention the key points: their differing views on Kyoto, Bush's alternative plan, Koizumi's support for Kyoto but acknowledgment of the U.S. proposal, the criticism of the plan, and their agreement to cooperate on technology and with other countries.

Let me structure this clearly, ensuring each main point is covered concisely. I should avoid unnecessary details and focus on the main actions and agreements between the two leaders.

SUMMARY:  
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush held differing views on global warming during their summit. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to curb global warming, and instead promoted an alternative plan he unveiled last week, focusing on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth. Koizumi described the U.S. proposal as "constructive" but urged further efforts, emphasizing the importance of addressing global warming while supporting economic growth. Environmentalists criticize Bush's plan as ineffective, predicting continued rises in U.S. emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to collaborate on global warming initiatives, including developing new technologies and working with other nations, particularly developing ones, to address the issue.  
END OF SUMMARY.
