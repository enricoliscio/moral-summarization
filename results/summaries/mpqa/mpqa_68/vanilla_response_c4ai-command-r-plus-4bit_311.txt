SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush discussed global warming and the Kyoto Protocol during a meeting. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, instead proposing voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called Bush's plan "constructive" but asked for further efforts from the U.S. While Bush argued that the Kyoto pact would hurt U.S. economic growth, Koizumi believed that economic growth and environmental protection could go hand in hand. Bush's alternative proposal was criticized by environmentalists as ineffective in addressing global warming. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming issues, including the development of new technologies to help the environment and economic development.

END OF SUMMARY.
