SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush disagreed on how to address global warming during their summit talks. Bush reiterated his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement aimed at curbing global warming, and instead pushed for his alternative proposal announced last week. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called the new US plan "constructive" but urged the US to make further efforts. The US proposal, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue of global warming, including working together on developing new technologies that can help both the environment and economic development.

END OF SUMMARY.
