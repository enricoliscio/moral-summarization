SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their differing approaches to the global warming crisis. Bush infamously rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a global effort to curb greenhouse emissions, claiming it would hurt US economic interests. Instead, he proposed a plan with voluntary limits on emissions, a plan that environmentalists warn is ineffective and will lead to further emissions increases. Koizumi, though supportive of the Kyoto Protocol, called Bush's alternative proposal "constructive," but urged the US to do more. He emphasized that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand, a moral stance that prioritizes the planet and future generations. The two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, including with developing nations, and acknowledged the potential benefits of new technologies in this field. However, the moral implications of Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and his alternative plan's potential ineffectiveness remain a concern for the global community. END OF SUMMARY.
