SUMMARY: In a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush, the two leaders disagreed over the best approach to address global warming, specifically regarding the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush maintained his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns about its potential negative impact on US economic growth, and instead proposed a plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. This alternative proposal was criticized by environmentalists as ineffective and insufficient to address the urgent issue of global warming. Prime Minister Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, acknowledged the US plan as constructive but urged for further efforts and commitment from the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The two leaders found common ground in their agreement to cooperate with other countries, including developing nations, to tackle global warming and promote the development of new technologies that can address environmental and economic concerns simultaneously.
