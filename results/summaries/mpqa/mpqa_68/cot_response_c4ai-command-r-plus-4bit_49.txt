SUMMARY: 
In a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush, the two leaders differed in their approaches to addressing global warming. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement aimed at curbing the effects of global warming, and proposed an alternative plan focusing on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol is based on the belief that it would hurt U.S. economic growth. Koizumi, who supports the Kyoto Protocol, asked for further efforts and emphasized that economic improvement and environmental protection can go hand in hand. Bush's alternative proposal has been criticized by environmentalists as being ineffective and allowing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to continue rising. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue of global warming, including the development of new technologies that benefit the environment and economic development. Koizumi encouraged additional efforts and a unified direction from the U.S. to address this global challenge. END OF SUMMARY.
