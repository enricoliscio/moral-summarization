SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush differed on the Kyoto Protocol, with Bush rejecting it and Koizumi supporting it. Despite their differences, they agreed to cooperate on preventing global warming. Bush pushed for his alternative plan, which involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, while Koizumi called it a "very constructive proposal" but urged for more efforts from the US. Koizumi emphasized that both the economy and the environment can be improved together, and hoped for further efforts from the US. Environmentalists have criticized Bush's plan as ineffective and warned that it would lead to a continued rise in US greenhouse gas emissions. The two leaders agreed to work together with other countries, including developing nations, to address global warming and develop new technologies that benefit both the environment and economic development.
