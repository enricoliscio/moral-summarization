SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush differed on the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial issue in the fight against global warming. Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns that it would hurt the US economy, while Koizumi supported it, emphasizing that both the economy and environment can be improved together. Bush proposed an alternative plan, which environmentalists deem ineffective in solving global warming, as it relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. Koizumi urged the US to make further efforts to combat global warming, hoping that both countries can move in the same direction. Despite their differences, the leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies that can help both the environment and economic development. This cooperation is crucial, as it can provide a solution that benefits both the economy and the environment.
