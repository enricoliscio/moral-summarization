SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their differing approaches to addressing global warming and the Kyoto Protocol. Bush maintained his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns about economic growth, while Koizumi, a supporter of the protocol, acknowledged the potential for harmony between economic development and environmental protection. Bush proposed voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies, a plan criticized by environmentalists as ineffective. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the potential benefits of new technologies in mitigating environmental harm while promoting economic growth. Koizumi encouraged further environmental efforts from the U.S., emphasizing that economic growth and environmental improvement are not mutually exclusive. The moral framework of the article highlights the tension between economic priorities and environmental responsibilities, with Koizumi advocating for a balanced approach that addresses global warming without sacrificing economic progress.
