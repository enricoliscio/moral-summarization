Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had a meeting where they discussed global warming. They had differing opinions on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected it, saying it would harm the U.S. economy, and instead proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gases based on economic growth. Koizumi called this proposal "constructive" but asked for more efforts from the U.S. He supports the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce emissions.

Environmentalists are criticizing Bush's alternative as ineffective because it won't reduce emissions enough and might even let them rise. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies to tackle global warming, which could also boost economic development. They also plan to work with other countries, including developing nations, on this issue.

So, the key points are:
1. Japan and the U.S. have different stances on the Kyoto Protocol.
2. Bush rejects Kyoto, proposes voluntary emissions limits.
3. Koizumi supports Kyoto but acknowledges the U.S.'s alternative as constructive, asking for more efforts.
4. Environmentalists criticize the U.S. plan as ineffective.
5. Both countries agree to cooperate on technology development for global warming solutions, which can also aid economic growth.
6. They plan to collaborate with other nations, including developing ones.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating their differing views on Kyoto, then mention Bush's alternative and Koizumi's response. I'll note the criticism of the alternative and their agreement to cooperate on technology and with other countries.

Let me check the word count as I write to ensure it's concise. I should avoid including too many details and focus on the main points. Also, make sure the summary flows logically from their disagreement to their cooperation plan.

SUMMARY: Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Prime Minister Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and President Bush rejecting it in favor of an alternative plan. Bush's proposal calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, while Koizumi acknowledges it as constructive but urges more effort from the U.S. Environmentalists criticize the alternative as ineffective, predicting rising emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies to combat global warming, which could also boost economic growth, and to collaborate with other nations, including developing countries. END OF SUMMARY.
