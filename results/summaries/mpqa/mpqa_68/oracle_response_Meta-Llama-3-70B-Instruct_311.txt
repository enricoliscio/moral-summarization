SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush disagreed on how to address global warming, with Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and instead proposing voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called the new US plan "a very constructive proposal" but urged the US to make further efforts to reduce emissions. The Japanese leader emphasized that both the economy and the environment can be improved together, and that the US should strive to do more. Environmentalists have criticized the US proposal as ineffective in solving global warming, warning that emissions will continue to rise under the plan. Despite their differences, Koizumi and Bush agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the potential for new technologies to help both the environment and economic development.
