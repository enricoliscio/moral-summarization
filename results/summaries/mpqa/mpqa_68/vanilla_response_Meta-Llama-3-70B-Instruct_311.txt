SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held a summit meeting, where they disagreed on the Kyoto Protocol and global warming prevention methods. Bush reiterated his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, instead pushing for his alternative plan announced last week, which involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called the new US plan "constructive" but urged the US to make further efforts. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming issues, including developing new technologies that can benefit both the environment and economic growth. The US plan has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective in solving global warming, with warnings that US greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise.

END OF SUMMARY.
