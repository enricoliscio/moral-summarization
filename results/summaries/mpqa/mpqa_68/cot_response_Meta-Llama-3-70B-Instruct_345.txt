SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held a summit to discuss global warming issues, with differing views on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush reiterated his rejection of the protocol, citing concerns over US economic growth, and instead proposed voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called the new US plan "a very constructive proposal" but urged for more efforts from the US. He emphasized that both the economy and environment can be improved together, and hoped for further efforts from the US. Environmentalists have criticized the US proposal as ineffective and warned that it would lead to a continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, including developing new technologies that can benefit both the environment and economy.
