SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush had differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at curbing global warming. Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns about economic growth, while Koizumi supported it. Bush proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, but this was criticized by environmentalists as ineffective. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on addressing global warming, including through the development of new technologies. Koizumi urged the US to make further efforts, suggesting that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. The leaders also agreed to involve developing nations in global warming discussions.
END OF SUMMARY.
