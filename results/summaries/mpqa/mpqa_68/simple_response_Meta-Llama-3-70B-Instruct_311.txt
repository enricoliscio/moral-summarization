SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush have differing views on how to address global warming. While Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Bush rejects it, citing concerns about its impact on the US economy. Instead, Bush proposes voluntary limits on emissions, which environmentalists argue is ineffective. Despite their differences, both leaders agree to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the importance of addressing global warming. Koizumi emphasizes the need for balance between economic growth and environmental protection, urging the US to make further efforts to reduce emissions. The two leaders also agree on the importance of developing new technologies to combat global warming, which can benefit both the environment and the economy.
