SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush held differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at curbing global warming. Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns about its impact on U.S. economic growth, while Koizumi supported it, believing that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. Bush proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which environmentalists criticized as ineffective and insufficient to address the pressing issue of global warming. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on tackling global warming, recognizing the potential benefits of new technologies in this field for both the environment and economic development. Koizumi urged the U.S. to do more, asking for further efforts to align with Japan's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.
