Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol, while the U.S. President Bush rejects it. Bush is pushing his alternative plan, which is voluntary and based on economic growth. Environmentalists criticize this plan as ineffective. Both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies that benefit both the environment and economy.

I should highlight the differing stances on the Kyoto Protocol and the alternative plan. It's important to mention the moral aspects, like the criticism of Bush's plan being ineffective and the emphasis on mutual benefits from cooperation.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the essence. Make sure to include that Koizumi called the U.S. plan constructive but urged more effort, and that the alternative plan is seen as harmful by environmentalists.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the differing views, then the alternative plan, criticism, and the agreement to cooperate on technology.

SUMMARY:  
Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush rejecting it. Bush advocates for an alternative plan, which includes voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, while Koizumi describes this proposal as "constructive" but urges further U.S. efforts. Koizumi emphasizes the importance of aligning global efforts to combat climate change, stating that both economic growth and environmental protection can be achieved together. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, which he claims would harm U.S. economic growth, has drawn criticism from environmentalists, who argue his plan is ineffective and could lead to rising emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to collaborate on developing new technologies to address global warming, which they believe could benefit both environmental and economic goals. END OF SUMMARY.
