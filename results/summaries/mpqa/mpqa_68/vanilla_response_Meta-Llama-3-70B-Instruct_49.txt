SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held a summit meeting, where they differed on the Kyoto Protocol and approaches to prevent global warming. Bush reiterated his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, instead promoting his alternative plan, which involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called the US plan "constructive" but urged the US to make further efforts. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, including working with developing nations and developing new technologies that can benefit both the environment and economy. Environmentalists have criticized the US plan as ineffective in solving global warming, warning that it would allow US greenhouse gas emissions to continue rising.

END OF SUMMARY.
