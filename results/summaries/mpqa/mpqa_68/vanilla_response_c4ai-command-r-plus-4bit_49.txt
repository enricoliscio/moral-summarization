SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement aimed at curbing the effects of climate change. Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns about its impact on U.S. economic growth, and proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called Bush's plan constructive but requested further efforts from the U.S. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on addressing global warming, including through the development of new technologies that can benefit both the environment and economic growth. Environmentalists criticized Bush's plan as ineffective, arguing that it would allow U.S. emissions to continue rising. The two leaders also agreed to involve developing nations in global warming discussions.
