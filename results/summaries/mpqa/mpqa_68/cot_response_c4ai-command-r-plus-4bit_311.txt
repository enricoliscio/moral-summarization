SUMMARY: 
Amid differing views on global warming, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their approaches to this pressing issue. Bush stood by his *rejection* of the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns about potential harm to U.S. economic growth. He proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which was criticized by environmentalists as *ineffective* and insufficient for addressing global warming. Despite their differences, Koizumi and Bush *agreed* to *cooperate* and work *together* on tackling this global challenge. 

Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, urged further *improvements* in U.S. efforts, suggesting that economic growth and environmental protection can go *hand in hand*. The two leaders acknowledged the potential for *cooperation* in developing new technologies that would benefit both the economy and the environment. This meeting reflected a joint commitment to addressing global warming, despite differing strategies, with a shared goal of *improving* environmental conditions.
