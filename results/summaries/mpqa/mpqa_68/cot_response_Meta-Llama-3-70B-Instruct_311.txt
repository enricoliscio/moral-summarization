SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush had differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial step in preventing global warming. While Koizumi supports the protocol, Bush rejected it, citing concerns that it would hurt US economic growth. Instead, Bush proposed an alternative plan that relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective and warned that it would lead to a continued rise in US emissions. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing that both the economy and the environment can be improved together. Koizumi expressed hope that the US would make further efforts to address global warming, and both leaders acknowledged the importance of developing new technologies to combat the issue.
