SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush disagreed on how to address global warming, with Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and Koizumi supporting it. Bush's alternative proposal, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, is criticized by environmentalists as ineffective in solving global warming. Koizumi, however, called the proposal "constructive" but urged the US to make further efforts to reduce emissions. The two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand-in-hand. They also agreed to work together on developing new technologies that can help both the environment and economic development. Koizumi emphasized the importance of continued efforts to address global warming, stating that "both the economy and the environment can be improved together."
