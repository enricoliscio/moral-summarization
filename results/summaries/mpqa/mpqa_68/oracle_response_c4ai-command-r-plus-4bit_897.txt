SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at curbing global warming. President Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns about its potential harm to US economic growth, and instead proposed a plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. This plan has been criticized by environmentalists as being ineffective in addressing global warming and emissions reduction. Despite their differences, Prime Minister Koizumi and President Bush agreed to cooperate on the issue of global warming and recognized the potential for technological advancements to both help the environment and promote economic development.

Koizumi urged the US to make further efforts towards environmental protection, suggesting that economic growth and environmental improvement can go hand in hand. Their agreement to work together, including with developing nations, highlights a shared commitment to addressing global warming, even amidst differing approaches and perspectives on the Kyoto Protocol.

END OF SUMMARY.
