SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush held differing views on how to address global warming, with Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and proposing an alternative plan. Despite their differences, they agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the importance of both the economy and the environment.

Koizumi supported the Kyoto Protocol and encouraged further environmental efforts from the U.S., acknowledging that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. Bush's alternative proposal, which focuses on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies, has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective and allowing U.S. emissions to continue rising.

Both leaders agreed to work together with other countries, including developing nations, to tackle global warming, believing that technological advancements can play a crucial role in both environmental protection and economic development. The summit highlighted the need for a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability, with Koizumi urging the U.S. to continue striving for improvement in both areas.
