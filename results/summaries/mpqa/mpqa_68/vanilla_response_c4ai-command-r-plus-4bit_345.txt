SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns about its impact on U.S. economic growth, and proposed an alternative plan with voluntary emission limits for companies. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, called Bush's plan constructive but requested further efforts from the U.S. While acknowledging the U.S.'s right to decide on its participation in the protocol, Koizumi emphasized that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. The leaders agreed to cooperate on addressing global warming, including through the development of new technologies, and recognized the importance of involving developing nations in these efforts. Environmentalists, however, criticized Bush's plan as ineffective in combating rising greenhouse gas emissions.
