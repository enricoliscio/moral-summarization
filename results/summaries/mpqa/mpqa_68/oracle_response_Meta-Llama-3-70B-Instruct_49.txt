SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial issue in the fight against global warming. While Koizumi supports the protocol, Bush rejected it, citing concerns that it would hurt the US economy. Instead, Bush proposed an alternative plan, which environmentalists deem ineffective in solving global warming, as it relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions rather than mandatory reduction targets. Koizumi, however, called the new plan "a very constructive proposal" and urged the US to make further efforts to address the issue. Both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies that can help the environment and promote economic development. The Japanese leader emphasized that both the economy and environment can be improved together, and that the US should strive to move in the same direction. END OF SUMMARY.
