Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points. It's about the differences between Japan and the U.S. regarding the Kyoto Protocol and their approaches to global warming.

The article mentions that both leaders, Koizumi and Bush, have differing views. Bush rejects the Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at curbing global warming, and instead pushes for an alternative plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol and calls the U.S. plan "constructive," but he's asking for more efforts from the U.S. 

I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the article again. Words like "rejected," "hurt," "voluntary," "mandatory," "criticized," "ineffective," "continue," "further efforts," "cooperate," "voluntary," "mandatory," "criticized," "ineffective," "continue," "further efforts," "cooperate," "voluntary," "mandatory," "criticized," "ineffective," "continue," "further efforts," "cooperate." Hmm, maybe some of these are repeated. I should list each unique word once.

Now, for the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating that Japan and the U.S. have differing views on global warming. Then, mention Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and his alternative plan with voluntary limits. Highlight that environmentalists criticize this as ineffective. Then, note Koizumi's support for Kyoto and his hope for more U.S. efforts. Finally, mention their agreement to cooperate on new technologies for mutual benefit.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose. Also, ensure that the moral framing is preserved by using words like "rejected," "voluntary," "mandatory," "criticized," "ineffective," "continue," "further efforts," "cooperate."

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the main topic, then each leader's stance, the criticism, and the agreement to cooperate. Keep each sentence concise and include the necessary moral terms.

**Summary:**

Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming. U.S. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, opting instead for an alternative plan with voluntary emission limits, which environmentalists criticize as ineffective. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol and hopes for further U.S. efforts, emphasizing that both economy and environment can be enhanced together. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies to tackle global warming, aiming for mutual benefits in environmental and economic growth.
