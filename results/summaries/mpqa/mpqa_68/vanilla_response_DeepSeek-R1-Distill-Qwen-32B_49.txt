Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. The user provided the article and an example summary, so I should follow that structure. 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi and U.S. President Bush. They have different views on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush doesn't support it, and Koizumi does but still sees the U.S. proposal as constructive. 

I should note the main points: Bush rejects Kyoto, proposes an alternative with voluntary limits, environmentalists criticize it as ineffective. Koizumi supports Kyoto but acknowledges the U.S. proposal. They agree to cooperate on technology and with other countries. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without going into too much detail. I'll start by stating their differing views on Kyoto, mention Bush's alternative, Koizumi's support for Kyoto but appreciation for the U.S. proposal, and their agreement to cooperate on technology and with other nations. 

I should also include that Bush's plan is criticized by environmentalists. Make sure to mention that the cooperation includes developing nations and that the technologies will help both the environment and economy. 

I think that's all the key points. Now, I'll structure this into a coherent summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush held differing views on global warming during their meeting, with Bush rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and proposing an alternative plan. Bush's plan calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, while Koizumi expressed support for the Kyoto Protocol but acknowledged the U.S. proposal as "constructive." Koizumi urged further efforts from the U.S., emphasizing that both economic growth and environmental protection are achievable. Bush, who rejected the Kyoto Protocol in March, criticized it for harming U.S. economic growth. Environmentalists have condemned the U.S. proposal as ineffective, predicting rising emissions. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming initiatives, including developing new technologies and collaborating with other nations, particularly developing ones. They emphasized that such technologies could benefit both environmental and economic development. END OF SUMMARY.
