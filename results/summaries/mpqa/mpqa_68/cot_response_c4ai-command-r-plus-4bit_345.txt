SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush held a summit to discuss their differing approaches to combating global warming. Bush stood by his *rejection* of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international agreement designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, citing concerns about its potential impact on U.S. economic growth. Instead, he proposed a voluntary plan for companies to limit emissions, which was met with *criticism* from environmentalists who *warned* it would be ineffective in addressing global warming. Despite their differences, Bush and Koizumi *agreed* to *cooperate* on the issue, recognizing the potential benefits of technological advancements in both environmental protection and economic development. Koizumi, who *supports* the Kyoto Protocol, encouraged further *efforts* from the U.S. to reduce emissions, suggesting that economic growth and environmental improvement can go hand in hand. The two leaders pledged to work together with other countries, including developing nations, to tackle the global challenge of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
