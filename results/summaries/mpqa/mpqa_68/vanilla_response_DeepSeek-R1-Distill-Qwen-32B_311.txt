Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by saying that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had a difference of opinion on the Kyoto Protocol and how to prevent global warming, but they agreed to cooperate on the issue. 

Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol again, which was aimed at curbing global warming. Instead, he pushed for his alternative plan that he announced last week. Koizumi called this new plan a "very constructive proposal" but asked the U.S. to do more. He supports the Kyoto Protocol and hopes they can work together in the same direction. He believes both the economy and environment can be improved together and wants the U.S. to make more efforts.

Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in March, saying it would hurt the U.S. economy. His alternative plan calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, unlike the mandatory targets in Kyoto. Environmentalists criticize this as ineffective and warn that emissions will keep rising.

In their summit talks, they agreed to cooperate with other countries, including developing nations, on global warming. They plan to work together on developing new technologies that benefit both the environment and the economy.

So, the key points are:
- Japan and U.S. differ on Kyoto Protocol.
- Bush rejects Kyoto, proposes alternative with voluntary limits.
- Koizumi supports Kyoto but calls the U.S. plan constructive, wants more efforts.
- Environmentalists criticize the U.S. plan as ineffective.
- Both agree to cooperate on new technologies and with other countries.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should mention the leaders, their differing views, Bush's alternative plan, Koizumi's support for Kyoto but appreciation for the proposal, the criticism, and their agreement to cooperate on technology and with other nations.

Let me structure it step by step.

Start with the leaders and their differing views on Kyoto. Then Bush's rejection and alternative plan. Koizumi's stance on Kyoto and his view on the U.S. plan. Environmentalists' criticism. Their agreement to cooperate on technology and with other countries.

Make sure it's concise and under 200 words.
