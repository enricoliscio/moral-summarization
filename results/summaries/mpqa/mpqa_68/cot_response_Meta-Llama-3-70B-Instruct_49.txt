SUMMARY:
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held differing views on the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty aimed at curbing global warming. While Koizumi expressed "hope" for the US to continue its "efforts" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Bush rejected the protocol, citing concerns over US economic growth. Instead, Bush proposed an alternative plan, which environmentalists have "criticized" as "ineffective" and warned would lead to a continued rise in emissions. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to "cooperate" on the issue, with a focus on developing new technologies that can benefit both the environment and economic development. Koizumi praised Bush's alternative proposal as "constructive," but urged the US to make further "efforts" to address global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
