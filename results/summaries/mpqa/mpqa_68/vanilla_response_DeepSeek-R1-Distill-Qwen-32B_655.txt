Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush had differing opinions on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected it, pushing for an alternative plan he announced. Koizumi called the new plan constructive but asked for more efforts from the U.S.

Bush's reasons for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol were that it would hurt U.S. economic growth. His alternative plan involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, unlike the mandatory targets in Kyoto. Environmentalists are critical, saying this won't solve global warming and that emissions might still rise.

Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate, including with developing nations, on global warming. They plan to work together on developing new technologies that benefit both the environment and the economy.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: their differing views on Kyoto, Bush's alternative plan, Koizumi's support for Kyoto but appreciation for the new plan, the criticism of the alternative, and their agreement to cooperate on technology.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with their differing views, then Bush's stance and plan, Koizumi's response, the criticism, and their agreement to collaborate.

Let me make sure I don't include any extra details and keep it concise. I'll need to mention the key elements without going into too much depth. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" token at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end as per the instructions.

I think I have a good grasp of the main points now. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush discussed global warming during their summit, highlighting their differing views on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected the 1997 agreement, which aims to curb global warming, and instead promoted an alternative plan announced last week. This plan calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, unlike the mandatory targets in the Kyoto Protocol. Koizumi acknowledged the new U.S. proposal as "constructive" but urged further efforts, emphasizing the importance of both economic and environmental progress. Environmentalists criticize the U.S. plan as ineffective, predicting continued rises in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming initiatives, including working with developing nations and advancing new technologies that could benefit both the environment and economic growth.  
END OF SUMMARY.
