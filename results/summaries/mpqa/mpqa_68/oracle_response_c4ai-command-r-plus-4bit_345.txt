SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their differing approaches to the issue of global warming. President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a mandatory agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, citing concerns for potential hurt in U.S. economic growth. He proposed an alternative plan with voluntary limits on emissions, tied to economic growth. This plan has been criticized by environmentalists as ineffective, warning that greenhouse emissions will continue to rise. 

Prime Minister Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, recognized the potential for both economic improvement and environmental protection, asking for further efforts and cooperation from the U.S. to move in the same direction. Both leaders agreed to work together and with developing nations to address global warming, recognizing the potential environmental and economic benefits of new technologies in this field. 

END OF SUMMARY.
