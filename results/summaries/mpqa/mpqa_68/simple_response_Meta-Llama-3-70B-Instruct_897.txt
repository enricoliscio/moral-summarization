SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush disagreed on the Kyoto Protocol, a crucial step in combating global warming. While Koizumi supports the protocol, Bush rejected it, citing concerns over US economic growth. Instead, Bush proposed a voluntary plan, which environmentalists deem ineffective. Koizumi urged the US to make further efforts, emphasizing that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand-in-hand. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the importance of developing new technologies to address global warming. This cooperation can benefit both the environment and economic development.

The moral framing of this article highlights the responsibility of nations to take collective action against global warming. It emphasizes the need for cooperation and compromise, rather than prioritizing economic interests over environmental concerns. The article suggests that it is morally imperative for countries to work together to address this critical issue, rather than pursuing individual interests.
