SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush met to discuss their differing approaches to combating global warming. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international agreement designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, citing concerns about its potential negative impact on U.S. economic growth. Instead, he proposed a voluntary plan for companies to limit emissions, prioritizing economic growth over mandatory reduction targets. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, acknowledged Bush's alternative proposal as constructive but urged for additional efforts and commitment from the U.S. to address this critical global issue. Koizumi emphasized the possibility of improving both the economy and the environment simultaneously and encouraged further environmental initiatives from the U.S. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to collaborate with other countries, including developing nations, to tackle global warming, recognizing the potential benefits of technological advancements in this area for both the environment and economic development.
