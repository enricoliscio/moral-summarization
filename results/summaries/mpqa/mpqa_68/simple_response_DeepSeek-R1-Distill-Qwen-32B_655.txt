Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about a meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister and the U.S. President where they discussed global warming. They have differing views on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejects it, preferring a voluntary plan, while Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol but acknowledges the U.S.'s stance.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. Bush's rejection is framed as prioritizing economic growth over environmental action, which is a criticism. Environmentalists are against his alternative plan, seeing it as ineffective. Koizumi, on the other hand, is portrayed as supportive of the Kyoto Protocol and hopeful for U.S. cooperation, emphasizing the balance between economy and environment.

I should structure the summary to highlight these moral perspectives. Start by stating their differences, then Bush's position and criticism, Koizumi's support and hopes, and their agreement on cooperation and technology development.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me outline the key points: their differing views, Bush's rejection and alternative plan, criticism from environmentalists, Koizumi's support and request for more U.S. effort, their agreement to cooperate, and the focus on technology.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and includes all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to maintain the moral framing by highlighting the contrast between Bush's economic focus and Koizumi's environmental stance, as well as the environmentalists' criticism.

Finally, I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary to ensure it's within the limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush rejecting it. Bush advocates for a voluntary plan, emphasizing economic growth over mandatory emissions reductions, while Koizumi calls this a "constructive proposal" but urges more U.S. effort. Environmentalists criticize Bush's plan as ineffective, predicting rising U.S. emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming initiatives, including working with developing nations and advancing new technologies that benefit both the economy and the environment.
