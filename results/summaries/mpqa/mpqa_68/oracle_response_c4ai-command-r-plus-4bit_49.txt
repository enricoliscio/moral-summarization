SUMMARY: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush may have disagreed on the best approach to tackling global warming, but they shared a common goal of wanting to address this critical issue. President Bush stood firm in his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns for the potential harm it could inflict on the US economy. Instead, he proposed a voluntary plan for companies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with economic growth. This alternative approach was criticized by environmentalists as being ineffective in combating global warming and potentially leading to increased emissions. 

Despite their differing views, Prime Minister Koizumi supported the Kyoto Protocol but also recognized the importance of economic growth. He encouraged further environmental efforts from the US, suggesting that economic improvement and environmental protection can go hand in hand. The leaders agreed to collaborate with other countries, including developing nations, to address global warming, believing that technological advancements in this field could benefit both the economy and the environment.
