SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush disagreed on how to address global warming, with Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and Bush pushing for his alternative plan. Bush rejected the Kyoto pact, citing concerns that it would hurt the US economy, and instead proposed voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions that align with economic growth. Environmentalists criticize this plan as ineffective in solving global warming, warning that US emissions will continue to rise. Koizumi, on the other hand, emphasized that both the economy and environment can be improved together, and urged the US to make further efforts. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, recognizing the potential for new technologies to help both the environment and economic development. By working together with other countries, including developing nations, they hope to make progress on this critical issue.
