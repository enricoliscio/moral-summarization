Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they're a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the differing viewpoints.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about Japan and the U.S. differing on the Kyoto Protocol. Bush rejected it, saying it would harm the economy, and proposed an alternative with voluntary limits. Koizumi supports Kyoto and called the U.S. plan constructive but asked for more effort. Environmentalists criticize the U.S. plan as ineffective.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The U.S. is prioritizing economic growth over environmental action, which could be seen as neglecting global responsibility. Japan, on the other hand, is emphasizing the importance of environmental action alongside economic benefits. The cooperation on technology development shows a potential positive outcome, but the moral framing is about the responsibility to address global warming.

I should structure the summary to show the conflict, the U.S. stance, Japan's support for Kyoto, the criticism, and the agreed cooperation. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, using clear and neutral language but ensuring the moral elements are present.

Let me draft it: Start with the leaders' differing views, mention Bush rejecting Kyoto, his alternative plan, Koizumi's support and request, environmental criticism, and their agreement to cooperate on technology. Make sure to note that the U.S. plan is criticized for being ineffective and that Japan hopes for more effort.

I think that covers all the key points and the moral framing. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and U.S. President George W. Bush rejecting it. Bush advocates for an alternative plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, while Koizumi describes this as "constructive" but urges further U.S. efforts. Environmentalists criticize the U.S. proposal as ineffective, warning that emissions could rise under the plan. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on global warming initiatives, including working with developing nations and advancing new technologies that could benefit both the environment and economies. Koizumi emphasized the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection, while Bush's stance reflects a priority on economic interests over mandatory emission reductions. END OF SUMMARY.
