SUMMARY:

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush held a summit meeting, where they differed on the Kyoto Protocol and approaches to prevent global warming. Bush reiterated his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, instead promoting his alternative plan announced last week, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Koizumi, a supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, praised the US plan as "constructive" but urged the US to make further efforts. Despite their differences, the two leaders agreed to cooperate on the issue, including working with developing nations and developing new technologies to address global warming. They emphasized that such cooperation can benefit both the environment and economic development.

END OF SUMMARY.
