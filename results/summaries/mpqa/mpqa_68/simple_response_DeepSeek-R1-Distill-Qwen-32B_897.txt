Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Japan and the U.S. differing on global warming issues, specifically regarding the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi supports the Kyoto Protocol, while the U.S. President Bush opposes it, pushing for an alternative plan. They agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies.

I should highlight the moral aspects: the U.S. rejecting the Kyoto Protocol as harmful to their economy versus Japan's support for the protocol and their hope for more U.S. efforts. Environmentalists criticize the U.S. plan as ineffective, which adds to the moral debate about effectiveness in combating global warming.

I'll need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures both sides' positions and the cooperation agreement. Also, I'll structure it to show the differing viewpoints and the underlying moral considerations each country has.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it includes both the U.S. and Japan's stances, the criticism from environmentalists, and the agreement on cooperation and technology development. I'll make sure to end with the END OF SUMMARY token as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
Japan and the U.S. have differing views on addressing global warming, with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi supporting the Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush rejecting it. Bush proposed an alternative plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions tied to economic growth, rather than the mandatory targets of the Kyoto Protocol. Koizumi described the U.S. plan as "constructive" but urged further efforts, emphasizing the importance of aligning global efforts to combat climate change. Bush argued that the Kyoto Protocol would harm the U.S. economy, while environmentalists criticized his alternative as ineffective, predicting rising emissions. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed to cooperate on developing new technologies to address global warming, which they believe could benefit both the environment and economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
