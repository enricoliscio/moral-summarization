Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article discusses the US's climate change proposals and the EU's concerns. It mentions that the US plans are domestic but might not be sufficient. The EU prefers the Kyoto Protocol, which requires absolute reductions, unlike the US's intensity target that allows emissions to rise. The 1992 Convention requires stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, which the US isn't meeting.

I should note the key moral words: reduce, allows, fight, requires, prevent, lead, increase, take, extended, implement, step, ratification. I need to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll start by stating the EU's concern about the US proposals not reducing emissions enough. Then, contrast the US's intensity target with the Kyoto Protocol's requirements. Mention the 1992 Convention's goal and the US's failure to meet it. Highlight the projected emissions increase and the EU's preference for cap-and-trade systems.

I should also include the EU's determination to ratify Kyoto and their optimism about other countries joining. Finally, note their willingness to continue dialogue with the US.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is clear and the morally charged words are appropriately used.

SUMMARY:  
The EU is concerned that the US's domestic climate change proposals may not sufficiently reduce emissions to effectively fight climate change. The US's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute reductions despite economic growth. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, to which the US is a party, requires stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels to prevent dangerous climate change. However, the US plan does not lead to stabilization but instead increases absolute emissions. Current projections show a 33-39% increase above 1990 levels by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan and the delayed review of its effectiveness. The EU emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to assess whether the US effort matches the Kyoto Protocol's requirements. The EU is determined to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and continue its emission reduction path, hoping other major players like Japan and Russia will join. The EU will assess the US proposals further and remain open to dialogue.  
END OF SUMMARY.
