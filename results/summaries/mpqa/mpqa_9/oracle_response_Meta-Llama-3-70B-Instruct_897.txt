SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan will not effectively fight climate change, as it allows for further increases in absolute emissions. The plan's "intensity target" is not sufficient to reduce US emissions, and instead will lead to an increase in absolute emission levels. The EU notes that the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while the US plan does not take this necessary step. The EU is also critical of the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU is committed to implementing a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions, which it believes is a cost-effective measure to prevent dangerous climate change. The EU welcomes the US's effort to take action on climate change, but urges the US to take a more substantial step towards reducing emissions. The EU will continue to examine and assess the US's proposals and is willing to continue the dialogue.

END OF SUMMARY.
