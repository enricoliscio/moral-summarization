SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change. The plan's "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, which is not a guaranteed way to reduce emissions. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires absolute emission reductions, which is the ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention that the US has subscribed to. The EU is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic that other major players will join in these efforts. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has put forward a plan, but it is only a first step in the right direction. The plan's voluntary nature and lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting are causes for concern. The EU will continue to examine and assess the proposals and is willing to continue the dialogue with the US. END OF SUMMARY.
