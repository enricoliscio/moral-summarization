SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan will not effectively reduce emissions. The plan's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US's greenhouse gas emissions intensity has been decreasing, but the plan only continues this trend, rather than stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels as required by the Climate Change Convention. The EU also criticizes the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. While the EU welcomes the US's effort, it believes mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess the plan's effectiveness. The EU will proceed with ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and continue to reduce emissions, hoping other major players will join.
