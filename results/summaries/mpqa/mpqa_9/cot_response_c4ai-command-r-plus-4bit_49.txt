SUMMARY:
The EU expresses its concern over the US's domestic proposals for addressing climate change, which fall short of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The "intensity target" proposed by the US allows for an increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention, which aim to stabilize emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. The EU is concerned that the voluntary nature of the US actions and the delay in reviewing their effectiveness until 2012 are not sufficient to address this global issue effectively. They highlight the benefits of implementing cap-and-trade programs for CO2 emissions from the power sector, similar to those for other air pollutants. The EU welcomes the completion of the US policy review but believes mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess the comparability of the US efforts with those under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains determined to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and is optimistic about the continued cooperation of major players like Japan and Russia. They are willing to continue the dialogue with the US and further assess President Bush's proposals in the coming weeks. END OF SUMMARY.
