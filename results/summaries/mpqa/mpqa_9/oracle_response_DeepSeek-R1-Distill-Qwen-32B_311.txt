Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a news article about US climate change proposals and the EU's concerns. They also listed morally framed words that the author used, which I need to include in the summary.

First, I should read through the article to get the main points. It seems the EU is concerned that the US's proposals aren't sufficient to reduce emissions. The US plan uses an intensity target, which allows emissions to increase, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires reductions. The 1992 Convention required stabilizing emissions, but the US plan doesn't meet that. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they're implementing, and they're moving forward with Kyoto while assessing the US plan.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words: reduce, allows, fight, requires, prevent, lead, increase, take, extended, implement, step, ratification. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating the EU's concern about the US proposals not reducing emissions enough. Mention the intensity target allowing increases, contrasting with Kyoto's requirements. Highlight the 1992 Convention's goal of stabilizing emissions, which the US plan doesn't achieve. Note the EU's preference for cap-and-trade and their plan to implement it. Also, include their determination to ratify Kyoto and their optimism about other countries joining.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure the summary step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately used. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, covering the EU's concerns, the US plan's shortcomings, the EU's actions, and their willingness to continue dialogue.

Wait, I should also mention the Bush plan's business-as-usual approach and the projected emissions increase. That adds context to the EU's concerns. Also, the lack of mandatory monitoring in the US plan is a point to include, as it relates to assessing the effort.

I think I've covered all the key points and included the necessary moral words. Let me make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as requested.

SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US climate change proposals, arguing they do not sufficiently reduce emissions. The US plan, based on an intensity target, allows for increased absolute emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized nations to reduce emissions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, to which the US is a party, requires stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels to prevent dangerous climate change. However, the US plan does not achieve this, leading to a projected 33% increase in emissions by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US actions and the lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which it plans to implement by 2005, covering 46% of its CO2 emissions. The EU welcomes the US plan as a potential step in the right direction but emphasizes the need for comparable efforts to those under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major players, like Japan and Russia, will join its efforts. The EU will assess the US proposals further and continue dialogue with the US. END OF SUMMARY.
