SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US proposals for climate change action are insufficient to reduce emissions. The "intensity target" allows for increases in absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US plan is based on a "business-as-usual" approach, with current emission projections indicating a 39% increase above 1990 levels by 2012. The EU also criticizes the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review mechanism until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of CO2 emissions by 2010. While welcoming the US's policy review, the EU believes that mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess the effectiveness of the proposals. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and will continue to engage in dialogue with the US.
