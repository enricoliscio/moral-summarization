SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan will not reduce emissions sufficiently to fight climate change. The plan's "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, which is not enough to prevent dangerous climate change. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions while still growing their economies. The EU notes that the US's plan does not lead to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, as required by the Climate Change Convention, but instead will lead to an increase in absolute emission levels. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review of effectiveness until 2012. The EU believes that a cap-and-trade system, which it plans to implement by 2005, is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. The EU will continue to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and is willing to continue dialogue with the US on its proposals.
