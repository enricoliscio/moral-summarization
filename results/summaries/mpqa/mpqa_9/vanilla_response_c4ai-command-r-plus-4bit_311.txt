SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's proposed action on climate change, stating that the "intensity target" may not be sufficient to effectively combat climate change and could lead to an increase in absolute emission levels. The EU believes that a cap-and-trade system is a more effective and flexible measure to reduce emissions. While the EU acknowledges that the Bush administration's proposals may be a step in the right direction, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess their true impact. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic that other major players will join in emission reduction efforts. The EU will continue to examine the US's proposals and is open to further dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
