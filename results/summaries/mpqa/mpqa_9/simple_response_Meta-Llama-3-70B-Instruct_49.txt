SUMMARY:

The EU expresses concerns over the US's proposed climate change plan, citing its inadequacy in reducing emissions. The plan's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU argues that the plan falls short of the Climate Change Convention's objective to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. Instead, it perpetuates a "business-as-usual" approach, with projected emissions increasing by 39% above 1990 levels in 2012. The EU criticizes the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. It advocates for a cap-and-trade system, which it believes is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While welcoming the US's efforts, the EU emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions to ensure comparability with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and continues to engage in dialogue with the US.
