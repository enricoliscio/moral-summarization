Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the US's climate change proposals and the EU's concerns. It mentions that the US proposals are domestic and might not be enough to reduce emissions. The EU is worried because the US plan allows for more emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires absolute reductions. 

The article also notes that the US hasn't stabilized emissions at 1990 levels as per the 1992 convention. The Bush plan is based on reducing emission intensity relative to GDP, which isn't enough. Projections show a 33% increase by 2012, which is still bad. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they're implementing by 2005. They're also moving forward with the Kyoto Protocol and hope others like Japan and Russia join. They want to assess the US plan further and keep talking.

So, the summary should cover the EU's concerns about the US plan, the comparison with Kyoto, the voluntary nature of the US approach, the lack of mandatory measures, and the EU's commitment to Kyoto and dialogue with the US.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes key points: US proposals, EU concerns, comparison with Kyoto, voluntary vs. mandatory, cap-and-trade, EU's actions, and the need for further assessment.

I'll structure it to first mention the EU's concerns, then the specifics of the US plan, the comparison, the EU's approach, and their next steps. Keep it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concerns over the US's domestic climate change proposals, arguing they may not sufficiently reduce emissions. The US plan focuses on reducing emissions intensity relative to GDP, allowing absolute emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires industrialized countries, including the US, to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels, a goal the US plan does not meet. Current projections suggest a 33% increase in US emissions by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan and the delayed review of its effectiveness. The EU favors a cap-and-trade system, which it plans to implement by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. While the EU acknowledges the US plan as a potential step forward, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and assessment to compare it with Kyoto standards. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major countries, like Japan and Russia, will join its efforts. It will continue to evaluate the US plan and engage in dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
