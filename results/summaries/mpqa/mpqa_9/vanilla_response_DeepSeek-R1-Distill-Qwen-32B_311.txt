Okay, I need to summarize this article about the EU's concerns regarding the US's climate change proposals. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the US proposals are domestic but the EU thinks they're not enough to reduce emissions. The US plan uses an intensity target, which allows absolute emissions to increase, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires absolute reductions. The US is a party to the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aims to stabilize GHG emissions at 1990 levels, but the new plan doesn't achieve that, leading to increased emissions instead.

Over the past years, the US's GHG intensity has been falling, but the Bush plan just continues this trend, resulting in a business-as-usual approach. Projections show a 39% increase by 2012, which might reduce to 33% with intensity improvements, but that's still a big increase. The EU is worried about the voluntary nature of the US actions and that effectiveness won't be reviewed until 2012.

The EU uses a cap-and-trade system for other pollutants but the US isn't applying it to CO2 from power plants. The EU thinks cap-and-trade is cost-effective and plans to implement it for 46% of emissions by 2005. They acknowledge the Bush plan as a first step but want mandatory monitoring and reporting to assess if it's comparable to Kyoto. The EU is determined to ratify Kyoto by June 2002 and hopes other countries like Japan and Russia will join. They'll continue examining the US proposals and keep talking with the US.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the EU's concerns about the US plan's adequacy, the intensity target vs. Kyoto's absolute reductions, the increase in emissions, the voluntary nature, lack of cap-and-trade, EU's own plans, and their willingness to engage in dialogue.

I'll structure it by first stating the EU's concerns about the US plan, then compare it to Kyoto, mention the emission projections, the EU's cap-and-trade approach, their support for the Bush plan as a step but with conditions, and their determination to proceed with Kyoto.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Let me draft it now.

SUMMARY: The EU expresses concerns over the US's climate change proposals, deeming them insufficient to reduce emissions effectively. The US plan focuses on intensity targets, allowing absolute emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, which the US has signed, aims to stabilize GHG emissions at 1990 levels, a goal the new plan fails to meet. Projections indicate a 33-39% increase in emissions by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US measures and the delayed review until 2012. While the EU supports the Bush plan as a potential step, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and a cap-and-trade system, which the US has not implemented for CO2. The EU plans to ratify Kyoto by June 2002 and hopes other nations will join. It will continue evaluating the US proposals and engaging in dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
