SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan will not effectively reduce emissions, as it allows for further increases in absolute emissions. The plan's "intensity target" is not sufficient to combat climate change, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US's greenhouse gas emissions intensity has been falling, but the new plan will still lead to an increase in absolute emissions. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review of their effectiveness until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of CO2 emissions by 2010. The EU welcomes the US's domestic climate change policy but believes it falls short of the efforts required under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU will continue to pursue its own emission reduction goals and engage in dialogue with the US.
