SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US proposals on climate change will not reduce emissions sufficiently to effectively fight climate change. The "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions. The US plan does not lead to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, as required by the Climate Change Convention, but instead will lead to an increase in absolute emission levels. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review of their effectiveness until 2012. A cap-and-trade system, which the EU considers a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions, is not extended to CO2 emissions from the power sector. The EU welcomes the US' first step in the right direction but emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions. The EU will proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and continue to reduce emissions, hoping other major players will join in these efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
