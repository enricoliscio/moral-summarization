SUMMARY: The EU has raised concerns about the voluntary nature and potential insufficiency of the US's domestic proposals for climate change action. The "intensity target" may lead to an increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions, with mandatory monitoring and reporting at the company level. While the Bush plan is a step in the right direction, it falls short of the emission stabilization needed to prevent dangerous climate change. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic about the efforts of other major players. The EU will continue to assess the US proposals and engage in dialogue.
