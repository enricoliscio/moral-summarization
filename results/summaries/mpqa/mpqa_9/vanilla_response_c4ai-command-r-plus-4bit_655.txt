SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's domestic proposals for addressing climate change, arguing that they are insufficient to reduce US emissions effectively. The US's "intensity target" allows for increasing absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirements for industrialized nations to reduce emissions while growing their economies. The EU emphasizes the need for absolute emission reductions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations and prevent dangerous climate change. The Bush plan, based on continuing the current trend, will lead to a substantial increase in emissions by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the proposed actions and the lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting of company-level emissions. The EU supports a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While welcoming the completion of the US policy review, the EU believes that mandatory measures and absolute emission reductions are necessary to align with the efforts under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and is optimistic about the involvement of other major players. The EU will continue to examine and assess the US proposals and is open to further dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
