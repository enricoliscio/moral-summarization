SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's proposed plan of action to address climate change, highlighting its potential ineffectiveness in reducing emissions and its voluntary nature. The US plan, based on an "intensity target," allows for increased absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirements for industrialized nations to reduce emissions. The EU suggests that a cap-and-trade system, similar to those used for other air pollutants, would be a more effective approach. They emphasize the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of company-level emissions to properly assess the US's efforts compared to the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic about the potential for other major players, like Japan and Russia, to join their emission reduction efforts. They plan to further examine and discuss the US's proposals in the coming weeks. END OF SUMMARY.
