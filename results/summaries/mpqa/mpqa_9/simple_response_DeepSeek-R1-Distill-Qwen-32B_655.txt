Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the EU's concerns regarding the US's climate change proposals. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The US's proposals are domestic and might not be enough to reduce emissions. The EU is worried because the US's intensity target allows for higher emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires absolute reductions. The US hasn't met the 1992 Convention's goal, and their new plan doesn't help stabilize emissions either. 

The article mentions that the US's emissions are projected to increase, even with intensity improvements. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they'll implement by 2005, covering a large portion of their emissions. They're moving forward with Kyoto and hope others like Japan and Russia will join.

I need to capture the EU's criticism of the US's approach, their preference for mandatory measures, and their determination to proceed with Kyoto. The summary should highlight the moral stance, emphasizing the EU's view that the US isn't doing enough and the importance of binding commitments.

I'll structure the summary to first state the EU's concerns about the US proposals, then compare the US approach to the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Convention. I'll mention the projected emissions increase, the EU's cap-and-trade system, their commitment to Kyoto, and their hope for others to join. Finally, I'll note their willingness to continue dialogue with the US.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”emphasizing the need for stronger, binding actions to combat climate change effectively.

SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concerns about the US's climate change proposals, arguing they fall short of effectively addressing global emissions. While the US focuses on intensity targets, allowing absolute emissions to rise, the EU emphasizes the need for absolute reductions as per the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan, noting it lacks mandatory measures and delayed effectiveness reviews. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of its CO2 emissions by 2005, viewing it as a cost-effective approach. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major emitters, like Japan and Russia, will join its efforts. While the EU acknowledges the US's domestic initiatives, it stresses the need for mandatory monitoring and comparable efforts to those under Kyoto. The EU will continue dialogue with the US but maintains its focus on binding international commitments to combat climate change effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
