Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US's proposals on climate change action, specifically under President Bush. It mentions that the EU is concerned these proposals aren't sufficient. The US plan uses an "intensity target," which allows for increased absolute emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol that requires actual reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires industrialized countries to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels, but the US plan doesn't meet this. Instead, US emissions are projected to increase significantly by 2012. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they find more effective and cost-efficient.

The EU is also worried about the voluntary nature of the US plan and the lack of mandatory monitoring. They plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other countries like Japan and Russia will join. They're willing to engage in dialogue with the US but are critical of the current plan's adequacy.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The author seems critical of the US's approach, highlighting that it's insufficient compared to the EU's more stringent measures. The moral angle is about the responsibility to take effective action against climate change and the adequacy of the measures taken.

I'll start by stating the EU's concerns about the US proposals, then contrast the US approach with the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Convention. Mention the projected emissions increase, the EU's preference for cap-and-trade, their criticism of the voluntary measures, and their determination to proceed with Kyoto. Conclude with their willingness to dialogue but emphasis on the need for stronger measures.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral perspective is clearâ€”highlighting the US's shortcomings and the EU's more responsible approach.

SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's climate change proposals, arguing they fall short of effectively combating global warming. While the US plan focuses on reducing emissions intensity relative to GDP, it allows absolute emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, a goal the US plan fails to meet. Projections show US emissions increasing by 33-39% above 1990 levels by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan and the delayed review of its effectiveness. It prefers a cap-and-trade system, which it deems cost-effective and environmentally guaranteed, and plans to implement one covering 46% of its emissions by 2005. The EU acknowledges the US plan as a potential first step but emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and comparable efforts to Kyoto. It remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major countries will join its efforts. The EU will assess the US proposals further and engage in dialogue, but underscores the necessity for stronger action to address climate change effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
