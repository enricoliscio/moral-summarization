SUMMARY: The EU is concerned about the inadequacy of the US's domestic proposals to address climate change, specifically their focus on intensity targets that allow for increasing absolute emissions. This approach contradicts the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aim for absolute emission reductions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations and prevent dangerous climate change. The EU believes that mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at the company level are necessary to properly assess the effectiveness of the US's plans. While the Bush administration's policies may be a step in the right direction, the EU emphasizes the need for a cap-and-trade system to ensure guaranteed environmental results and cost-effectiveness. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and encourages other major players to join in emission reduction efforts, while also offering to continue the dialogue with the US.
