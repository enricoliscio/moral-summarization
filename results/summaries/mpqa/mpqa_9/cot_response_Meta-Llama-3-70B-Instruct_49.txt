SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US proposals on climate change are insufficient to reduce emissions, allowing for further increases in absolute emissions. The "intensity target" proposed is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement of absolute emission reductions. The EU is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. In contrast, the Bush plan is based on a "business-as-usual" path, leading to a substantial increase in absolute emissions. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has put forward its policy review, but considers mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions necessary to adequately assess the proposals. The EU will continue to examine and assess the proposals and is willing to continue the dialogue with the US. END OF SUMMARY.
