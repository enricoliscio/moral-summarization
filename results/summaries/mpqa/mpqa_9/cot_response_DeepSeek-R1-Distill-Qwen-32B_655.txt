Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about the EU's concerns regarding the US's climate change proposals. The EU thinks the US's plans aren't sufficient because they allow for increased emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires reductions. The article mentions the US's "intensity target" and how it's not enough, leading to higher emissions. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they see as more effective and fair. They're moving forward with the Kyoto Protocol and hope others join them, while they'll evaluate the US's proposals further.

Now, for the first part, I need to identify all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a value judgment or imply a moral stance. Let me go through the text again:
