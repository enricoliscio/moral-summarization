SUMMARY:

The EU expresses concern over the US's proposed climate change plan, citing that it will not reduce emissions sufficiently to combat climate change. The plan's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US's plan is based on a "business-as-usual" approach, with current emission projections indicating a 39% increase above 1990 levels by 2012. The EU criticizes the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. While the EU welcomes the US's effort, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to ensure comparable efforts to the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and reducing emissions, urging other major players to join.
