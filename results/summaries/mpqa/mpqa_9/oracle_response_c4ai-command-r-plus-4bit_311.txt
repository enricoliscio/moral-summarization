SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's proposed action plan on climate change, highlighting that it may not be sufficient to effectively fight climate change. The plan, based on an "intensity target," allows for increasing absolute emissions, contrary to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aim to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. The current US plan is projected to lead to a substantial increase in emissions by 2012. The voluntary nature of the actions and the lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting at the company level are also concerning. The EU suggests that a cap-and-trade system, similar to those implemented for other air pollutants, would be a more effective measure. While the EU acknowledges that the Bush administration's proposals may represent a step in the right direction, they emphasize the need for further examination and assessment of the plan. The EU remains committed to reducing emissions, ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, and encouraging other major players to join these efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
