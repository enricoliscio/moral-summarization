SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concern over the US's proposed plan of action on climate change, highlighting its potential inadequacy in reducing emissions and its voluntary nature. The "intensity target" proposed by the US may lead to an increase in absolute emission levels, falling short of the required stabilization or reduction in emissions to combat climate change effectively. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to guarantee environmental results and reduce emissions. While the EU acknowledges that the Bush administration's proposals may be a step in the right direction, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess their true impact. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic that other major players will join in emission reduction efforts. The EU will continue to examine the US proposals and is open to further dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
