SUMMARY:

The EU expresses concerns over the US's proposed climate change plan, citing that it will not effectively reduce emissions and may even lead to an increase in absolute emissions. The plan's "intensity target" allows for further increases in emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU emphasizes that the US's plan is insufficient to combat climate change, as it only prolongs the current trend of decreasing emissions intensity, rather than stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels as required by the Climate Change Convention. The EU also criticizes the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, which it believes is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. The EU welcomes the US's efforts but stresses the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to ensure comparable efforts to the Kyoto Protocol.
