SUMMARY: The EU raises concerns about the insufficiency of the US's domestic proposals for climate change action, highlighting their potential inadequacy in reducing US emissions. The "intensity target" proposed may lead to rising absolute emission levels, contradicting the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU advocates for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions, emphasizing the need for comparable efforts to the Kyoto Protocol. By 2005, the EU plans to enforce a cap-and-trade system, targeting a substantial portion of CO2 emissions. While welcoming the Bush administration's policy review completion, the EU believes the proposals represent a mere first step. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and urges other major players to join emission reduction efforts. The EU will further assess President Bush's proposals and continue the dialogue with the US on this critical issue. END OF SUMMARY.
