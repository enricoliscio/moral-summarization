Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the US climate change proposals and the EU's concerns. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that the US proposals are domestic, meaning they're focused on the US's own actions. The EU is worried these proposals aren't enough to reduce US emissions. The US plan uses an "intensity target," which allows absolute emissions to increase. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce absolute emissions, even as their economies grow. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, which the US is part of, requires stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels as a first step. However, the new US plan doesn't achieve this; instead, emissions are expected to rise.

The article mentions that over the past years, the US has seen a decrease in emissions intensity relative to GDP. The Bush plan extends this trend, which is similar to a "business-as-usual" approach. Projections show a 39% increase in emissions by 2012, which might reduce to 33% with intensity improvementsâ€”still a significant rise. The EU is concerned about the voluntary nature of the US actions and the delayed review until 2012.

The EU prefers cap-and-trade systems, which they find cost-effective and effective for reducing emissions. They plan to implement such a system by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. The EU acknowledges the Bush plan as a step but questions its effectiveness compared to Kyoto. They're committed to ratifying Kyoto by June 2002 and hope other countries like Japan and Russia will join. The EU will assess the US proposals further and continue dialogue.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: US proposals are domestic and insufficient, EU's concerns about voluntary measures and lack of absolute emission reduction, comparison with Kyoto and the 1992 Convention, emission projections, EU's cap-and-trade approach, and their commitment to Kyoto and future dialogue.

I should structure the summary to first state the US proposals' nature, then the EU's concerns, followed by the comparison with international agreements, emission numbers, EU's preferred methods, and their stance on continuing dialogue. I'll make sure to keep it concise, hitting all these points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the US's domestic climate change proposals and the EU's concerns about their adequacy. The US plan focuses on reducing emissions intensity relative to GDP, allowing absolute emissions to increase. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention require absolute reductions and stabilization of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels. The US plan is criticized for being voluntary and insufficient, with projections showing a 33-39% increase in emissions by 2012. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which it plans to implement by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. The EU acknowledges the Bush plan as a step but questions its effectiveness compared to Kyoto. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other countries will join its efforts. It will continue to assess the US proposals and engage in dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
