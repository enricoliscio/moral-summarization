SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the US's domestic proposals for addressing climate change, arguing that they may not sufficiently reduce emissions. The US's "intensity target" may lead to absolute emission increases, contrary to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU worries that the voluntary nature of the proposals and the delay in reviewing their effectiveness until 2012 may hinder progress. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While the EU acknowledges the Bush administration's efforts and recognizes the involvement of economic operators in emission control, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting at the company level to assess the effectiveness of the proposals. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic about the efforts of other major players. The EU will continue to examine the US proposals and is open to further dialogue.
