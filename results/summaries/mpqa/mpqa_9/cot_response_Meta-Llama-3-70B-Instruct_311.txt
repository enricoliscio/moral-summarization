SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US proposals for climate change action are insufficient to reduce emissions, allowing for further increases in absolute emissions. The "intensity target" is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. In contrast, the Bush plan leads to an increase in absolute emission levels, a "business-as-usual" path. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has completed its policy review, but is willing to continue the dialogue to assess the proposals' effectiveness. The EU is optimistic that other major players will join in its efforts to reduce emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
