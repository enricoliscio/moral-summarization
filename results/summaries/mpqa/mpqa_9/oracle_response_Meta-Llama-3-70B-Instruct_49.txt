SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US proposals on climate change will not reduce emissions sufficiently to effectively fight climate change. The "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US is a Party to the Climate Change Convention of 1992, which requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, but the new plan will lead to an increase in absolute emission levels. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review of their effectiveness until 2012. In contrast, the EU intends to implement a cap-and-trade system, which is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions and combines a guaranteed environmental result with flexibility. The EU welcomes the US's first step in the right direction but will continue to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and encourage other major players to join in emission reduction efforts.
