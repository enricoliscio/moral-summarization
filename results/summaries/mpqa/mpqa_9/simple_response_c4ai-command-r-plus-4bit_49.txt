SUMMARY: The European Union is concerned about the insufficiency of the United States' domestic proposals to address climate change, specifically their focus on intensity targets that allow for increasing absolute emissions. The EU emphasizes the need for absolute emission reductions as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, to which the US is a party. The EU questions the voluntary nature of the proposed actions and the absence of a cap-and-trade system for CO2 emissions from the power sector. They view a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure that guarantees environmental results while providing flexibility. The EU intends to implement its own cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering 46% of all CO2 emissions by 2010. While recognizing the Bush administration's efforts, the EU believes mandatory monitoring and reporting of company-level emissions are necessary to assess the comparability of the US proposals with the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and encourages other major players, such as Japan and Russia, to join their emission reduction efforts. The EU will continue to examine the US proposals and is open to further dialogue with the US on this basis. END OF SUMMARY.
