SUMMARY:

The EU is concerned that the US proposals on climate change will not reduce emissions sufficiently to fight climate change effectively. The "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU is committed to reducing emissions and preventing dangerous climate change, as required by the Climate Change Convention of 1992. In contrast, the Bush plan leads to an increase in absolute emission levels, taking a "business-as-usual" approach. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review mechanism until 2012. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system, which is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions and combines a guaranteed environmental result with flexibility. The EU will proceed with ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and continue to reduce emissions, while examining and assessing the US proposals. END OF SUMMARY.
