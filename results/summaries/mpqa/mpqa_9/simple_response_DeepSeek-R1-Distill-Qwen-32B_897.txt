Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the EU's reaction to the US's climate change proposals. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the original text seems to present the EU's perspective as more responsible and proactive compared to the US's approach. I should make sure that tone comes through in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The US's proposals are domestic and not sufficient for reducing emissions. The EU is concerned because the US's "intensity target" allows emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires absolute reductions. The EU has a cap-and-trade system planned, which they see as more effective and cost-efficient. They're also critical of the US's voluntary measures and lack of mandatory monitoring.

I need to highlight the contrast between the EU's commitment and the US's approach. The EU is moving forward with Kyoto, expecting others like Japan and Russia to join, while the US's plan is seen as insufficient. I should mention the EU's optimism about others joining them and their willingness to dialogue with the US.

I should structure the summary to first state the EU's concerns about the US's proposals, then outline the EU's own initiatives, and conclude with their stance on future actions. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but include all key points.

Also, I need to use the "SUMMARY:" token at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end. Let me make sure to include the main elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concern over the US's climate change proposals, arguing they are insufficient to reduce emissions effectively. While the US focuses on an "intensity target" that allows absolute emissions to rise, the EU emphasizes the need for absolute reductions as required by the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU highlights its planned cap-and-trade system, which it views as a cost-effective and environmentally guaranteed approach to reducing emissions. In contrast, the US's voluntary measures and delayed effectiveness review are criticized as inadequate. The EU commends the US for taking a step toward emission control but stresses the need for mandatory monitoring to assess efforts comparable to the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and expects other major players like Japan and Russia to join its efforts. It will continue to evaluate the US's proposals and maintain dialogue, emphasizing its proactive and responsible approach to combating climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
