SUMMARY: The EU expresses concern over the insufficiency of the US's domestic proposals for addressing climate change, highlighting that the "intensity target" falls short of the absolute emission reductions mandated by the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The Bush plan, based on projected trends, could lead to a substantial increase in absolute emission levels. The voluntary nature of the actions and the delay in reviewing their effectiveness until 2012 are also worrisome. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions, ensuring environmental results with flexibility. While recognizing the US's domestic efforts, the EU stresses the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting at the company level to assess the comparability of the US's proposals with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and encourages other major players to join emission reduction efforts. The EU will examine the US's proposals further and is open to continued dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
