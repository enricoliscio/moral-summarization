Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US proposals on climate action, specifically mentioning that they're domestic. The EU is concerned that these proposals aren't enough to reduce US emissions. The US plan uses an "intensity target," which allows absolute emissions to increase, which isn't effective against climate change. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce emissions absolutely, even with growing economies. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, which the US is part of, requires stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, a first step towards preventing dangerous climate change. The US plan doesn't stabilize emissions but increases them.

The US emissions are projected to rise 39% above 1990 levels by 2012, and the plan might reduce that to 33%, which is still a big increase. The EU is worried about the voluntary nature of the US actions and the lack of review until 2012. They also note that the US isn't using cap-and-trade for CO2 from power, which the EU finds cost-effective. The EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of emissions by 2005. They welcome the US's step but question if it's comparable to Kyoto. The EU will ratify Kyoto by June 2002 and hopes other countries like Japan and Russia join. They'll assess the US plan further and keep talking with the US.

So, the summary should include the key points: US proposals are domestic, EU concerns about their adequacy, comparison with Kyoto and 1992 Convention, emission projections, voluntary nature, lack of cap-and-trade, EU's plans, and their hope for others to join.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, highlighting each main point briefly.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the US's domestic climate change proposals, which the EU finds insufficient for reducing emissions. The US plan uses an "intensity target," allowing absolute emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, a goal the US plan doesn't meet, leading to a projected 33-39% increase by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US actions and the delay in reviewing their effectiveness until 2012. The US isn't using cap-and-trade for CO2 from power, a method the EU deems cost-effective. The EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of emissions by 2005 and aims to ratify Kyoto by June 2002. They welcome the US's step but question its comparability to Kyoto. The EU hopes other countries like Japan and Russia will join their efforts and will assess the US plan further. END OF SUMMARY.
