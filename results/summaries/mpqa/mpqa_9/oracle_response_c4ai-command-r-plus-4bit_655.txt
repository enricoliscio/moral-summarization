SUMMARY: The EU raises concerns about the insufficiency of the US's domestic proposals to address climate change, highlighting that the "intensity target" may lead to an increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The current US plan falls short of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing dangerous climate change. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions, ensuring environmental results with flexibility. While the EU acknowledges the Bush administration's efforts and their engagement with economic operators, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are needed to assess the comparability of the US proposals with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and is optimistic about the efforts of other major players. The EU will continue to examine the US proposals and engage in dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
