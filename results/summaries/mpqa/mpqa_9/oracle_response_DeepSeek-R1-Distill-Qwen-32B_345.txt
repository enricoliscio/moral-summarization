Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the US and EU's approaches to climate change, specifically comparing the US's proposals with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU's stance. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The US's proposals are domestic and not enough to reduce emissions. They use an intensity target, which allows emissions to increase. The EU is concerned because their approach requires absolute reductions, which the US isn't doing. The article mentions the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which the US is part of, requiring stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels. The US's plan doesn't meet this and instead increases emissions. The EU is pushing for a cap-and-trade system, which they think is more effective.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: reduce, allows, fight, requires, prevent, lead, increase, take, extended, implement, step, ratification. I should make sure these words are included in the summary as much as possible.

I should structure the summary to highlight the contrast between the US and EU approaches. The US's plan is insufficient, while the EU is committed to the Kyoto Protocol and a cap-and-trade system. I need to mention the specific targets, like the 39% increase in emissions and the EU's intention to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of CO2 emissions by 2005.

I also need to note the EU's willingness to continue dialogue with the US, showing their openness despite concerns. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include all the key moral terms.

Let me start drafting. I'll begin by stating the EU's concern about the US proposals not being sufficient. Then, I'll mention the intensity target and how it allows emissions to increase. I'll contrast this with the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Convention. I'll include the projected emissions increase and the EU's cap-and-trade plan. Finally, I'll note the EU's determination to ratify Kyoto and their openness to dialogue with the US.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms without being too verbose. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I think that's covered. 

Alright, I think I have a solid summary that meets all the requirements. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY: The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate action plans are insufficient to reduce emissions and fail to meet the requirements of the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aims to prevent dangerous climate change. The US's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions. Current projections show US emissions will increase by 39% above 1990 levels by 2012, with the proposed measures only reducing this to 33%. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan and the lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting. It emphasizes the need to implement a cap-and-trade system, which it views as a cost-effective and environmentally beneficial approach. The EU plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and continue its emission reduction efforts, hoping other major countries will join. It remains open to dialogue with the US but stresses the need for comparable efforts to those under the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
