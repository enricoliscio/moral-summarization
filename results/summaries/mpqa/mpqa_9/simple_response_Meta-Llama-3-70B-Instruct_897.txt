SUMMARY:

The EU is disappointed with the US's proposed climate change plan, citing that it will not effectively reduce emissions and instead allows for further increases. The plan's "intensity target" is deemed insufficient, as it does not require absolute emission reductions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol. The EU notes that the US's proposal is based on a "business-as-usual" approach, which will lead to a substantial increase in absolute emissions. The EU is also concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review process until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, which it believes is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. The EU welcomes the US's effort but emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions to assess the proposal's effectiveness. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and will continue to engage in dialogue with the US.
