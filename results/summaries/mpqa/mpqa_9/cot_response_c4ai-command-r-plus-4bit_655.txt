SUMMARY:
The EU expresses its concern about the US proposals for climate change action, which it deems insufficient to effectively address the issue. The proposed "intensity target" allows for increasing absolute emissions, contrary to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aim for absolute emission reductions and stabilization, respectively. The EU finds it concerning that the suggested approach is purely voluntary and does not include a cap-and-trade system for CO2 emissions from the power sector, which they view as a beneficial and necessary measure. The EU intends to proceed with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and is determined to continue its emission reduction efforts, welcoming the first step represented by President Bush's proposals. However, they emphasize the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to adequately assess the comparability of efforts under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU will further examine the US proposals and is willing to continue the dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
