SUMMARY: The EU is concerned about the insufficiency of the US proposals to combat climate change, highlighting that the "intensity target" may lead to an increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The current plan falls short of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing dangerous climate change. The EU emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions, contrasting the voluntary nature of the US proposals. A cap-and-trade system, as planned by the EU, is viewed as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While recognizing the Bush administration's efforts, the EU believes further steps are needed to align with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and encourages other major players to join emission reduction efforts. The dialogue between the EU and the US on this matter will continue.
