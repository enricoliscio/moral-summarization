SUMMARY: The EU is *concerned* that the US proposals for climate change action are not *sufficient*. The "intensity target" proposed does not lead to *absolute* emission reductions and is therefore not *necessary* to effectively fight climate change. The Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, to which the US is a party, *require* industrialised countries to achieve *stabilising* of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. The new US plan, based on a *prolongation* of the current trend, will lead to a substantial increase in emissions by 2012. The EU finds the voluntary nature of the proposed actions *striking* and believes a cap-and-trade system is a more *effective* measure. By 2005, the EU *intends* to implement such a system covering almost half of all CO2 emissions by 2010. While the EU *welcomes* the completion of the US policy review, it believes mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are *necessary* to assess the *adequately* of the proposed efforts. The EU remains *optimistic* about the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and is *willing* to continue dialogue with the US on this basis. END OF SUMMARY.
