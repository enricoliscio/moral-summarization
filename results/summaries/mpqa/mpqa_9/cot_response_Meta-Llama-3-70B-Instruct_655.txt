SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan is not sufficient to reduce emissions effectively, allowing for further increases in absolute emissions. The plan's "intensity target" is not enough to fight climate change, and the EU is worried that it will lead to a substantial increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has put forward a plan, but is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. The EU believes that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions, combining a guaranteed environmental result with flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly.
