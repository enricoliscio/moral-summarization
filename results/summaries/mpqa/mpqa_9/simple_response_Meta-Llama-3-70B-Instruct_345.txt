SUMMARY:

The EU is disappointed with the US's proposed climate change plan, which allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is deemed insufficient to effectively fight climate change. The plan's "intensity target" approach is criticized for not leading to absolute emission reductions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to achieve such reductions. The EU is concerned about the voluntary nature of the actions proposed and the lack of a review mechanism until 2012. The EU advocates for a cap-and-trade system, which it believes is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While the EU welcomes the US's effort to take some action, it emphasizes that mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess the effectiveness of the proposals. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and reducing emissions, and is willing to continue dialogue with the US.
