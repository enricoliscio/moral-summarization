Okay, I need to summarize this news article about US climate change proposals and the EU's response. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by saying that the US proposals are domestic, but the EU is worried they're not enough to reduce emissions. The US plan uses an intensity target, which allows absolute emissions to increase. The EU points out that the Kyoto Protocol requires absolute reductions, even with growing economies. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires industrialized countries to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels, which is just a first step. The US plan doesn't meet this, leading to higher emissions.

The US's greenhouse gas intensity has been falling relative to GDP, and the Bush plan continues this trend, leading to a "business-as-usual" approach. Projections show a 39% increase by 2012, which might drop to 33% with intensity improvements, but it's still a significant rise. The EU is concerned about the voluntary nature and the delayed effectiveness review until 2012.

The EU uses cap-and-trade for other pollutants but the US isn't applying it to CO2 from power. The EU thinks cap-and-trade is cost-effective and will implement it by 2005 covering 46% of emissions. They welcome the Bush plan as a first step but note the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to compare with Kyoto. The EU will ratify Kyoto by June 2002 and hopes others like Japan and Russia join. They'll assess the US plan further and keep dialogue open.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: US proposals are domestic, EU's concerns about insufficient reductions, comparison with Kyoto and the 1992 Convention, the US's intensity target leading to higher emissions, EU's cap-and-trade approach, their plan to ratify Kyoto, and the need for monitoring in the US plan.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the US proposals, EU's concerns, comparison with international agreements, the specifics of the US plan, EU's actions, and their determination to proceed with Kyoto.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's concise and within the limit. I'll make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The US has proposed domestic climate change measures, but the EU is concerned they are insufficient to reduce emissions. The US plan focuses on intensity targets, allowing absolute emissions to rise, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which requires absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention mandates stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels, a goal the US plan fails to meet, leading to a projected 33-39% increase by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US plan and the delayed effectiveness review until 2012. The EU favors cap-and-trade systems for cost-effective emission reductions and plans to implement one covering 46% of CO2 emissions by 2005. While welcoming the US plan as a first step, the EU emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to assess its effectiveness compared to Kyoto. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major countries like Japan and Russia will join its efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
