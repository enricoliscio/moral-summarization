SUMMARY:
The EU expresses its concerns about the insufficient nature of the US proposals to address climate change, highlighting that the intensity target may lead to increased absolute emission levels, contrary to the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the Climate Change Convention. The purely voluntary nature of the actions and the lack of mandatory monitoring and reporting are also concerning. The EU welcomes the completion of the US policy review and acknowledges that the proposals may be a first step in the right direction. However, they stress the need for mandatory emission assessments to compare the efforts with those under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains determined to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic that other major players will join their emission reduction efforts. They are willing to continue the dialogue with the US and further assess President Bush's proposals. The EU is striking in its opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective and flexible measure to reduce emissions. Overall, the EU is concerned about the potential ineffectiveness of the US plan and advocates for more ambitious and binding actions to combat climate change.
