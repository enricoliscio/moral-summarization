SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concern over the US's proposed plan of action on climate change, stating that it may not be sufficient to effectively reduce emissions and combat climate change. The US plan, based on an "intensity target," allows for an increase in absolute emissions, contrary to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU believes that a cap-and-trade system is a more effective approach, and intends to implement such a system by 2005. While the EU acknowledges that the Bush administration's proposals may be a step in the right direction, they emphasize the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions to properly assess the effectiveness of the plan. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and is optimistic that other major players will join their emission reduction efforts. The EU will continue to examine the US proposals and is open to further dialogue with the US on this basis. END OF SUMMARY.
