Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article compares the US and EU approaches to climate change. The US has domestic proposals that aren't sufficient, allowing emissions to rise. The EU is concerned and prefers the Kyoto Protocol with absolute reductions. I should highlight the US's intensity targets vs. the EU's cap-and-trade system. Also, mention the EU's determination to ratify Kyoto and hopes for other countries to join. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and focus on the moral aspects like sufficiency and commitment.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the EU's concerns about the US's climate change proposals, which are domestically focused but insufficient to reduce emissions effectively. The US plan allows for increased absolute emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates absolute reductions for industrialized countries. The 1992 Climate Change Convention, to which the US is a signatory, requires stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, a step toward preventing dangerous climate change. However, the US plan does not achieve this, leading to a 33-39% increase in emissions by 2012. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US measures and the delay in reviewing their effectiveness until 2012. The EU favors a cap-and-trade system, which it plans to implement by 2005, covering 46% of its CO2 emissions. While the EU acknowledges the US's effort, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and comparable efforts to the Kyoto Protocol. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major countries, like Japan and Russia, will join its efforts. It will continue dialogues with the US to assess the proposals further. END OF SUMMARY.
