SUMMARY:
The EU is concerned that the US's proposed climate change plan is insufficient to effectively fight climate change. The plan's "intensity target" allows for further increases in absolute emissions, which is not sufficient to achieve the ultimate objective of stabilizing global greenhouse gas concentrations. The EU is determined to proceed with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions. In contrast, the US plan is based on a "business-as-usual" path, which will lead to a substantial increase in absolute emissions. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has put forward a plan, but is optimistic that other major players will join them in their efforts to reduce emissions. The EU will continue to examine and assess the US proposals, emphasizing the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions to ensure an adequate effort. END OF SUMMARY.
