SUMMARY:
The EU expresses its concerns about the US's domestic proposals for addressing climate change, highlighting their potential insufficiency in reducing emissions. The "intensity target" proposed by the US may lead to an increase in absolute emission levels, contradicting the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention. The EU deems mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at the company level necessary to properly assess the effectiveness of the US's plans. The EU remains determined to proceed with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and is optimistic about the commitment of other major players. While recognizing the Bush administration's efforts as a first step in the right direction, the EU stresses the voluntary nature of the proposed actions and their potential inadequacy in combating climate change. The EU is willing to continue the dialogue with the US while further examining the proposals in the coming weeks. The EU believes that a cap-and-trade system is a beneficial and cost-effective approach to reducing emissions, ensuring environmental results with flexibility. The EU intends to implement such a system by 2005, covering a significant portion of CO2 emissions. While acknowledging the US's domestic climate policy direction, the EU encourages mandatory emission assessments to ensure a comparable effort to the Kyoto Protocol.
