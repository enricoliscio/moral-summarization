SUMMARY: The EU has expressed concern over the adequacy of the US proposals for action on climate change, which are purely domestic and based on an "intensity target" that allows for increasing absolute emissions. This approach falls short of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Climate Change Convention, which aim to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and prevent dangerous climate change. The Bush plan, with its voluntary nature and delay in reviewing effectiveness, is projected to result in a substantial increase in absolute emissions by 2012. In contrast, the EU is committed to implementing a cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering a significant portion of CO2 emissions, as a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions. While the EU acknowledges that President Bush's proposals may be a step in the right direction, mandatory monitoring and reporting of company-level emissions are necessary to assess their true impact. The EU remains dedicated to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and continuing its emission reduction efforts, hoping that other major players will join. The EU is willing to engage in further dialogue with the US based on a thorough assessment of President Bush's proposals in the coming weeks. END OF SUMMARY.
