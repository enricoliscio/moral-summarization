SUMMARY:

The European Union (EU) has expressed concerns over the US's proposed climate change plan, citing that it may not be sufficient to reduce emissions. The plan's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, contradicting the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the US's greenhouse gas emissions intensity has been falling, but the new plan only continues this trend, leading to a 33% increase in absolute emissions by 2012. The EU also criticizes the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of CO2 emissions by 2010. While welcoming the US's effort, the EU emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and will continue to engage in dialogue with the US on climate change policy.
