SUMMARY:

The EU has expressed concerns over the US's proposed climate change plan, citing that it will not reduce emissions sufficiently to combat climate change. The plan's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, contrary to the Kyoto Protocol's requirement for absolute emission reductions. The EU notes that the plan is based on a "business-as-usual" approach, with current emission projections indicating a 39% increase above 1990 levels by 2012. The EU is also critical of the plan's voluntary nature and lack of review until 2012. In contrast, the EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions in 2010. While the EU welcomes the US's efforts, it believes mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions are necessary to assess the plan's effectiveness. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and will continue to engage in dialogue with the US.
