Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article compares the US's climate change proposals with the EU's stance. The US's plan is domestic but not sufficient to reduce emissions effectively. The EU is concerned because the US's intensity target allows for increased emissions, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires absolute reductions. The 1992 Climate Change Convention requires industrialized countries, including the US, to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels, but the US's plan doesn't meet this.

The article mentions that the US's greenhouse gas intensity has been falling, but their plan is just a continuation of business-as-usual, leading to a 33% increase in emissions by 2012. The EU prefers a cap-and-trade system, which they find more effective and cost-efficient. They plan to implement this by 2005, covering 46% of CO2 emissions. The EU acknowledges the Bush administration's effort as a step in the right direction but wants mandatory monitoring and reporting to assess if it's comparable to Kyoto.

The EU is determined to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other countries like Japan and Russia will join. They will continue to dialogue with the US on these proposals.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words: reduce, allows, fight, requires, prevent, lead, increase, take, extended, implement, step, ratification.

I should structure the summary to highlight the US's insufficient plan, the EU's concerns, the comparison with Kyoto, the need for mandatory measures, and the EU's determination with ratification.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include those words and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the EU's concerns over the US's climate change proposals, which are domestic but insufficient to reduce emissions effectively. The US's "intensity target" allows for increased absolute emissions, failing to fight climate change adequately. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while the 1992 Climate Change Convention requires stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels to prevent dangerous climate change. The US plan, however, leads to a 33% increase in emissions by 2012, maintaining a "business-as-usual" approach. The EU criticizes the voluntary nature of the US actions and the lack of a review until 2012. It notes that the US does not extend the successful cap-and-trade approach used for other pollutants to CO2 emissions. The EU plans to implement a cap-and-trade system by 2005, covering 46% of its CO2 emissions, and views this as a cost-effective measure to guarantee environmental results. While the EU acknowledges the Bush administration's effort as a step in the right direction, it emphasizes the need for mandatory monitoring and reporting to assess the plan's effectiveness. The EU remains committed to ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002 and hopes other major players, like Japan and Russia, will join its efforts. It will continue to examine the US proposals and engage in dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
