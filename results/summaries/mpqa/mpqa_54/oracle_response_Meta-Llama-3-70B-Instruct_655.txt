SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has pursued a foreign policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests over international cooperation. The deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) is a prime example, with the US persisting in its development despite international opposition. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. Furthermore, the US has adopted a stance of "attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it," thereby securing its status as the "sole superpower."

In the Sino-US plane collision event, the US claimed that only its spy plane was permitted to operate near Chinese airspace, while China had no right to protect its territory. The US also refused to apologize to China, instead threatening to "retaliate" against China using human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues.

The US has used multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism, as seen in its "war against terrorism," where it expects all countries to stand behind it and decides which countries are its enemies or friends based on their attitude towards the US. END OF SUMMARY.
