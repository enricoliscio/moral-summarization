Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the US foreign policy after the Cold War, focusing on Bush's approach. It mentions pragmatism and unilateralism as key strategies. 

Bush wanted to deploy the National Missile Defense (NMD) despite opposition, even from allies. He tried to get the international community to accept it, citing it as non-threatening but also saying the ABM Treaty was outdated. The US kept testing the NMD even after a UN resolution against it.

Then there's the Sino-US plane collision incident. The US didn't apologize initially but did after pressure. Once the crew was released, the US threatened retaliation. 

Bush also withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol and other treaties, only keeping those that benefit the US. After 9/11, the US framed the fight against terrorism as a global effort, pressuring other countries to support it. They even changed their stance on Pakistan, lifting sanctions and aiding them after 9/11.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main points: US as sole superpower, Bush's pragmatism and unilateralism, NMD deployment, handling of international treaties, the plane incident, and post-9/11 foreign policy. Make sure to connect each point clearly and concisely.

SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, with a foreign policy increasingly marked by pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. Bush prioritized deploying the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite opposition from the international community and allies. He argued the NMD posed no threat but also criticized the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty as outdated, leading to increased funding and testing of the system. The US continued testing despite a UN resolution opposing it.

In the Sino-US plane collision incident, the US initially refused to apologize, claiming its crew was detained, but eventually apologized under pressure. After releasing the crew, the US threatened retaliation, highlighting its pragmatic and unilateral approach. Bush also withdrew from international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, focusing only on treaties benefiting US security and economy.

Post-9/11, the US framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, pressuring countries to support its agenda. It softened its stance toward Pakistan, lifting sanctions and providing aid, despite previous tensions. Overall, Bush's foreign policy reflected a blend of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing US interests while leveraging international cooperation to advance its goals. END OF SUMMARY.
