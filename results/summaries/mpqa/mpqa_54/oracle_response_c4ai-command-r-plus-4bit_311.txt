SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States has become the sole superpower and its foreign policy has embraced pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. Bush has insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community and allies. He has used a mix of threats and incentives to persuade others to accept the NMD and revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), even suggesting the US would scrap the ABM. The US justifies the NMD as a means to attack and prevent attacks, securing its superpower status. The April 1st Sino-US plane collision exemplifies US hypocrisy, where US spy planes operate with impunity while China is denied the right to protect its borders. The US refused to apologize for the collision, which resulted in a Chinese plane crash and pilot fatality. Only due to China's firm stance and holding of US crew members was an apology eventually offered. However, upon their release, the US threatened retaliation against China on various issues. Bush has also adopted a pragmatic and unilateral approach to international treaties, disregarding the Kyoto Protocol and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and refusing to support the Biological Weapons Convention. The US selectively engages with treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that benefit its security, economy, and globalization agenda while rejecting restrictions on its freedom. Post-9/11, the international community condemned terrorism and supported the US-led "war on terror." Bush framed the war as a global effort, demanding nations choose sides. Yet, the US practices pragmatism with Pakistan, drawing it into the anti-terrorism fold despite previous sanctions.
