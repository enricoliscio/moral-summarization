SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has emerged as the world's sole superpower, with its foreign policy characterized by a blend of pragmatism and unilateralism. The Bush administration has pursued a unilateralist approach to foreign policy, as exemplified by its insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition. The US justifies the NMD as a means to maintain its superpower status, claiming it poses no threat to international security. Bush's administration has also adopted a pragmatic stance towards international treaties, often prioritizing US interests above global agreements. This was evident when Bush withdrew from the "Kyoto Protocol" and stalled the "Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." Post-9/11, the US launched a "war on terrorism," positioning itself as the world's "major force of anti-terrorism." Bush demanded that all nations align with the US or be branded as supporters of terrorism. While the US has employed multilateral diplomacy, it has simultaneously enhanced its unilateralism, as seen in its pragmatic treatment of Pakistan, a key ally in the fight against terrorism. The US has used a combination of threats and incentives to pursue its foreign policy goals, showcasing its commitment to unilateralism and pragmatism.
