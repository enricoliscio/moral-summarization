SUMMARY: The United States, as the world's sole superpower post-Cold War, has embraced pragmatism and unilateralism as the main tenets of its foreign policy under the Bush administration. This is exemplified by its insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition, and its unilateral actions in the Sino-US plane collision incident. Bush's administration has also shown disregard for international treaties, catering to the interests of US industries and prioritizing US security and economic globalization. The "war on terror" post-9/11 further showcases US unilateralism, as it leverages multilateral diplomacy to strengthen its own position, rewarding compliant countries like Pakistan with aid while threatening to retaliate against China over human rights and trade issues. The US approach to foreign policy is characterized by a self-serving agenda that leverages its superpower status to secure dominance and shape international relations on its terms.

END OF SUMMARY.
