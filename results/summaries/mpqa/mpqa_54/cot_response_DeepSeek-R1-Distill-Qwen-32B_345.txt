Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. It mentions the deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), opposition from the international community, including Canada, and the US's persistence despite that. There's also the Sino-US plane collision incident where the US refused to apologize and later retaliated. Additionally, the US withdrew from international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and their approach in the war on terrorism, especially with Pakistan.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Looking through the text, words like "unilateralism," "opposition," "coercion," "retaliation," "condemnation," "sanctions," "hostile," "oppression," and "exploitation" stand out as they carry moral judgments. These words highlight the US's actions as self-serving and disregarding international norms.

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these morally charged words. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, capturing the essence of the US's foreign policy under Bush, emphasizing their unilateral and pragmatic approach, the NMD deployment, the plane incident, withdrawal from treaties, and their stance in the war on terrorism. I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, showing the US as acting in self-interest without regard for international cooperation or norms.

**Summary:**
The article examines the United States' foreign policy under Bush, highlighting a pragmatic and unilateral approach. The US persisted in deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition, including from allies like Canada. This decision was framed as self-serving, disregarding global security concerns. The Sino-US plane collision incident exemplified this approach, with the US refusing to apologize and later threatening retaliation, showcasing coercion and a disregard for international norms. Additionally, the US withdrew from international treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing national interests over global cooperation. In the context of the war on terrorism, the US employed a dual strategy, using multilateral support to enhance unilateral actions, while exploiting pragmatic relations with countries like Pakistan. The article underscores the US's tendency to act in self-interest, often at the expense of international cooperation and norms, reflecting a pattern of exploitation and oppression in its foreign policy. **End of Summary.**
