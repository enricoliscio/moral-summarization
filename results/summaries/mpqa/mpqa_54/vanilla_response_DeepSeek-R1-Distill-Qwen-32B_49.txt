Okay, I need to summarize this article about U.S. foreign policy under Bush. Let me read through the key points.

The article starts by noting that after the Cold War, the U.S. became the sole superpower and its foreign policy became more pragmatic. Bush's main policies were unilateralism and pragmatism. He pushed for the National Missile Defense (NMD) despite opposition, even from allies like Canada. The U.S. tried to get the international community to accept NMD and revise the ABM Treaty, arguing it was outdated.

They increased funding and testing for NMD, even after the UN resolution supporting the ABM Treaty. The article mentions the plane collision incident with China, where the U.S. refused to apologize initially but later did after pressure, then threatened repercussions.

Bush also opposed international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, favoring only those that benefit U.S. interests. After 9/11, the U.S. framed the "war on terror" as a global effort, using it to strengthen its unilateral stance. They supported Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, reversing previous sanctions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Bush's pragmatism and unilateralism, NMD, opposition to international treaties, the plane incident, and the post-9/11 approach. Make sure to highlight the key policies and their implications.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the U.S. emerged as the sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism under Bush. Key initiatives included the deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite opposition from allies and the international community. Bush sought to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), arguing it was outdated, and accelerated NMD testing, even after a UN resolution supporting the treaty. The U.S. also opposed international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing its security and economic interests.  

In the 2001 Sino-U.S. plane collision incident, the U.S. initially refused to apologize for the crash, later doing so under pressure, but threatened repercussions afterward. Post-9/11, Bush framed the "war on terrorism" as a global effort, using multilateral support to justify unilateral actions. The U.S. reversed sanctions against Pakistan, a key ally in the fight against terrorism, highlighting its pragmatic approach to foreign policy.  

END OF SUMMARY.
