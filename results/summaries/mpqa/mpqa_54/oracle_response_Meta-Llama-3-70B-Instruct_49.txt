SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has pursued a policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests over international cooperation. Despite opposition from the international community, the US has persisted in deploying its National Missile Defense System (NMD), claiming it will not trigger an arms race. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. Furthermore, the US has adopted a stance of "either you are with us or you are with the terrorists," using multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism. In the Sino-US plane collision event, the US has taken a stance of "attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it," and has refused to apologize to China. The US has also used human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China. The Bush administration's diplomacy is characterized by a willingness to "scrap" international treaties and "use" other countries to further its own interests.
