SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has solidified its position as the world's sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly driven by pragmatism and unilateralism. The Bush administration has consistently pursued its own interests, often at the expense of international treaties and alliances. Bush has prioritized the development of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community, including US allies. The US justifies this by claiming it poses no threat to international security and that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is a relic of the Cold War. The US has also withdrawn from the "Kyoto Protocol" and stalled the "Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty," prioritizing its own economic and security interests above global commitments. The "war on terror" further exemplifies US unilateralism, as Bush declared that any nation not with them is with the terrorists. The US expects all countries to support its counter-terrorism efforts and determines enemies and friends based on their cooperation. This is a form of multilateral diplomacy in the service of unilateralism. Notably, the US has pragmatically improved relations with Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, despite previous sanctions. The US approach to diplomacy is characterized by unilateralism masked by pragmatic justifications, always prioritizing its own interests above international commitments and alliances. 

END OF SUMMARY.
