SUMMARY: The United States' foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic and unilateral since the end of the Cold War, with the Bush administration's diplomacy characterized by the alternate use and complementary nature of these two approaches. Bush has pursued a unilateralist stance on issues such as the deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community and even US allies. The US justifies this by claiming it does not pose a threat to international security and that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is a relic of the Cold War. The US also showcases unilateralism in its treatment of China, as seen in the plane collision incident, and its withdrawal from international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Post-9/11, the US launched a "war on terrorism," positioning itself as a leader in the fight against terrorism and demanding that all nations support its efforts or be branded as enemies. This is a form of multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. However, the US also practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, offering aid and support despite previous sanctions. The US' foreign policy is driven by its immediate interests and a desire for unrestricted freedom, showcasing a complex interplay between unilateralism and pragmatism. END OF SUMMARY.
