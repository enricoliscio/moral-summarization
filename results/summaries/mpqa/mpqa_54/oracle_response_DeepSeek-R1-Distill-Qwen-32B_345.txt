Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and end with specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. It mentions the deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD), opposition from the international community, Bush's persistence despite that, and the use of carrot-and-stick tactics. The Sino-US plane collision is used as an example of the US's approach, where they refused to apologize initially but later did so under pressure. The article also talks about the US stance on international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, showing their reluctance to enforce or sign them. Post-9/11, the US's war on terrorism is highlighted, with Bush's statements about being either with them or the terrorists, and the shifting stance towards Pakistan.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided and incorporate them into the summary. Words like deploying, plan, persuade, revise, flashing, trigger, scrap, persist, attacking, collision, permitted, spy, protect, crashed, perished, apologize, detained, retaliate, enforce, freeze, refuse, sign, ratify, implement, revision, attacks, condemned, sympathy, support, terrorism, with, continues, harbor, event.

I'll structure the summary to cover the main points: US as a sole superpower, Bush's policies, NMD deployment, international opposition, Bush's persistence, the plane collision incident, refusal to apologize, threats, international treaties stance, post-9/11 terrorism approach, and the shift in policy towards Pakistan.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well, uses the morally charged words appropriately, and stays within the word limit. I'll start by outlining each section briefly, then condense it using the key terms.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, adopting a pragmatic and unilateral foreign policy under Bush. The administration persisted in deploying the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite international opposition, even after the UN resolution. The plan aimed to attack others while preventing attacks on itself, scraping the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Sino-US plane collision event highlighted this approach: the US refused to apologize for the crash, claiming the Chinese pilot perished due to their actions, and later retaliated with threats. Bush also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and froze the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing US interests. Post-9/11, the US declared a global war on terrorism, demanding global support and labeling those not with them as enemies. Despite this, the US shifted its stance towards Pakistan, offering aid after initially imposing sanctions. The administration's unilateralism and pragmatism dominated its foreign policy, often disregarding international norms. END OF SUMMARY.
