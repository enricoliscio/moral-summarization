SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a foreign policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests over international cooperation. Despite opposition, the US has pushed forward with its National Missile Defense System, refusing to compromise on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Sino-US plane collision incident highlights the US's double standard, where it expects other countries to respect its actions while not reciprocating the same courtesy. The US has also selectively chosen which international treaties to enforce, rejecting those that don't benefit its economy or security. In the war on terrorism, the US expects other countries to stand behind it, labeling those who don't as "hostile regimes." The US's treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, raises questions about its long-term commitment to responsible behavior. Overall, the US's foreign policy is marked by a self-serving approach, prioritizing its own power and interests over global cooperation and diplomacy.
