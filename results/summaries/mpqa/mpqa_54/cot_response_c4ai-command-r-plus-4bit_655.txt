SUMMARY:
The article discusses the United States' foreign policy approach under the Bush administration, characterized by a combination of unilateralism and pragmatism. The US has pursued its interests through a selective approach to international treaties and alliances, prioritizing those that benefit its security, economy, and globalization agenda while disregarding or withdrawing from those that restrict its freedom. This has been evident in Bush's insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community and even US allies. The US has also used a combination of threats, sanctions, and selective support to assert its power, as seen in its treatment of countries like Pakistan and China. Following the September 11 attacks, the US positioned itself as the "major force of anti-terrorism," demanding that all nations stand behind it in the war on terror and designating enemies and friends based on their compliance. Bush's administration has been criticized for its unilateral approach to international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as well as its refusal to support the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention. The US has prioritized its immediate interests and the interests of its domestic backers, often at the expense of its allies and the international community. The article concludes by questioning the sustainability of the US's responsible treatment of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.
