Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. It talks about the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. The key points are the NMD deployment, opposition from allies, the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Biological Weapons Convention. Also, the plane collision incident with China and the post-9/11 approach to terrorism.

I should highlight how the US prioritizes its interests, disregarding international agreements and consensus. The moral critique is that the US is acting selfishly, undermining global cooperation. I need to make sure the summary captures this critique without being too lengthy, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me structure it: start with the US as a sole superpower, mention Bush's policies, NMD, the collision incident, treaties, and the terrorism stance. Conclude with the moral implications of unilateralism. Make sure to include the criticism from the international community and the negative impact on global security and cooperation.

Okay, time to draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all main points with the moral angle intact.

SUMMARY:  
The United States, as the world's sole superpower, has pursued a foreign policy dominated by pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. This approach has led to actions such as the deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite global opposition, and the withdrawal from international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the Biological Weapons Convention. The U.S. has prioritized its security and economic interests, often disregarding international consensus and agreements.  

The moral framing highlights the U.S.'s disregard for global cooperation and its tendency to act unilaterally, even when it undermines international stability. For instance, in the Sino-U.S. plane collision incident, the U.S. refused to apologize and later threatened retaliation, showcasing its self-centered approach. Post-9/11, the U.S. framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, but its treatment of allies like Pakistan revealed its pragmatic and self-serving diplomacy. The article criticizes the U.S. for using multilateral rhetoric to justify unilateral actions, undermining global security and cooperation.  

END OF SUMMARY.
