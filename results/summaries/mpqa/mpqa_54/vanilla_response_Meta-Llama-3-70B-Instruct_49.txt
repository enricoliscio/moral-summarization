SUMMARY:

The article discusses the United States' foreign policy under the Bush administration, characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism. The US has pursued its own interests, disregarding international opposition, as seen in its development of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite opposition from the international community and Russia. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. The article cites the Sino-US plane collision event as an example of the US' alternate application of pragmatism and unilateralism, where the US refused to apologize to China and instead threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China. The US has also used its "war against terrorism" to further its own interests, expecting other countries to stand behind it and deciding which countries are its enemies or friends based on their attitude towards the US.
