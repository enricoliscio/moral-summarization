SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a pragmatic and unilateral approach to foreign policy, prioritizing its own interests and security above international agreements and collaborations. The deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) is a prime example, with the US refusing to apologize for the Sino-US plane collision and instead blaming China. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Biological Weapons Convention, and has asked for revisions to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

The US has used its power to persuade other countries to accept its plans, often using carrots and sticks to get its way. In the war against terrorism, the US has positioned itself as the sole leader, expecting other countries to follow its lead and condemning those who do not comply.

The US has persisted in its unilateral approach, often attacking other countries' sovereignty and security while protecting its own. This has led to international condemnation and criticism, with the US being seen as a bully on the world stage. END OF SUMMARY.
