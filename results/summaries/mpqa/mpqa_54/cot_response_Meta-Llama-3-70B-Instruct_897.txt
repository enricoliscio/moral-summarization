SUMMARY:
The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a policy of unilateralism and pragmatism, prioritizing its own interests and security above international cooperation. Despite opposition from the international community, the US has pushed forward with its National Missile Defense System, claiming it does not pose a threat to global security. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. The Bush administration has used a carrot-and-stick approach to persuade other countries to accept its policies, often threatening to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against those who do not comply. The US has positioned itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," expecting other countries to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
