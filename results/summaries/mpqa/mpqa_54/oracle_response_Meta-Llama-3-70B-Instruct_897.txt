SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has been pursuing a foreign policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests over international cooperation. Despite opposition from the international community, the US has persisted in deploying its National Missile Defense System (NMD), claiming it won't trigger an arms race. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. Moreover, the Bush administration has adopted a stance of "attacking other countries and preventing other countries from attacking it," thereby securing its status as the "sole superpower."

In the Sino-US plane collision event, the US refused to apologize and instead claimed the Chinese side was responsible. The US has also been using its power to "retaliate" against countries that don't follow its orders, as seen in its treatment of Pakistan. The international community has condemned the US's actions, but the US continues to prioritize its own interests over global cooperation.

END OF SUMMARY.
