SUMMARY:
The United States' foreign policy has been characterized by unilateralism and pragmatism, with a clear focus on prioritizing their own interests above all else. This was exemplified by President Bush's insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition. The US justified this decision by claiming that it would not pose a threat to international security and that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was a relic of the Cold War. When faced with the Sino-US plane collision incident, the US refused to take responsibility and even threatened China with retaliation over human rights and trade issues. Bush's administration has also shown a disregard for international treaties, refusing to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and stalling on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After the September 11 attacks, the US received global support and sympathy as it launched its "war against terrorism." Bush stressed that any nation that did not stand with the US was considered hostile. The US has shown pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, by providing aid despite previous sanctions. However, the US' commitment to Pakistan remains uncertain. The country's foreign policy decisions are driven by a unilateralist and pragmatic approach, often at the expense of international cooperation and moral responsibility.
