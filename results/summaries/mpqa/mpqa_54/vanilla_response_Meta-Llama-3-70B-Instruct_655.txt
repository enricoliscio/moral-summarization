SUMMARY:

The article discusses the United States' foreign policy under the Bush administration, characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism. Despite international opposition, the US has pushed forward with its National Missile Defense System (NMD) and has been trying to persuade other countries to accept it. The US has also been selective in its adherence to international treaties, opting out of the Kyoto Protocol and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and has been accused of using human rights and trade issues to "retaliate" against countries that don't comply with its demands. The article also highlights the US' treatment of Pakistan, which has received aid and support in the fight against terrorism despite previously being sanctioned. The US' approach to foreign policy is seen as a way to maintain its status as the sole superpower.
