SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States, as the world's sole superpower, has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy. President Bush has doubled down on this approach, as seen in his insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition. Bush's administration has also been characterized by the alternate use and complementarity of pragmatism and unilateralism, as demonstrated in the Sino-US plane collision incident, where the US claimed the right to spy while denying China the right to protect its borders. Bush's administration has taken a pragmatic and unilateral approach to international treaties, refusing to enforce or ratify those that do not serve US interests, such as the "Kyoto Protocol" and the "Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." Following the September 11 attacks, the US launched a "war against terrorism," positioning itself as a leader in the fight against terrorism and demanding that other countries fall in line. However, the US has also practiced pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, by offering aid and support despite previous sanctions. Bush's administration has been willing to compromise and use diplomacy when it serves their interests while also being unilateral and uncompromising when it comes to treaties and actions that don't align with their agenda.
END OF SUMMARY.
