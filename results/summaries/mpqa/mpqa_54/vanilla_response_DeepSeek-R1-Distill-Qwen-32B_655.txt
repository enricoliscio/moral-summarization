Okay, I need to summarize this article about U.S. foreign policy under Bush. Let me read through it first.

The article talks about how after the Cold War, the U.S. became the sole superpower and started using more pragmatic and unilateral policies. Bush's approach combines these two, focusing on the National Missile Defense (NMD) system despite opposition. They tested it multiple times, even after the UN resolution. It also mentions the spy plane incident with China, where the U.S. didn't apologize at first but then did after pressure, but later threatened repercussions.

Additionally, the U.S. withdrew from international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, only wanting treaties that benefit them. Post-9/11, they framed the fight against terrorism as a global war, using it to strengthen their unilateral stance, while also pragmatically allying with Pakistan.

I should condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main points: pragmatism, unilateralism, NMD, international opposition, the spy plane incident, treaty withdrawals, and the post-9/11 approach.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the U.S. emerged as the sole superpower, adopting pragmatic and unilateral foreign policies under Bush. Key actions included pursuing the National Missile Defense (NMD) system despite global opposition, testing it repeatedly even after UN resolutions. The U.S. also refused to enforce international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing its security and economic interests. The spy plane incident with China highlighted the U.S.'s refusal to apologize initially, only doing so under pressure, then threatening repercussions. Post-9/11, the U.S. framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, using multilateral support to bolster unilateral actions. It pragmatically allied with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism. Overall, Bush's diplomacy combined pragmatism and unilateralism to maintain U.S. dominance.  
END OF SUMMARY.
