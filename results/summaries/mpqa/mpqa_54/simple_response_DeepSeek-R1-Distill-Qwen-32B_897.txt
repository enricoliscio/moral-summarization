Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. It mentions the NMD, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, showing how the US acts unilaterally. The Sino-US plane collision is a key example of this. Also, the war on terrorism is discussed, highlighting how the US uses multilateral support but still acts unilaterally. I should make sure to include these points, emphasizing the moral implications of the US's actions, like disregarding international norms and the impact on global cooperation. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to cover the main policies and their consequences, maintaining the critical tone from the original text.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly defined by pragmatism and unilateralism under Bush's administration. The Bush administration pursued the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite global opposition, arguing it was necessary for US security and dismissing the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as outdated. The US also refused to ratify or implement international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing its economic and security interests over global cooperation.  

The Sino-US plane collision incident exemplified this approach: the US rejected apologizing for the crash, initially refusing to acknowledge responsibility, and later threatened retaliation after apologizing under pressure. The US's "war on terrorism" further highlighted its unilateral stance, framing the conflict as a global effort while asserting its right to determine friends and foes based on others' compliance. Even with allies like Pakistan, the US shifted its stance pragmatically, offering aid only when it served its interests.  

The article critiques the US's disregard for international norms, emphasizing its self-interest and willingness to bypass global agreements, raising moral concerns about its impact on international cooperation and security.  
END OF SUMMARY.
