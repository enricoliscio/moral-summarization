Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. 

I notice the article mentions the National Missile Defense System (NMD) and how the US is pushing it despite international opposition. There's also the Kyoto Protocol and other treaties where the US isn't complying. The moral angle here is the US prioritizing its own interests over global cooperation, which could be seen as self-serving and ignoring international norms.

The Sino-US plane collision is another key point. The US refused to apologize initially and later threatened retaliation, showing a double standard. This highlights the US's self-interest and disregard for other nations' sovereignty.

In the context of the "war on terrorism," the US is using multilateral support but still acting unilaterally, which the article criticizes. The example of Pakistan shows inconsistency in US policy, depending on their alignment with US interests.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: US as a sole superpower, pragmatism and unilateralism, NMD, treaties like Kyoto, the plane incident, and the terrorism context. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the moral critique about self-interest and disregard for international obligations.

I'll structure the summary to first state the US's role as a superpower, then outline the policies and actions, and finally address the moral implications of these actions. Making sure to highlight how the US prioritizes its interests over global cooperation and the negative perception from the international community.

SUMMARY:  
The United States, as the sole superpower post-Cold War, has pursued a foreign policy rooted in pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. This approach is evident in its insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite global opposition, and its refusal to adhere to international treaties like the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) and the Kyoto Protocol. The U.S. has also used threats, such as in the Sino-U.S. plane collision incident, to prioritize its interests over international norms. Its "war on terrorism" further highlights this dual strategy, using multilateral support to justify unilateral actions, while selectively engaging with countries like Pakistan based on alignment with U.S. goals. The article critiques the U.S. for prioritizing self-interest over global cooperation, disregarding international obligations, and undermining multilateralism. END OF SUMMARY.
