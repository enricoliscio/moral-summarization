Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that are morally framed. That's step one. The user mentioned words like "unilateralism," "pragmatism," "opposed," "coercion," etc. I need to make sure I capture all those.

Looking at the article, it talks about the US being the sole superpower after the Cold War and using pragmatism and unilateralism in foreign policy. They pushed the NMD despite opposition, which is morally framed as disregarding international norms. The plane collision incident shows the US refusing to apologize and later threatening retaliation, which are moral issues like arrogance and coercion.

Then, the US didn't enforce the Kyoto Protocol and froze other treaties, which is morally framed as ignoring global responsibilities. Post-9/11, the US framed the fight against terrorism as a global war, pressuring other countries to align with them, which is another moral stance. Pakistan's treatment before and after 9/11 shows inconsistency in US policy, highlighting moral hypocrisy.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating the US's foreign policy approach, mention the NMD and the opposition, the plane incident, the treaties, and the post-9/11 actions. I'll ensure each point reflects the moral framing without exceeding 200 words.

I should structure it to show the US's unilateral actions, their disregard for international agreements, and the inconsistency in their approach to global issues. Highlighting their use of coercion and threats will emphasize the moral aspects. I need to make sure the summary flows logically, covering each key point from the article while keeping it concise.

The article highlights the United States' foreign policy under Bush, characterized by unilateralism and pragmatism, often disregarding international norms. The U.S. pushed for the National Missile Defense (NMD) despite global opposition, using coercion to justify its actions. In the Sino-U.S. plane collision incident, the U.S. refused to apologize and later threatened retaliation, showcasing its arrogance. The U.S. also ignored global responsibilities by rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and freezing treaties like the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Post-9/11, the U.S. framed the "war on terrorism" as a global effort, pressuring nations to align with its interests, while inconsistently treating allies like Pakistan. These actions reflect a moral hypocrisy, prioritizing U.S. dominance over international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
