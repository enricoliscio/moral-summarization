Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US foreign policy under Bush after the Cold War, emphasizing pragmatism and unilateralism. It mentions the deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD) despite international opposition, including from allies. The US tried to persuade others by胡萝卜大棒, claiming the NMD wouldn't threaten security but also suggesting the ABM Treaty was outdated.

There's the incident with the Chinese plane collision, where the US refused to apologize initially but did so under pressure. Later, they threatened repercussions. The article also discusses Bush's stance on international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, refusing to enforce or ratify them. After 9/11, the US framed the war on terror as a global effort, using multilateralism to support unilateral actions, especially with Pakistan, reversing previous sanctions.

I should structure the summary to cover these points concisely, focusing on Bush's policies, the NMD, handling of international treaties, and the post-9/11 approach. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll mention each key point briefly.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly emphasizing pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. Key aspects include the deployment of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite opposition from the international community and US allies. Bush argued the NMD would enhance US security and reduce the threat of an arms race, while also asserting the outdated nature of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. The US persisted in testing the NMD even after UN resolutions opposing it.  

The Sino-US plane collision incident exemplified Bush's dual approach: the US initially refused to apologize for the crash but eventually did so under pressure from China. Subsequently, US officials threatened retaliation, highlighting the pragmatic and unilateral nature of US diplomacy.  

Bush also rejected international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing US interests over global cooperation. Post-9/11, the US framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, using multilateral support to justify unilateral actions. This approach was evident in its treatment of Pakistan, reversing previous sanctions to secure its cooperation in the anti-terrorism campaign.  

Overall, Bush's foreign policy reflected a blend of pragmatism and unilateralism, aiming to maintain US dominance while addressing immediate interests.  
END OF SUMMARY.
