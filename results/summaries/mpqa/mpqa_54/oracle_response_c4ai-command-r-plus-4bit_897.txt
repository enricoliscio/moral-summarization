SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States, as the world's sole superpower, has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy. The Bush administration has been characterized by the alternating and complementary use of these two approaches. One notable example is the deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition. Bush attempted to persuade the international community and Russia to accept the NMD, even suggesting a revision to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The US also demonstrated its unilateralism in the Sino-US plane collision incident, where it refused to take responsibility and instead, threatened China with "retaliation." Bush's administration has also adopted a pragmatic and unilateral stance towards international treaties, often refusing to sign, ratify, or comply with those that do not serve US interests. After the September 11 attacks, the US launched a "war against terrorism," positioning itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism." Bush's ultimatum, "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists," exemplified the US's unilateral approach to international relations. The US expects all countries to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and determines its enemies and friends based on their attitude towards the US. However, the US has also demonstrated pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism. The US's shifting alliances and unilateral actions highlight its self-serving foreign policy agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
