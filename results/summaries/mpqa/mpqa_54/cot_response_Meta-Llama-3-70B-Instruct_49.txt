SUMMARY:
The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a policy of unilateralism and pragmatism, prioritizing its own immediate interests and security over international cooperation and treaties. This approach has led to controversy, such as the development of the National Missile Defense System, which has been met with opposition from the international community. The US has also been criticized for its response to the Sino-US plane collision, where it refused to apologize and instead threatened to retaliate against China. Furthermore, the US has refused to enforce international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and has instead prioritized its own economic and security interests. This approach has been met with condemnation from the international community, and has raised concerns about the US's role as a "sole superpower" and its impact on global security and cooperation.
