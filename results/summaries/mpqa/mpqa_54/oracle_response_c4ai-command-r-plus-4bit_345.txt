SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States, the world's sole superpower, has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy. President Bush has been adamant about deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community, including US allies. Bush has used a mix of persuasion and threats to gain acceptance for the NMD and revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM). The US justifies the NMD as a means to maintain its superpower status and protect itself from attacks. The US has also demonstrated unilateralism and pragmatism in its dealings with China and Pakistan, as well as its withdrawal from international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After the September 11 attacks, the US launched a "war on terrorism," demanding that all nations side with it or be considered enemies. The US threatens to retaliate against countries that do not comply with its demands, using issues like human rights and trade as leverage. Bush's administration is willing to abandon or ignore international treaties and organizations that do not serve US interests, demonstrating a clear disregard for multilateral diplomacy and a commitment to unilateralism. END OF SUMMARY.
