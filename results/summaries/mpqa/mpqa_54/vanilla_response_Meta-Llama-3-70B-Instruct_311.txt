SUMMARY:

The article discusses the foreign policy of the United States under the Bush administration, characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism. Despite international opposition, the US has pursued its National Missile Defense System (NMD) and sought to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM). The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. The article criticizes the US for its selective approach to international treaties, only supporting those that benefit its security and economy. The US has also used its "war on terrorism" to justify its unilateral actions, expecting other countries to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism. The article highlights the US's pragmatic treatment of Pakistan, which has received aid and support despite previously being sanctioned. Overall, the US has prioritized its own interests and security over international cooperation and diplomacy.
