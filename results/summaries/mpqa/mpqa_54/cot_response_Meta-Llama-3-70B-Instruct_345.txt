SUMMARY:
The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a unilateralist and pragmatic approach to foreign policy, prioritizing its own interests and security above all else. The development of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) is a prime example, with the US pushing ahead despite international opposition. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has "frozen" the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, demonstrating its disregard for international treaties that restrict its freedom. In its "war against terrorism," the US expects other countries to stand behind it, deciding who is an enemy or friend based on their attitude towards the US. Meanwhile, the US has adopted a pragmatic approach to Pakistan, providing aid and support despite its previous sanctions. The US's actions have been met with international condemnation, and its unilateralism has sparked concerns about its role as a "sole superpower." END OF SUMMARY.
