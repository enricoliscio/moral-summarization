Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. 

First, I need to understand the key points. The article talks about the US becoming the sole superpower after the Cold War, Bush's policies, the NMD deployment, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It also mentions the Sino-US plane collision and the war on terrorism.

I should identify the moral framing here. The author seems critical of US actions, highlighting how the US prioritizes its interests over international cooperation. Words like "unilateralism," "ignoring international opposition," and "undermining global efforts" indicate a negative moral stance.

Next, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the US as the sole superpower and Bush's policies. Then mention the NMD and the opposition. Include examples like the Kyoto Protocol and treaties to show disregard for international agreements. Highlight the plane collision incident as an example of US behavior. Then touch on the war on terrorism and how it's used to justify unilateral actions, mentioning Pakistan's case. Conclude by summarizing the US's approach as self-interest over global cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and each point is clear. Also, maintain the critical tone to preserve the moral framing. Let me check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly driven by pragmatism and unilateralism. Under Bush, the U.S. pursued the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, disregarding international opposition, including from allies like Canada. The U.S. argued the NMD would not threaten global security but insisted on revising or discarding the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), despite global criticism.  

The U.S. also reneged on international commitments, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing national interests over global cooperation. The Sino-U.S. plane collision incident exemplified this approach: the U.S. refused to apologize for the crash, only doing so under pressure, and later threatened retaliation.  

After 9/11, the U.S. framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, demanding international support while practicing pragmatism, such as allying with Pakistan despite prior tensions. The U.S. consistently prioritized its status as a sole superpower, often undermining multilateral agreements and international norms to secure its interests.  

END OF SUMMARY.
