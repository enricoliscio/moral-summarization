SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has pursued a foreign policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests and security above international cooperation and treaties. Despite opposition from the international community, the US has pushed forward with its National Missile Defense System, claiming it does not pose a threat to global security. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. Furthermore, the US has adopted a "with us or against us" approach in its war on terrorism, expecting all countries to stand behind it and deciding which countries are its enemies or friends based on their attitude towards the US. The US has even changed its stance towards Pakistan, providing aid and drawing it to its side after declaring a war on terrorism. This approach has been criticized for being self-serving and undermining international cooperation.
