SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has adopted a pragmatic and unilateral approach to foreign policy, prioritizing its own interests and security above international cooperation and treaties. This is evident in its pursuit of the National Missile Defense System, despite opposition from the international community, and its refusal to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and other international treaties. The US has also demonstrated a double standard in its diplomacy, as seen in the Sino-US plane collision event, where it refused to apologize to China and instead threatened retaliation. The Bush administration's "war on terrorism‚Äù has been used to justify its unilateral actions and to coerce other countries into supporting its agenda. The US has also practiced pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, providing aid and support after declaring a war against terrorism. Overall, the US has prioritized its own power and interests, disregarding international norms and cooperation.

END OF SUMMARY.
