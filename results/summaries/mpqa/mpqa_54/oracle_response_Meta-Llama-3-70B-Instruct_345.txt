SUMMARY:

The United States, under the Bush administration, has been pursuing a policy of pragmatism and unilateralism, prioritizing its own interests over international cooperation. Despite opposition from the international community, the US has persisted in deploying its National Missile Defense System (NMD), claiming it won't trigger an arms race. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Biological Weapons Convention, and has instead asked for revisions that benefit its own security and economy.

In the Sino-US plane collision event, the US has taken a hypocritical stance, claiming the right to spy on other countries while denying them the right to protect their own territories. The US has also used its power to coerce other countries into supporting its "war against terrorism," threatening those who don't comply.

Throughout its foreign policy, the US has adopted a "might is right" approach, using its power to attack and intimidate other countries, while claiming to be a champion of anti-terrorism. This approach has been met with international condemnation and has led to a decline in global cooperation and trust.

END OF SUMMARY.
