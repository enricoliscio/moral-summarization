SUMMARY:
The United States' foreign policy has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism since the end of the Cold War, with the Bush administration alternating between these "two-isms" to pursue its interests. The deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition and the insistence on revising the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty illustrate the US desire to secure its superpower status. The plane collision incident with China further showcases the US' double standards and unilateralism, where the US refused to take responsibility and even threatened China with sanctions. Bush's administration has also shown little regard for international treaties, catering to domestic interests and selectively engaging with treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that benefit US security and economy. After the September 11 attacks, the US positioned itself as the "major force of anti-terrorism," demanding global support and dictating the terms of engagement. While the US has shown pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, its commitment to responsible engagement remains uncertain. The article condemns the US' unilateralism and pragmatism, portraying it as a self-serving superpower that disregards international norms and treats other nations with hostility when they do not align with its interests.
