SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower, embracing pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy under the Bush administration. Bush pursued the deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition, to maintain its superpower status. The US applied "two-isms" in the Sino-US plane collision event, asserting dominance and evading responsibility. Bush's pragmatism and unilateralism extend to international treaties, as seen in the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the stalling of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Post-9/11, the US positioned itself as a leader in the "war on terror," demanding global support and dictating relationships. The US shifted its stance on Pakistan, offering aid, but its long-term commitment is uncertain. Bush's foreign policy emphasizes US interests, power projection, and a unilateral approach to global affairs. 

END OF SUMMARY.
