SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has emerged as the world's sole superpower, with its foreign policy characterized by a mix of pragmatism and unilateralism. President Bush has pursued a primarily unilateralist and pragmatic approach, as seen in his insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition. The NMD aims to ensure the US's status as the sole superpower by enabling it to attack other countries while protecting itself from retaliation. The US's stance in the Sino-US plane collision incident exemplifies this, where it refused to acknowledge responsibility and demanded the release of its crew members. Bush's administration has also taken a pragmatic and unilateralist stance towards international treaties, often prioritizing immediate US interests above global agreements. They have withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, stalled the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and rejected the Biological Weapons Convention. The US expects the world to unite behind it in the fight against terrorism, threatening to label any nation that doesn't support it as an enemy. This mix of pragmatism and unilateralism seeks to strengthen US power and influence globally.

END OF SUMMARY.
