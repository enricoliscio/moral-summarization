SUMMARY: The United States' foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic and unilateralist since the end of the Cold War, with the Bush administration pursuing its own interests above all else. Bush has insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition, and has threatened to scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) if necessary. This is part of the US's strategy to secure its status as the sole superpower, able to attack other countries while preventing attacks on itself. The US has also demonstrated its unilateralism in the Sino-US plane collision incident, where it refused to take responsibility and instead threatened China with "retaliation." Bush's administration has also adopted a pragmatic and unilateralist position towards international treaties, refusing to enforce or ratifying those that do not benefit US security and economic interests. After the September 11 attacks, the US launched a "war on terrorism," demanding that all countries stand behind it and declaring any nation that continues to harbor terrorism as an enemy. However, the US has also demonstrated pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism. Bush's administration's diplomacy is characterized by the alternating use of unilateralism and pragmatism to pursue its own interests and enhance its power on the global stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
