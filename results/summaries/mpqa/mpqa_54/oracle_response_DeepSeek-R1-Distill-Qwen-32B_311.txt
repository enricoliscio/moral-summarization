Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. The key events include the deployment of NMD, the Sino-US plane collision, and the US stance on international treaties like Kyoto and CTBT.

I notice the author uses specific morally charged words like "deploying," "plan," "persuade," "revise," and "attack." I should include these in the summary to maintain the moral tone. The article also discusses how the US handles international relations, especially after 9/11, using the war on terrorism as a tool for unilateral actions.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the main policies and events, using the specified moral words. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points: NMD deployment, the plane collision incident, refusal to enforce international treaties, and the approach to terrorism. I'll make sure each point reflects the moral framing used by the author.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the US as a sole superpower, moving through specific policies and events, and ending with the implications of their foreign policy stance. I'll avoid adding my own interpretations and stick to the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States, as the sole superpower, has embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy. Bush administration diplomacy alternates between these two approaches, as seen in its insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense (NMD) system despite global opposition. The U.S. has persisted in testing the NMD, even after the UN General Assembly resolution to uphold the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Sino-US plane collision incident exemplifies this dual approach: the U.S. refused to apologize for the crash, claiming its spy plane's actions were permissible, and only apologized under pressure. Afterward, it threatened retaliation using issues like human rights and trade.  

The U.S. has also adopted a pragmatic stance on international treaties, refusing to enforce the Kyoto Protocol or implement the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, prioritizing its security and economic interests. Post-9/11, the U.S. framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, demanding international support while practicing pragmatism with allies like Pakistan, lifting sanctions to secure its cooperation. The author highlights the moral implications of these actions, emphasizing the U.S.'s unilateralism and its disregard for international norms and agreements. END OF SUMMARY.
