SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower, with pragmatism and unilateralism becoming the defining characteristics of the Bush administration's foreign policy. The development of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) exemplifies this approach, as Bush sought to secure US dominance while disregarding international opposition and treaties. The Sino-US plane collision incident further illustrates the US's self-serving logic and unilateralism. Bush's administration also demonstrated pragmatism and unilateralism in its approach to international treaties, catering to domestic interests and selectively engaging with treaties and nations that serve US security and economic interests. After the September 11 attacks, the US positioned itself as a leader in the global war on terrorism, demanding allegiance from other nations while threatening to label non-compliant nations as enemies. The US's treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, showcases its pragmatic approach, with aid and support contingent on alignment with US interests. Bush's foreign policy ultimately prioritizes US dominance and self-interest above all else.
END OF SUMMARY.
