SUMMARY:

The article discusses the foreign policy of the United States under President Bush, characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism. Despite international opposition, Bush has pushed forward with the National Missile Defense System (NMD) and has been trying to persuade the international community to accept it. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. The article cites the Sino-US plane collision event as an example of the US's alternate application of pragmatism and unilateralism, where the US refused to apologize to China and instead threatened to retaliate. The US has also adopted a selective approach to international treaties, only supporting those that benefit its security and economy. The article concludes that the US views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism" and wants all countries to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism, using multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism.
