SUMMARY:

The article critiques the United States' foreign policy under the Bush administration, accusing it of pragmatism and unilateralism. The US has disregarded international opposition to its National Missile Defense System and has pressured other countries to accept it. The article argues that the US is more concerned with maintaining its status as the sole superpower than with international security. The US has also been inconsistent in its diplomacy, as seen in the Sino-US plane collision event, where it refused to apologize and instead threatened to retaliate against China. Furthermore, the US has ignored international treaties that do not benefit its interests, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The article concludes that the US is using its power to dictate its terms to other countries, disregarding international cooperation and security.

END OF SUMMARY.
