Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. The article talks about US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. The user also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It discusses the US as the sole superpower, Bush's policies, NMD deployment, opposition from allies, the Kyoto Protocol, CTBT, Biological Weapons Convention, and the September 11 attacks leading to the war on terrorism. The author uses words like "deploying," "plan," "went," etc., which have moral connotations.

I should structure the summary to highlight the US's unilateral actions, their impact on international relations, and the moral implications. I need to make sure to include as many of the listed words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by outlining the key events and policies, then weave in the moral terms. For example, mentioning the deployment of NMD despite opposition, the refusal to enforce international treaties, the collision incident, and the use of threats against China. Then, touch on the war on terrorism and how it's framed as a global effort but with unilateral actions.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, showing the US's pragmatic and unilateral approach, the reactions from the international community, and the moral dilemmas presented. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence incorporates the moral terms where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, adopting a pragmatic and unilateral foreign policy under Bush. The administration pushed to deploy the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite global opposition, even after the UN called for maintaining the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM). The US insisted on revising the treaty, claiming it was outdated, and persisted in testing the NMD, aiming to attack others while preventing attacks on itself. The Sino-US plane collision incident highlighted this dual approach: the US refused to apologize for the crash, instead detaining Chinese pilots and later threatening retaliation. Bush also adopted a pragmatic stance on international treaties, refusing to enforce the Kyoto Protocol or implement the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Biological Weapons Convention, prioritizing US interests. After 9/11, the US framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, demanding allies' support while using multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism. It rewarded Pakistan with aid after the attacks, despite prior sanctions. The US's actions, including its refusal to apologize and its threats, underscore its pragmatic and unilateral approach, often at the expense of international cooperation and norms. END OF SUMMARY.
