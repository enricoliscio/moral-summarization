SUMMARY:
The United States, as the world's sole superpower, has adopted a pragmatic and unilateral approach to its foreign policy under the Bush administration. Despite international opposition, the US has insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System, claiming it does not pose a threat to international security. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has objected to the Biological Weapons Convention, demonstrating its disregard for international treaties that restrict its freedom. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the US has launched a "war against terrorism," expecting all countries to stand behind it and deciding which nations are its enemies or friends based on their attitude towards it. The US has even provided aid to Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, despite previously imposing sanctions on it. END OF SUMMARY.
