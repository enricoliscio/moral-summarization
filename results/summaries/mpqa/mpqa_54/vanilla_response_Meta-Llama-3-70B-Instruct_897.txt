SUMMARY:

The article discusses the foreign policy of the Bush administration, which is characterized by pragmatism and unilateralism. Despite international opposition, the US has pursued its National Missile Defense System (NMD) and has been trying to persuade other countries to accept it. The US has also been selective in its adherence to international treaties, choosing to ignore or revise those that do not benefit its security and economy. The article cites examples such as the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol and its refusal to support the Biological Weapons Convention. The US has also been using its "war on terrorism" to justify its unilateral actions and to pressure other countries to follow its lead. The article suggests that the US is using its power to pursue its own interests, often at the expense of other countries and international cooperation.
