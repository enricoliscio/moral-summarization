SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower, embracing pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy under the Bush administration. The development of the National Missile Defense System (NMD) exemplified this approach, with Bush prioritizing US interests despite international opposition. The Sino-US plane collision incident further illustrated the application of these principles, with the US initially refusing to apologize and later shifting its stance upon the release of its crew. Bush's approach to international treaties was also pragmatic and unilateral, as seen in the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After the September 11 attacks, the US positioned itself as a leader in the global war on terrorism, expecting nations to stand behind it and threatening those who supported terrorism. The US treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, was pragmatic, with the relationship shifting based on strategic interests. Bush's foreign policy was characterized by a combination of pragmatism and unilateralism, with a focus on advancing US interests and power.
