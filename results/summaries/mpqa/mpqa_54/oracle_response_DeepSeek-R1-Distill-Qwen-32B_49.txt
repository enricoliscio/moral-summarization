Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the US's foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism, especially regarding the NMD deployment, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It also touches on the aftermath of 9/11 and the US's approach to terrorism and Pakistan.

The author uses words like "deploying," "plan," "went," "persuade," etc., which carry moral connotations. I need to ensure these words are included in the summary. I'll structure the summary to cover the key policies and events, highlighting the US's unilateral actions and their implications on international relations and cooperation.

I'll start by introducing the US's role as the sole superpower and its shift towards pragmatism. Then, I'll mention the NMD deployment, the opposition, and Bush's persistence. Next, I'll address the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, noting the US's refusal to enforce or implement them. After that, I'll discuss the 9/11 attacks and the US's response, including the use of the "with us or against us" rhetoric. Finally, I'll touch on the US's pragmatic approach with Pakistan post-9/11.

I need to keep the summary concise, around 200 words, and ensure all the morally framed words are included. I'll make sure each point flows logically and maintains the critical tone towards US unilateralism and pragmatism.

SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, with its foreign policy increasingly driven by pragmatism and unilateralism under Bush. The administration persisted in deploying the National Missile Defense (NMD) system, despite international opposition, including from allies like Canada. Bush sought to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), claiming it was outdated and threatening to scrap it if necessary. The US's actions, including accelerating NMD tests, were seen as an attempt to maintain its superpower status by attacking others while preventing attacks on itself.  

The Sino-US plane collision incident highlighted the US's alternate use of pragmatism and unilateralism. After a Chinese pilot perished, the US refused to apologize, instead detaining its crew and later threatening retaliation using issues like human rights and trade. Bush also adopted a pragmatic stance on international treaties, refusing to enforce the Kyoto Protocol or implement the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and opposing the Biological Weapons Convention's enforcement plan.  

Post-9/11, the US framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, demanding international support and labeling those who opposed it as hostile. However, its treatment of Pakistan demonstrated pragmatism, as the US shifted from imposing sanctions to offering aid after declaring the war on terrorism. The article critiques the US's unilateral actions, emphasizing its disregard for international cooperation and its focus on self-interest.  
END OF SUMMARY.
