SUMMARY: Since the end of the Cold War, the United States, the world's sole superpower, has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy. The Bush administration has consistently pursued its own interests, often at the expense of international cooperation and consensus. Bush's insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD) despite international opposition, his unilateralism in the Sino-US plane collision incident, and his disregard for international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, all illustrate this trend. After the September 11 attacks, the United States rallied global support for its "war on terror," positioning itself as the leader of a global anti-terrorism effort while continuing to act in its self-interest, as evidenced by its pragmatic approach to Pakistan. Bush's foreign policy has been characterized by a mix of pragmatism and unilateralism, with a clear focus on advancing US interests above all else. This approach has raised concerns among the international community, who see the US leveraging its superpower status to pursue its agenda, often disregarding the interests and concerns of other nations.
