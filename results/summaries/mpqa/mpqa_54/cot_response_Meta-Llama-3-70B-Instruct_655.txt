SUMMARY:
The United States, as the world's sole superpower, has adopted a foreign policy of pragmatism and unilateralism under the Bush administration. Despite international opposition, the US has insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System, claiming it will not pose a threat to international security. The US has also refused to enforce the Kyoto Protocol and has let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty "freeze" in the Senate. The Bush administration has used a carrot-and-stick approach to persuade other countries to accept its policies, often ignoring international treaties and organizations that restrict its freedom. In the fight against terrorism, the US has demanded that other countries stand behind it, deciding which countries are its enemies or friends based on their attitude towards it. The US has practiced pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
