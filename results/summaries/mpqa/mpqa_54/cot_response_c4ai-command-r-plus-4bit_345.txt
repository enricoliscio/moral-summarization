SUMMARY: Following the Cold War, the United States, the world's sole superpower, has increasingly embraced unilateralism and pragmatism in its foreign policy. This approach is evident in President Bush's insistence on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community and even US allies. Bush has threatened to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) and has increased funding for the NMD, showcasing his administration's willingness to prioritize US interests above international agreements. In the Sino-US plane collision event, the US demonstrated its unilateralism by refusing to accept responsibility and apologizing, only doing so when pressured by China's firm stance. Bush's administration has also adopted a pragmatic stance towards international treaties, refusing to sign or ratify those that do not benefit US security, economy, and globalization. Post-9/11, the US has used multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism in the "war on terrorism," demanding that all countries stand behind it or be labeled as enemies. While the US has shown pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, its overall approach is marked by unilateralism and self-interest. This moral framing of US foreign policy highlights a disconnect between its actions and the values of responsibility, cooperation, and respect for international law.
