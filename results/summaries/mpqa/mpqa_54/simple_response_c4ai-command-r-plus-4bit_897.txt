SUMMARY: The United States, as the world's sole superpower post-Cold War, has embraced pragmatism and unilateralism as the main tenets of its foreign policy under the Bush administration. The deployment of the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite international opposition, exemplifies this approach, as does the insistence on spying without regard for other nations' sovereignty. Bush's treatment of international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, reflects a willingness to prioritize US interests above global cooperation. Following the September 11 attacks, the US leveraged multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism in the "war on terror," demanding allegiance from other nations while reserving the right to label them as enemies. This approach, marked by pragmatism and unilateralism, seeks to secure the US's superpower status while disregarding the interests of other nations and the constraints of international law.
