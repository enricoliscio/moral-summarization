Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, which includes two main steps. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to write a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about US foreign policy under Bush, focusing on pragmatism and unilateralism. The moral framing here seems to be critical of US actions, so words like "opposed," "domination," "condemnation," etc., are key. I'll list each of these words as per the instructions.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, highlighting the main points: Bush's policies, the NMD, the collision incident, Kyoto Protocol, treaties, and the war on terror. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the author's perspective. I have to be concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting bogged down in details.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the US as a sole superpower, moving through specific policies and incidents, and ending with the implications of their actions. This way, the summary not only captures the events but also the moral critique embedded in the original text.

### SUMMARY:  
Following the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, adopting a foreign policy rooted in pragmatism and unilateralism. Under Bush, the U.S. pursued the National Missile Defense (NMD) system despite global opposition, prioritizing its status as a dominant power. The U.S. also disregarded international treaties like the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol, drawing widespread condemnation. In the Sino-U.S. plane collision incident, the U.S. refused to apologize, later threatening retaliation, highlighting its unilateral approach. Post-9/11, the U.S. framed its "war on terrorism" as a global effort, compelling other nations to align with its agenda. However, its treatment of Pakistan exemplified pragmatic shifts, as the U.S. shifted from imposing sanctions to offering aid based on strategic interests. The article underscores the moral critique of U.S. actions, emphasizing its exploitation of power and disregard for international cooperation.  
END OF SUMMARY.
