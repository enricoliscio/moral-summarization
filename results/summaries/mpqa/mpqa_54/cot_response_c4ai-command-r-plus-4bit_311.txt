SUMMARY:
Following the Cold War, the United States, as the sole superpower, has increasingly embraced pragmatism and unilateralism in its foreign policy under the Bush administration. Bush has insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System (NMD), despite opposition from the international community, including US allies. The US justifies this by claiming it poses no threat to international security and that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is outdated. The US has also shown its unilateralism in the Sino-US plane collision incident, where it refused to take responsibility and apologize, and later threatened China with retaliation. Bush's administration has also demonstrated its pragmatic and unilateral approach to international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After the September 11 attacks, the US launched its "war on terrorism," demanding that all countries stand with it or be considered hostile. The US has used multilateral diplomacy to enhance its unilateralism and has shown pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism. Bush's administration has consistently acted in its self-interest, with little regard for international consensus or morality, enhancing its unilateralism and a pragmatic approach to foreign policy.
