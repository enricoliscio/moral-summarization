SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the United States' foreign policy under the Bush administration, accusing it of pragmatism and unilateralism. The US has pursued its own interests, disregarding international opposition and treaties. The deployment of the National Missile Defense System, despite opposition from the international community, is seen as a prime example of this approach. The article also highlights the US' double standards in the Sino-US plane collision event, where the US refused to apologize and instead threatened to retaliate against China. Furthermore, the US has selectively chosen which international treaties to enforce or ignore, based on its own interests. The article argues that the US' "war on terrorism" is, in reality, a means to enhance its own unilateralism, where countries are forced to choose between supporting the US or being labeled as hostile regimes. The US' treatment of Pakistan, a frontline state in the fight against terrorism, is seen as a prime example of this approach.
