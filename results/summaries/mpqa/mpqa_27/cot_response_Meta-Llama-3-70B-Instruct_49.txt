SUMMARY:
Foreign firms are furiously lobbying in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the government prepares to pass emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. President Eduardo Duhalde's controversial economic package has sparked frantic efforts from U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies, who stand to lose billions of dollars. The president is stunned by the intense lobbying, but remains resolute in his decision. The package aims to ease the pain on the increasingly angry middle class, who hold most of the personal debt in dollars. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may try to do the same in less dire times. The outcome is expected to have a ripple effect, impacting suppliers throughout the chain of supply. END OF SUMMARY.
