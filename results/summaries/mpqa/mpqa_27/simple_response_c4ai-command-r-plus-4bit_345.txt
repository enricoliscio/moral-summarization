SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The lobbying efforts, which included intense pressure on President Eduardo Duhalde and lawmakers, were ultimately unsuccessful as the economic package was passed by the lower house and expected to be approved by the Senate. The package included measures to devalue the peso and scrap the policy that kept the peso's worth the same as the US dollar, which had attracted foreign investment in the 1990s. However, the policy also made Argentine exports uncompetitive and led to a manufacturing exodus to neighboring Brazil. The devaluation is expected to hit foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies hard, with Spanish firms alone estimated to lose more than $3 billion. President Duhalde's package of legislation seeks to ease the burden on Argentina's angry middle class, which holds most of the country's dollar-denominated debt, by converting it into pesos. Foreign companies are worried about the precedent that Argentina's actions could set for other nations, potentially impacting future investments and supply chains throughout Latin America.
END OF SUMMARY.
