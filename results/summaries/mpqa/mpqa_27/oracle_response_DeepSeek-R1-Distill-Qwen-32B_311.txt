Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words: broke, pay, violence, pain, crisis, break. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic policies, which aim to devalue the peso and end the currency parity with the US dollar. The government is struggling to pay its debts and is causing potential losses for foreign firms.

I should highlight that Argentina is broke, unable to pay pensioners and workers. The companies are lobbying to avoid billions in losses, which ties into the 'pay' aspect. The devaluation and breaking of convertibility are key points, using 'break' as a moral term. The crisis is evident, and the fear of street violence adds to the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring the moral words are present. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while covering all critical points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include each moral term appropriately. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers to prevent massive losses as the country seeks to devalue its peso and end its decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to address Argentina's financial crisis but has sparked fears of widespread pain for foreign firms, including banks, phone companies, and energy firms. These companies stand to lose billions if the legislation passes, as it would break the convertibility policy that had attracted foreign investment in the 1990s. Argentina is broke, unable to pay pensioners or state workers, and faces a potential return to street violence as prices for essentials like food and medicine rise. Duhalde's plan also seeks to ease the burden on the middle class by converting dollar-denominated debts into pesos, which would devalue by about 30%. Foreign companies, particularly those from Spain, are concerned that breaking contract promises in Argentina could set a dangerous precedent for other nations. The crisis has led to intense lobbying, with companies seeking to avoid losses, but Duhalde has resisted their efforts, prioritizing the country's economic stability over foreign interests. END OF SUMMARY.
