Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina against a new economic policy. The government is trying to devalue the peso and end the currency parity with the US dollar. This move is expected to cause significant losses for foreign firms. They're really pushing hard to influence the lawmakers, but the president seems surprised by the intensity.

I need to capture the moral aspect here. The companies are trying to protect their investments, but the government is prioritizing the domestic economy and middle class. There's a conflict between foreign interests and national economic stability. Also, the article mentions that foreign companies fear setting a precedent where other countries might break contracts, which is a moral concern about trust in international agreements.

I should make sure the summary highlights the lobbying efforts, the government's stance, and the implications for both foreign companies and Argentina's economy. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with the lobbying, mention the economic package, the impact on foreign firms, the government's resistance, and the broader implications. That should cover the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers to oppose President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The move is expected to cost foreign firms billions, as Argentina faces economic collapse with its government unable to pay pensions or state workers. The lobbying efforts, particularly from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, have been described as "frantic," with analysts estimating potential losses of over $3 billion. Duhalde's plan to devalue the peso and convert consumer debt into pesos could significantly reduce foreign banks' profits, as they seek to maintain the dollar value of debt. The government plans to redirect gas export revenues to support banks, but foreign companies are also fighting to retain billing in dollars for services like utilities and phone bills. The crisis raises concerns about a potential ripple effect, with foreign firms fearing other nations may follow Argentina's lead in breaking contractual promises. Duhalde's package, which passed the lower house, aims to ease the burden on Argentina's middle class, but analysts warn of potential street violence as prices for food and medicine rise. END OF SUMMARY.
