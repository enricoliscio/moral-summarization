SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The lobbying efforts, which included intense pressure on President Eduardo Duhalde and lawmakers, were ultimately unsuccessful as the economic package was passed by the lower house and expected to be approved by the Senate. The package included measures such as the devaluation of the peso, the conversion of dollar-denominated debt to pesos, and the ending of dollar-based billing for utilities and services. The companies, especially those from Spain, feared that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break promises made in contracts. They also wanted to protect their investments and suppliers throughout Latin America. The total losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies were estimated to be in the billions, with Spanish companies alone expected to lose more than $3 billion. The devaluation of the peso and the ending of currency parity were necessary steps to ease the pain on Argentina's angry middle class and address the country's economic crisis. However, political analysts feared that the devaluation could lead to street violence as companies sought to raise prices for food and medicine. The article highlights the moral dilemma between upholding contracts and international investment confidence versus addressing the needs of a suffering middle class and a broken economy.
