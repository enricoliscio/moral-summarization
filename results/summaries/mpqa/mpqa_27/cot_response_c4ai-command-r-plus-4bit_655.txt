END OF SUMMARY. SUMMARY: Foreign firms are furiously lobbying in Argentina to avoid losses as the country faces a financial crisis. President Eduardo Duhalde has proposed a controversial economic package that includes devaluing the peso and ending its currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The intense lobbying efforts have stunned Duhalde, as foreign companies try to resist the potential losses from the proposed changes. The package targets foreign and domestic companies to ease the pain on an angry middle class struggling with debt. More than 80% of personal debt is in dollars, and most of it is held by the middle class. Duhalde proposes to convert this debt into pesos, which could devalue by 30%. Foreign banks, which control almost half of Argentina's deposits, are worried and want the dollar value of debt to remain constant. They are trying to reverse a portion of the package that would end billing in dollars for various services. The president has resisted the lobbying, proposing to shore up banks with gas exports. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina breaks promises made in contracts, other nations might follow suit in less dire times. The potential impact goes beyond Argentina, hitting suppliers and the entire supply chain. U.S. companies, owed over $132 billion, are also trying to resist the proposed changes. END OF SUMMARY.
