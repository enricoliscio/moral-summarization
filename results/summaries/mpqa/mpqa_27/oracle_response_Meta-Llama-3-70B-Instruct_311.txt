SUMMARY:

Foreign firms are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to avoid massive losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-long parity with the US dollar. The economic package, expected to pass, would cause billions of dollars in losses for US and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The government, already "broke" and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, is trying to ease the "pain" on the middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos. However, foreign companies are resisting, fearing that if Argentina "breaks" its promises, other nations may follow suit. The crisis has sparked concerns of a return to "violence" as companies seek to raise prices for food and medicine. The government's plan to grant special powers to the president and devalue the peso has sparked intense lobbying, with foreign firms trying to protect their investments.
