Alright, I need to summarize this news article about foreign firms lobbying in Argentina. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the conflict between foreign companies and the Argentine government's economic policies.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about how foreign multinationals are lobbying against President Duhalde's economic package, which includes devaluing the peso and ending the currency parity with the dollar. This is causing billions in potential losses for these companies.

I notice the moral angle here: the companies are trying to protect their investments, but the government is taking measures to stabilize the economy, which might hurt the middle class if not addressed. There's a tension between foreign interests and domestic economic stability.

I should highlight the lobbying efforts, the impact on foreign companies, and the government's stance. Also, the article mentions the potential ripple effect on other countries if Argentina changes its contracts, which adds another layer to the moral implications.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing. I'll structure it to show the companies' desperation, the government's tough decisions, and the broader implications for international investments.

Let me start by outlining the key points: foreign firms lobbying, potential losses, devaluation impact, government's response, middle-class relief, and the global repercussions. I'll weave these into a coherent summary that reflects the moral conflict between economic stability and foreign investment protection.

SUMMARY:  
Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers to prevent losses from President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which seeks to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. U.S. and other foreign banks, telecoms, transport, and energy firms stand to lose billions if the legislation passes. The lobbying efforts, particularly from Spanish companies, have been described as "frantic," with analysts estimating potential losses exceeding $3 billion. The package, which passed the lower house and is expected to gain Senate approval, aims to ease the economic crisis but has drawn opposition from foreign firms worried about the devaluation's impact on their investments.  

Duhalde's plan includes converting consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce the value of loans for middle-class Argentines but conflict with foreign banks' desire to maintain dollar-linked debt. Foreign companies are also opposing measures to end billing in dollars for services like gas, phone, and utilities. The situation highlights concerns that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to renege on contractual obligations, potentially harming global investments.  

The government, struggling to stabilize the economy and prevent social unrest, is prioritizing domestic relief over foreign interests, raising fears of rising prices and potential street violence. The crisis underscores the tension between protecting foreign investments and addressing Argentina's deep economic challenges.
