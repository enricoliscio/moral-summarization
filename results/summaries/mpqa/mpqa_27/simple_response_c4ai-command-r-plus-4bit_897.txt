SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are lobbying intensely to prevent losses resulting from Argentina's economic crisis and the government's plan to devalue the peso. The companies, especially banks and energy and telecommunications firms from Spain, stand to lose billions of dollars if President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package is approved. The package includes proposals to end the country's currency parity with the U.S. dollar and to convert dollar-denominated debt to pesos, which would reduce the value of their investments and profits. The companies argue that Argentina's decision to break its promises and contracts could set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow suit. They fear not only immediate losses in Argentina but also potential impacts on their supply chains throughout the region. However, Duhalde's package aims to ease the burden on Argentina's struggling middle class, which has been hit hard by the economic crisis. The president is facing a difficult balance between upholding commitments to foreign investors and addressing the urgent needs of his country's citizens.
