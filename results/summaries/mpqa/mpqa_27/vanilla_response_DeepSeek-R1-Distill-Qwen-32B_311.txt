Alright, I need to summarize this news article about foreign firms lobbying in Argentina. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about foreign multinationals lobbying Argentine lawmakers and the new government before a vote on emergency legislation. The legislation aims to devalue the peso and end the currency parity with the US dollar. Companies like banks, telecoms, transport, and energy firms are expected to lose billions if the bill passes.

President Duhalde's economic package is controversial. He's facing intense lobbying, with many calls from various groups opposing the changes. Despite this, the package passed in the lower house and is expected to pass in the Senate.

The companies are worried because the devaluation and ending convertibility will affect their profits. Convertibility in the 90s attracted foreign investment, but it made exports too expensive, leading manufacturers to move elsewhere. Now, Argentina is in a financial crisis, unable to pay pensions or workers, and has withdrawal limits to prevent bank runs.

Duhalde's plan includes converting personal debts into pesos, which would reduce the value of loans. Foreign banks, controlling nearly half of deposits, oppose this. The government plans to use gas exports to help banks. Companies are also trying to stop changes in billing practices, fearing it sets a bad precedent for contract obligations.

The article mentions that foreign companies, especially from Spain, are concerned about the impact on their investments across Latin America. The economic measures could have ripple effects, affecting suppliers and investors globally.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the lobbying efforts, the economic package's goals, the impact on foreign firms, the government's response, and the broader implications.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Introduction: Foreign firms lobbying against Argentina's economic measures.
2. Details of the economic package: Devaluation, ending convertibility, impact on foreign investments.
3. The lobbying efforts and the government's stance.
4. The financial crisis in Argentina and the effects on the economy.
5. Duhalde's plan to help the middle class and the opposition from foreign banks.
6. Broader implications for foreign investments and potential ripple effects.

I need to ensure it's concise, covering all key points without going into too much detail. Also, I should avoid jargon and keep it clear.

Let me draft the summary:

"Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers to prevent losses from President Duhalde's economic package, which seeks to devalue the peso and end the currency's parity with the US dollar. The legislation, approved by the lower house and expected Senate passage, aims to address Argentina's financial crisis, including unpaid pensions and worker salaries, by restructuring debts and adjusting economic policies. Foreign banks and companies, particularly from Spain, are concerned about losing billions due to the devaluation and changes in billing practices. Duhalde's plan includes converting personal debts into pesos, reducing their value, and using gas exports to support banks. The measures have sparked fears of a ripple effect, potentially affecting foreign investments across Latin America and beyond. The government's actions highlight a broader struggle to balance domestic economic relief with foreign investor interests."

That's about 150 words. I can add a bit more detail to reach closer to 200 without being too verbose.

Final summary:

"Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers to prevent billions in losses from President Duhalde's economic package, which seeks to devalue the peso and end the currency's decade-long parity with the US dollar. The legislation, approved by the lower house and expected Senate passage, aims to address Argentina's financial crisis, including unpaid pensions and worker salaries, by restructuring debts and adjusting economic policies. Foreign banks and companies, particularly from Spain, are concerned about losing billions due to the devaluation and changes in billing practices. Duhalde's plan includes converting personal debts into pesos, reducing their value, and using gas exports to support banks. The measures have sparked fears of a ripple effect, potentially affecting foreign investments across Latin America and beyond. The government's actions highlight a broader struggle to balance domestic economic relief with foreign investor interests, raising concerns about contract obligations and investment security in the region."

That should be around 180 words. I think it covers all the essential points succinctly.
