SUMMARY:
Foreign firms are furiously lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The package is expected to pass, despite intense efforts to block it, and would result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The president is "stunned" by the lobbying efforts, which he considers "unfair". The package seeks to ease the "pain" on the middle class, who hold most of the country's debt in dollars. Foreign companies are "worried" about the potential losses and are trying to "resist" the changes. The government's decision to devalue the peso is seen as a "frantic" attempt to address the country's economic crisis. The outcome is expected to have a "ripple effect" on the economy, with many fearing a return to "angry" street violence. END OF SUMMARY.
