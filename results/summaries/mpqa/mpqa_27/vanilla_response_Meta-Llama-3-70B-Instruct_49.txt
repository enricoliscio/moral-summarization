SUMMARY:

Foreign companies are intensely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reject President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which would devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The companies are worried about losing profits due to the devaluation, which would make Argentine exports more expensive abroad. The government is trying to ease the pain on the middle class, who hold most of the personal debt in dollars. The package proposes to convert mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce the debt burden. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may follow suit. The outcome of this crisis has far-reaching implications for foreign investment in Latin America.
