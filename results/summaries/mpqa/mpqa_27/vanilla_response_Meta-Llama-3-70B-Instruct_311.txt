SUMMARY:

Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The companies are worried about the proposal to devalue the peso, which would make their profits in pesos worth less in dollars. The government is trying to ease the pain on the middle class, which holds most of the personal debt in dollars, by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may try to do the same. The package is expected to pass, despite intense lobbying, and could have a ripple effect on investments throughout Latin America.
