SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country faces a dire economic crisis. The government is broke and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, leading to a potential return to street violence. President Eduardo Duhalde proposes a controversial economic package that includes devaluing the peso and ending its currency parity with the U.S. dollar, which could result in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The package seeks to ease the pain on the angry middle class, which holds most of the country's debt, by converting their debt to pesos. Foreign companies fear that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break promises made in contracts. The continuing effect of the crisis could impact foreign investment and supply chains throughout Latin America. The intense lobbying efforts may be in vain as the economic package is expected to gain easy passage in the Senate. Argentina's crisis and the potential moral consequences of its actions have the world on edge.
END OF SUMMARY.
