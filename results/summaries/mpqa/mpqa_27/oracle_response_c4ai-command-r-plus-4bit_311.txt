SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country faces a dire economic crisis. The government is broke and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, leading to a potential return to street violence. President Eduardo Duhalde proposes devaluing the peso and ending currency parity with the U.S. dollar, which could result in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The most intense lobbying comes from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose more than $3 billion collectively. The economic package passed by the lower house seeks to ease the pain on the angry middle class, which holds most of the dollar-denominated debt. Duhalde's proposal to convert this debt into pesos has met resistance from foreign banks. The issue at hand is not just about Argentina's crisis but also about upholding promises made in contracts, as a success in Argentina could set a precedent for other nations. The continuing effect of this crisis could impact suppliers throughout the supply chain. The situation in Argentina highlights a painful break in promises and a challenging crisis for all involved.
END OF SUMMARY.
