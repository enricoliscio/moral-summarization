SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby Argentine lawmakers to prevent billions in losses due to the country's impending currency devaluation. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to devalue the peso and end its decade-old parity with the US dollar. US and foreign companies in banking, telecommunications, transport, and energy sectors are expected to lose billions. The most intense lobbying comes from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose over $3 billion collectively. Duhalde's package seeks to ease the burden on Argentina's struggling middle class by converting their dollar-denominated debt into pesos and devaluing the currency. Foreign companies are concerned about the potential breach of contracts and the ripple effect it could have on their investments in other Latin American countries. They seek some form of indexing to raise their prices and compensate for the expected gap between the peso and dollar, but this appears unlikely. The economic package passed the lower house and is expected to be approved by the Senate, despite the lobbying efforts. The article highlights the complexities of Argentina's economic crisis and the impact on foreign investors. END OF SUMMARY.
