SUMMARY:

Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reject President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The companies are worried about the devaluation, which would make Argentine exports more expensive and reduce their profits. The government is trying to ease the pain on the middle class, who hold most of the country's debt in dollars. The package proposes to convert mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce the debt burden. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina can break contracts, other nations may follow, causing a ripple effect throughout the region. The package is expected to pass, despite intense lobbying efforts.
