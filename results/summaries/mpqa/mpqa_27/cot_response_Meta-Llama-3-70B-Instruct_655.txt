SUMMARY:
Foreign firms are furiously lobbying in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-old parity with the US dollar. The controversial economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, has sparked frantic efforts from US and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies to reverse the package. The president is stunned by the intense lobbying, but remains resolute. The package is expected to pass, despite the furious efforts of foreign companies, which stand to lose billions of dollars. The move is seen as painful for foreign investors, but necessary to ease the pain on Argentina's increasingly angry middle class. The government is broke and cannot pay pensioners or state workers, and the devaluation is expected to lead to a run on the banking system. END OF SUMMARY.
