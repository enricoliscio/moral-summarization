SUMMARY:
Foreign firms are furiously lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The president is stunned by the intense efforts to reverse the package, which is seen as painful for foreign companies. However, Duhalde is resistant to their demands, seeking to ease the pain on the increasingly angry middle class. The package proposes to convert mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would help the middle class but hurt foreign banks. Foreign companies are fearful that if Argentina breaks promises made in contracts, other nations may follow suit. The outcome of this crisis could have a ripple effect on investments throughout Latin America. END OF SUMMARY.
