Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about foreign firms lobbying in Argentina. They provided the article, and they specified that the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it needs to be under 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic measures. The key points are the devaluation of the peso, ending the currency parity with the dollar, and the impact on foreign investments.

I should identify who the main players are: foreign multinationals like banks, telecoms, transport, and energy companies. They're trying to prevent losses from the new legislation. The legislation is part of President Duhalde's economic package, which includes devaluation and ending convertibility.

The article mentions that the package was passed by the lower house and expected to pass the Senate. There's significant opposition from companies, especially Spanish ones, which stand to lose over $3 billion. The convertibility policy in the 90s attracted foreign investment but made exports too expensive, leading to Argentina's economic crisis.

Duhalde's plan aims to help the middle class by converting their debts into pesos, which would reduce their burden if the peso devalues. However, foreign banks want to keep their dollar debts constant. The government is also taking gas exports to support banks.

Foreign companies are also worried about the precedent this sets, fearing other countries might break contract promises. The article mentions that U.S. companies have significant investments in Argentina, particularly in petroleum, gas, telecom, and energy.

So, the summary should cover the lobbying efforts, the economic measures, the impact on foreign companies, the reasons behind the policies, and the broader implications for foreign investments elsewhere.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the lobbying, then the legislation, its effects, and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers and new government to prevent losses from President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which includes devaluing the peso and ending the decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The legislation, passed by the lower house and expected to pass the Senate, aims to address Argentina's economic crisis, but foreign banks, telecoms, transport, and energy firms stand to lose billions. Companies from Spain, including banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, are particularly vocal, fearing losses of over $3 billion. The convertibility policy in the 1990s attracted foreign investment but made Argentine exports overpriced, leading to economic decline. Duhalde's plan includes converting consumer debt into pesos, benefiting the middle class, but foreign banks oppose this, wanting to keep dollar debts constant. The government plans to use gas exports to support banks. Foreign firms also oppose ending dollar billing for services, fearing a precedent for breaking contract promises. The crisis could impact investments across Latin America, with U.S. companies holding over $16 billion in investments in Argentina, mainly in oil, gas, telecom, and energy. END OF SUMMARY.
