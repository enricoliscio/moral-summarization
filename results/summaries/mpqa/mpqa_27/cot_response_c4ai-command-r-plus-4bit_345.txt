SUMMARY: In 2002, foreign multinational companies furiously lobbied Argentine lawmakers and the new government to avoid devastating losses ahead of a final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The intense lobbying efforts, which stunned President Eduardo Duhalde, were largely unsuccessful, as the controversial economic package was passed by the lower house and expected to gain approval in the Senate. Frantic companies, especially those from Spain, stood to lose billions due to their worries about the devaluation of the peso and the scrapping of a policy that had attracted foreign investment in the 1990s. Argentina was facing a dire economic crisis, with an overpriced currency, broke government, and angry middle class. President Duhalde's package sought to ease the pain of the angry middle class by granting himself vast special powers over the economy, including the ability to resist lobbying efforts and shore up banks at the expense of foreign companies. Foreign firms tried to reverse portions of the package, especially those that would impact their direct investments in Argentina and their suppliers throughout the chain of supply. The potential impact of Argentina's crisis went beyond its borders, as foreign companies feared that other nations might try to break promises made in contracts during less dire times.
