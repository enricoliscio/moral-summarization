SUMMARY:

Foreign firms are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for US and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The government is "broke" and cannot pay pensioners or state workers, and is trying to ease the "pain" on the middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos. Foreign companies are worried that if Argentina can "break" promises made in contracts, other nations may follow suit. The package has sparked fears of "violence" and a "crisis" in the country. The government's plan to take gas exports to shore up banks may help alleviate some losses, but foreign companies are unlikely to get indexing to raise prices. The outcome of this economic battle will have a "ripple effect" on investments throughout Latin America.

END OF SUMMARY.
