SUMMARY:

Foreign companies are intensely lobbying Argentine lawmakers and the new government to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which would devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to pass, causing billions of dollars in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The companies are worried about the proposal to devalue the peso, which would affect their profits and investments in Argentina. The government is trying to ease the pain on the middle class, who hold most of the country's debt in dollars. The package proposes to convert mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce the debt burden. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may try to do the same. The outcome of the vote will have a ripple effect on investments throughout Latin America.
