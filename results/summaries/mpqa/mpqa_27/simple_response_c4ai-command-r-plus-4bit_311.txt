SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The lobbying efforts, which surprised President Eduardo Duhalde, were ultimately unsuccessful as the economic package was passed by the lower house and expected to pass in the Senate. The package includes measures to devalue the peso and scrap the convertibility policy, which will result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The devaluation will also impact foreign companies' billing practices, as they will no longer be able to bill in dollars for services such as gas, phone services, and power. The fear is that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may follow suit. The package also seeks to ease the burden on the middle class by converting their dollar-denominated debt into pesos, which will reduce the value of their loans and mortgages. The situation in Argentina highlights the complex ethical implications of economic policy decisions and the potential impact on different stakeholders, including foreign investors, local businesses, and the middle class.
