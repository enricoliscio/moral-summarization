SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby Argentine lawmakers to avoid losses ahead of a final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso. The economic package, which passed the lower house and is expected to pass the Senate, includes proposals to end currency parity with the U.S. dollar and convert personal debt to pesos, impacting foreign banks and companies. The total loss for foreign companies is estimated to be in the billions of dollars, with Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms expected to lose over $3 billion alone. President Duhalde's package seeks to ease the burden on the middle class, as more than 80% of personal debt is in dollars. Foreign companies fear that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break promises made in contracts. The continuing effect could impact suppliers throughout the supply chain. U.S. companies had investments totaling over $16 billion in Argentina as of 1999, primarily in petroleum, telecommunications, and energy.
