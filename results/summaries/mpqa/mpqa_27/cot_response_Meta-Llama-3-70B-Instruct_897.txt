SUMMARY:
Foreign firms are furiously lobbying in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the government prepares to pass emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The controversial economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, has sparked intense efforts from U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies to reverse the package. The president is stunned by the lobbying, saying he has never had so many calls in his life from all the groups saying they don't want the government to touch them. The package is expected to pass, despite the worried efforts of foreign companies, who fear a ripple effect that could impact investments in other Latin American countries. The government's move is seen as painful for foreign companies, but a necessary step to ease the pain on Argentina's increasingly angry middle class. END OF SUMMARY.
