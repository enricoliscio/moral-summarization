SUMMARY: 
Foreign multinational companies frantically lobbied Argentine lawmakers to prevent billions in losses due to the devaluation of the peso. The intense efforts shocked President Duhalde, who nonetheless pushed through an emergency package granting him special powers to address the economic crisis. More than 80% of personal debt in Argentina is in dollars, and devaluation will cause significant losses for foreign banks, telecoms, and energy companies. The companies fear that Argentina's decision to break promises made in contracts could set a dangerous precedent for other nations. Lawmakers were unable to reverse the devaluation, and companies now face the challenge of managing the impact on their operations.
