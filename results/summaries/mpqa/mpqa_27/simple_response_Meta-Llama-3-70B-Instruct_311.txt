SUMMARY:

Foreign multinational companies are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reverse President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The companies, including U.S. and Spanish banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy firms, stand to lose billions of dollars if the package is approved. The package seeks to ease the pain on Argentina's middle class, which holds most of the country's personal debt in dollars. The government plans to convert mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce the debt burden on citizens. Foreign companies, however, want the dollar value of debt to remain constant, and are worried that if Argentina breaks its promises, other nations may follow suit. The package is expected to pass, sparking fears of street violence and price hikes.
