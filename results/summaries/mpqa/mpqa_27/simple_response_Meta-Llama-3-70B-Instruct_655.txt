SUMMARY:

Foreign multinational companies are fiercely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to prevent the passage of emergency legislation that would devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The companies, including US and Spanish banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy firms, stand to lose billions of dollars if the legislation is approved. The package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to ease the pain on the middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would reduce their value. However, foreign companies want the dollar value of debt to remain constant, and are trying to reverse the proposal. The outcome has broader implications, as it could set a precedent for other countries to renege on contracts. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the interests of foreign corporations are pitted against the needs of the Argentine people, who are struggling to make ends meet.
