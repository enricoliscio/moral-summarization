SUMMARY:

Foreign firms are furiously lobbying Argentine lawmakers to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue the peso and end its decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, is expected to pass despite intense opposition from foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. These companies, particularly those from Spain, stand to lose over $3 billion if the package is approved. The government, which is "broke" and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, is trying to ease the "pain" on the middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos. However, this move is expected to lead to "street violence" as companies raise prices for food and medicine to avoid losses. The crisis has sparked fears that other nations may try to "break" promises made in contracts, causing a "ripple effect" throughout the region. END OF SUMMARY.
