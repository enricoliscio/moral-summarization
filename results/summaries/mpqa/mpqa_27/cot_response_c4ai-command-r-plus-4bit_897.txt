SUMMARY:
Foreign multinational companies are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to avoid devastating losses as the country prepares to devalue the peso and sever its decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The lobbying efforts, described as *intense* and even *furious*, come ahead of a final vote on President Eduardo Duhalde's *controversial* economic package. This package seeks to alleviate the suffering of Argentina's *angry* middle class – the largest in South America – by *granting* the president *special powers* over the economy. U.S. and foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies stand to lose billions due to their significant *investments* and *debt* in the country. The proposed devaluation of the peso and the scrapping of currency parity threaten to undermine the promises made to these companies when they initially invested in Argentina. The situation has raised moral concerns, as President Duhalde is faced with the dilemma of prioritizing either foreign companies' interests or the welfare of Argentina's struggling middle class, to whom the country *owes* billions in *debt*. Duhalde has *resisted* intense lobbying by foreign interests, prioritizing the needs of his citizens. The outcome will have a *ripple effect* on foreign *investments* throughout Latin America, as companies fear other nations may follow Argentina's lead in reneging on contractual promises during times of economic crisis.
