SUMMARY:

Foreign companies, including US and Spanish banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy firms, are fiercely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to reject President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which would devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The companies stand to lose billions of dollars if the package is approved. The package aims to ease the pain on Argentina's middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, but foreign companies want the dollar value of debt to remain constant. The companies are also trying to reverse a proposal to end billing in dollars for services like gas, phone, and power. Analysts fear that if Argentina breaks its contracts, other nations may follow, causing a ripple effect throughout the region. The package is expected to pass despite the intense lobbying efforts.
