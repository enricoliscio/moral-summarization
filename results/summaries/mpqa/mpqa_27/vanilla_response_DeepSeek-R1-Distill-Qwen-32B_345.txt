Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina over some economic legislation. The key points are the foreign firms trying to avoid losses by lobbying against the devaluation of the peso. The government is passing this package despite the intense lobbying, which includes devaluing the peso and ending the currency parity with the dollar. 

I should note that companies from the US and other countries are expected to lose billions. The economic package was passed by the lower house and is expected to go through the Senate. The companies are worried because the devaluation will affect their profits, especially since they were promised stable exchange rates in the 1990s. 

The article also mentions that Argentina is facing economic crisis, unable to pay pensions and state workers, leading to restrictions on cash withdrawals. There's concern about rising prices and potential street violence. The government is trying to help the middle class by converting their debts into pesos, which would reduce their burden if the peso devalues. 

Foreign banks control a lot of deposits and want to keep their dollar values unchanged. The government is planning to use gas exports to help the banks. Companies are also fighting against ending billing in dollars for services like gas, phones, and utilities. There's a fear that this could set a precedent for other countries to break contract promises. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the lobbying, the economic package, the impact on foreign companies, the devaluation, the government's measures, and the potential ripple effects.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentine lawmakers to prevent billions in losses as the country's lower house approves President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package to devalue the peso and end its decade-long parity with the U.S. dollar. The package, which aims to address Argentina's economic crisis, has faced fierce opposition from banks, telecoms, transport, and energy firms, particularly those from Spain. These companies stand to lose over $3 billion due to the devaluation and the end of the convertibility policy, which had attracted foreign investment in the 1990s. Argentina's government, unable to meet its obligations, is seeking to ease the middle class's financial burden by converting consumer debts into pesos, which would reduce their value if the peso devalues by 30%. Foreign banks, controlling nearly half of Argentina's deposits, oppose this move, fearing losses. Duhalde plans to use gas exports to support banks. The crisis has sparked fears of rising prices and potential street violence. The legislative package, which also targets billing in dollars for services, could set a precedent for other nations to break contractual promises, raising concerns among foreign investors. END OF SUMMARY.
