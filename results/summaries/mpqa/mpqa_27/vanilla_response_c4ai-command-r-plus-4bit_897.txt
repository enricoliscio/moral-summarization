SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are lobbying intensely against President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which seeks to devalue the Argentine peso and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The package is expected to result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The most frantic lobbying is coming from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose over $3 billion collectively. Duhalde's package aims to ease the burden on Argentina's struggling middle class by converting their dollar-denominated debt into pesos and devaluing the currency. Foreign companies are concerned about the potential losses and are trying to protect their investments. They also worry that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break promises made in contracts. The economic package has passed the lower house and is expected to gain approval in the Senate, despite the lobbying efforts. The devaluation measure may lead to street violence as companies seek to raise prices for food and medicine. Duhalde's proposal also includes plans to take gas exports to shore up banks.
