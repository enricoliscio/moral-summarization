SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobbied Argentine lawmakers to avoid losses ahead of a final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its currency parity with the US dollar. The economic package, which passed the lower house and is expected to pass the Senate, will result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The most intense lobbying came from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose over $3 billion collectively. President Duhalde's package seeks to ease the pain of Argentina's middle class by converting their dollar-denominated debt to pesos and devaluing the peso. Foreign companies are also trying to reverse a portion of the package that ends billing in dollars for various services. They fear that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break promises made in contracts. The issue has broader implications for foreign investment in Latin America.
END OF SUMMARY.
