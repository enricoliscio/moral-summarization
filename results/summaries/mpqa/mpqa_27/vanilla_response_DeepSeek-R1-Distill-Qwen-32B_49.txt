Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina before a vote on economic legislation. The key points are that foreign multinationals are trying to prevent losses from devaluing the peso and ending currency parity with the dollar. The economic package includes devaluation and changing the convertibility policy, which was attractive in the 90s but led to issues. Companies like banks, telecoms, and energy firms are expected to lose billions. The lobbying was intense, especially from Spanish companies. The government is struggling, can't pay pensions or workers, and has limits on cash withdrawals. The middle class is suffering, and Duhalde's plan aims to ease their pain by converting debts into pesos, which would reduce their burden. Foreign banks oppose this, wanting to keep debt in dollars. The article also mentions fears that this could set a precedent for other countries. I should capture all these points concisely, making sure to stay under 200 words. I'll structure it by first mentioning the lobbying, the economic measures, the impact on companies, government issues, and the implications for foreign investments and other countries. Make sure to include key details like the $3 billion loss estimate and the 30% devaluation expectation. Also, note the middle class focus and the potential ripple effect on other nations. Keep it clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensively lobbying Argentina's lawmakers and new government to prevent billions in losses as the country prepares to vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. U.S. and foreign banks, telecoms, transport, and energy firms stand to lose collectively billions if the legislation passes. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to address Argentina's financial crisis by devaluing the peso and scrapping the convertibility policy, which tied the peso's value to the dollar. This policy, while attracting foreign investment in the 1990s, made Argentine exports overpriced and led to economic decline. The government, unable to pay pensions or state workers, has imposed limits on cash withdrawals to prevent a banking collapse. Duhalde's plan includes converting personal debts under $100,000 into pesos, reducing their value, but foreign banks oppose this, wanting to maintain dollar-based debt. Foreign companies, particularly Spanish firms, fear the precedent of breaking contract promises. The legislation is expected to pass, with analysts estimating a potential $3 billion loss for companies. The move could have ripple effects across Latin America, affecting suppliers and investors. END OF SUMMARY.
