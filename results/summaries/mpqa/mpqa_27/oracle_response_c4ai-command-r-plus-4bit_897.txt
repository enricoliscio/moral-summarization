SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country faces a dire economic crisis. Argentina is broke and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, leading to a potential return to street violence as companies seek to raise prices for food and medicine. President Eduardo Duhalde proposes devaluing the peso and ending its decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar, which could result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The most frantic lobbying comes from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose more than $3 billion collectively. The economic package passed by the lower house seeks to ease the pain on the angry middle class, who hold most of the country's debt, at the expense of foreign and domestic companies. The crisis in Argentina has far-reaching implications, with foreign companies fearing that other nations may break promises made in contracts if Argentina sets a precedent.
