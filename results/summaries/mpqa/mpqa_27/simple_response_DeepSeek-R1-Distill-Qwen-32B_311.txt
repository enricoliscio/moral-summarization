Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they're a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic measures. The government is trying to devalue the peso and end the currency parity with the dollar, which would affect foreign firms' profits.

I notice the moral aspect here: the conflict between protecting domestic interests and honoring contracts. The companies are upset because they might lose billions, but the government is trying to stabilize the economy and help the middle class. There's also the issue of setting a precedent for other countries to break contracts, which could affect future investments.

I should highlight how the government's actions might be seen as breaking promises, which is a moral dilemma. Also, the impact on the middle class and the potential for social unrest adds another layer to the ethical considerations.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral framing without being too technical. I'll structure it to show the tension between the government's necessary economic measures and the foreign companies' concerns, emphasizing the ethical implications of contract-breaking and its broader effects.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY:  
Foreign multinational companies are fiercely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent losses from President Eduardo Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the currency's decade-long parity with the U.S. dollar. U.S. and European firms, including banks, telecoms, and energy companies, stand to lose billions if the legislation passes, as it would reduce the value of their dollar-denominated assets. The government, facing a severe economic crisis, is prioritizing relief for the middle class over foreign investors. Duhalde's plan includes converting consumer debt into pesos, which would lower the real value of loans, while foreign banks seek to maintain dollar values. Companies argue that breaking these contracts could set a dangerous precedent, discouraging future investments globally. The moral dilemma lies in balancing the urgent need to stabilize Argentina's economy against the potential for undermining contractual obligations and investor trust. The government's actions highlight the tension between domestic economic survival and the ethical implications of altering agreements to protect foreign interests. END OF SUMMARY.
