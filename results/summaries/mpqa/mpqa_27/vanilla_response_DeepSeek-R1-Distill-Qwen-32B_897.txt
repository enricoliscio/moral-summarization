Alright, I need to summarize this news article about foreign firms lobbying in Argentina. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about foreign multinationals lobbying to prevent Argentina's economic package, which includes devaluing the peso and ending the currency parity with the US dollar. This change is expected to cause significant losses for these companies. The president, Eduardo Duhalde, is facing intense pressure from these firms, including banks, telecoms, transport, and energy companies.

I should note the main consequences: foreign companies could lose billions, the devaluation plan is likely to pass, and the impact on Argentina's economy. Also, the article mentions the middle class's debt in dollars and how Duhalde's plan affects mortgages and loans. Foreign banks are particularly worried about their dollar-denominated debts.

Additionally, the article discusses the broader implications for foreign investments in Latin America and the potential ripple effect if Argentina changes its contracts. There's also mention of the political instability and fears of social unrest due to rising prices.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the lobbying efforts, the economic package's content, the potential losses, the government's stance, and the wider implications for foreign investments.

Let me structure the summary: start with the lobbying efforts, mention the economic package, the expected losses, the middle class debt conversion, the foreign banks' concerns, and the broader impact on investments in Latin America. Conclude with the political and social implications.

I should ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding too much detail but covering all main points. Also, make sure to mention that the package is expected to pass despite the lobbying.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's lawmakers and new government to prevent the passage of emergency legislation that would devalue the peso and end its decade-long parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, is expected to cost foreign firms billions in losses. Companies from industries like banking, telecommunications, and energy are particularly concerned, with Spanish firms leading the lobbying efforts. The legislation aims to alleviate the financial crisis by converting personal debts under $100,000 into pesos, which is expected to devalue by about 30%. Foreign banks, controlling nearly half of Argentina's deposits, oppose this plan, fearing losses from dollar-denominated debts. The government plans to use gas exports to bolster banks. The package also targets billing in dollars for services like gas, phone, and utilities, raising concerns among foreign investors about potential breaches of contract. Analysts warn of a ripple effect, potentially affecting investments across Latin America. The bill, which has passed the lower house and is expected to gain Senate approval, has sparked fears of social unrest as prices for essentials may rise. END OF SUMMARY.
