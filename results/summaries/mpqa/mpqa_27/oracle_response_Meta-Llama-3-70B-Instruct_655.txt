SUMMARY:

Foreign firms are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to avoid massive losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-long parity with the US dollar. The proposed economic package, expected to pass, would cause US and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies to collectively lose billions of dollars. The government, already "broke" and unable to "pay" pensioners or state workers, is trying to ease the "pain" on the middle class by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos. However, foreign companies fear this would allow Argentina to "break" its promises and contracts, setting a dangerous precedent for other nations. Analysts warn that the devaluation could lead to "violence" and a "crisis" as companies raise prices for essential goods. The government's plan to take gas exports to shore up banks may not be enough to mitigate the losses.

END OF SUMMARY.
