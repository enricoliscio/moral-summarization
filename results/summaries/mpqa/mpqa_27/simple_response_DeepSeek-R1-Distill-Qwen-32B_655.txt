Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina against new economic legislation. The government is trying to devalue the peso and end the currency parity with the dollar. Foreign firms, like banks, telecoms, and energy companies, are worried they'll lose billions. They're lobbying hard, especially Spanish companies, who are trying to reverse the package. The government, led by President Duhalde, is passing this package to help the middle class, but it's affecting foreign investments. The article also mentions that the debt is mostly in dollars, so converting to pesos could reduce the burden on people but hurt foreign banks. There's a fear that other countries might follow Argentina's lead, affecting global investments.

Now, the moral framing seems to be about the conflict between the government's economic measures to help its citizens and the foreign companies' interests. The government is seen as struggling to balance domestic needs against foreign investors. There's also a moral concern about whether countries should keep their promises to foreign investors or prioritize their own economic stability.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I'll mention the lobbying, the economic package, the impact on foreign companies, the government's intent to help the middle class, and the potential ripple effect on global investments. I'll also note the tension between domestic needs and foreign interests.

Let me structure it: start with the lobbying efforts, mention the economic package, the impact on foreign firms, the government's intent, the moral dilemma, and the potential consequences. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are fiercely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent losses from President Duhalde's economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the dollar parity. The package, expected to pass, would allow consumer debt to be converted into pesos, reducing foreign banks' and companies' revenues. Spanish firms, especially, are leading the lobbying efforts, fearing billions in losses. Duhalde's measures target the middle class, converting debts into pesos to ease their burden, but foreign banks oppose this, wanting to maintain dollar values. The government plans to use gas exports to support banks, but foreign companies seek price adjustments to offset peso devaluation. The crisis raises concerns about Argentina's ability to honor contracts, potentially setting a precedent for other nations. Analysts warn of a ripple effect, impacting global investments and supply chains. The situation highlights the moral dilemma of prioritizing domestic economic relief over foreign investment commitments. END OF SUMMARY.
