SUMMARY:

Foreign companies are fiercely lobbying against Argentina's emergency economic package, which aims to devalue the peso and end the country's currency parity with the US dollar. The package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, would cause significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies, with estimated losses of over $3 billion. The companies are worried about the devaluation of the peso, which would make their profits in pesos worth less in dollars. The package seeks to ease the pain on the middle class, who hold most of the personal debt in dollars, by converting mortgages and car loans into pesos. Foreign companies, especially those from Spain, fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may try to do the same. The moral framing of this issue is one of fairness and accountability, with the Argentine government trying to prioritize the needs of its citizens over the interests of foreign corporations.
