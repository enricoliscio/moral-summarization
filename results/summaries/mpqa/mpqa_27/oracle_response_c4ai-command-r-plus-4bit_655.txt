SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobbied Argentine lawmakers and the new government to avoid billions in losses ahead of a final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, which passed the lower house and is expected to gain approval in the Senate, seeks to ease the pain on an increasingly angry middle class, the largest in South America, at the expense of foreign and domestic companies. Argentina is broke and cannot pay pensioners or state workers. It has also imposed a $250-per-week limit on cash withdrawals to prevent a run on the banks. There are fears of a return to street violence as companies may seek to avoid losses by raising prices for food and medicine following the devaluation. The package grants special powers over the economy to President Duhalde, who has announced that Argentina cannot pay its creditors the $132 billion they are owed. More than 80% of personal debt in Argentina is in dollars, and Duhalde proposes converting this debt into pesos, which would reduce the burden on debtors but hurt foreign banks. Foreign companies are also concerned about the end of billing in dollars for various services, as it breaks promises made in contracts. They fear that other nations may follow Argentina's example in less dire times. The crisis in Argentina has wide-ranging effects, impacting not just direct investment in the country but also suppliers throughout the supply chain.
END OF SUMMARY.
