SUMMARY:

Foreign firms are frantically lobbying Argentine lawmakers to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-long parity with the US dollar. The economic package, expected to pass, would cause significant pain to foreign companies, including US and Spanish banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies, which stand to lose billions of dollars. The government, broke and unable to pay pensioners or state workers, is trying to ease the crisis by converting mortgages and consumer debt into pesos, which would help the middle class but hurt foreign banks. Foreign companies fear that if Argentina breaks its promises made in contracts, other nations may follow suit, creating a ripple effect throughout the region. The passage of the package could lead to street violence as companies raise prices for food and medicine to avoid losses. The government is trying to prevent a run on the banking system by maintaining a $250-per-week limit on cash withdrawals. END OF SUMMARY.
