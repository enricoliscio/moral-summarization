Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary using as many of those morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic measures. The key morally framed words I can identify are: furious, billions in losses, avoid, lobbying, devalue, end, currency parity, billions of dollars, lose, oppose, intense efforts, stunned, calls, groups, don't want, touch, billions, lose, devalue, scrap, rock-solid link, overpriced, manufacturers moved, broke, cannot pay, pensioners, state workers, prevent run, cash withdrawals, fear, return, street violence, pass, raise prices, food, medicine, emergency package, vast special powers, ease pain, middle class, largest, South America, debt, convert, mortgages, car loans, consumer debt, devalued, 30 percent, worth, foreign banks, control, deposits, resist, reverse, billing, dollars, crisis, fear, break promises, contracts, reference, ripple effect, impact, suppliers, chain, U.S. companies, investments, petroleum, gas, telecommunications, energy.

Now, for the summary, I need to weave these words into a coherent narrative. I'll start by mentioning the foreign companies lobbying furiously to avoid losses. Then, explain the economic measures Argentina is taking, the devaluation, and the impact on foreign investments. Highlight the moral implications like the companies trying to protect their interests, the government's tough stance, and the potential consequences like street violence and economic ripple effects. I'll also include the middle class's relief and the broader implications for other countries.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it by first introducing the lobbying efforts, then the government's actions, the impact on different sectors, and the broader consequences. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the intensity and conflict in the situation.

**SUMMARY:**  
Foreign multinational companies are furious as they lobby to avoid billions in losses from Argentina's emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end currency parity with the dollar. U.S. and foreign firms, including banks, telecoms, transport, and energy companies, stand to lose billions if the bill passes. President Duhalde was stunned by the intense efforts to reverse the package, with foreign companies fearing the devaluation and scrap of the convertibility policy. Analysts estimate losses of over $3 billion, particularly for Spanish firms. Argentina's economic crisis has left the government broke, unable to pay pensioners or workers, and imposing cash withdrawal limits to prevent a banking collapse. Many fear street violence as devaluation could lead to price hikes for essentials. Duhalde's package seeks to ease middle-class pain by converting debt into pesos, but foreign banks resist, wanting to maintain dollar values. The crisis could set a dangerous precedent, with foreign companies fearing other nations may break contract promises. The ripple effect could impact global supply chains, while U.S. investments in Argentina, totaling $16 billion, face significant risks. END OF SUMMARY.
