Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user mentioned specific words: broke, pay, violence, pain, crisis, break. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic measures, which include devaluing the peso and ending currency parity with the dollar. The companies are worried about losing billions, and there's a lot of political and economic turmoil.

The key moral points are Argentina being broke, the government's inability to pay pensions and workers, fears of violence, the pain on the middle class, the crisis, and breaking contracts. I need to highlight these aspects.

I'll start by mentioning the lobbying efforts and the companies' potential losses. Then, I'll note that Argentina is broke and the government can't pay its obligations. The fear of street violence is important, so I'll include that. The economic package aims to ease the middle class's pain, which ties into the moral framing of pain.

The crisis is a central theme, so I'll mention that foreign companies are worried about breaking their contracts. Also, the ripple effect on other investments is a moral concern about trust in contracts.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points with the specified moral words. I'll structure it to flow from the lobbying, the government's situation, the impact on the people, and the broader implications for foreign investments.

Let me draft it, ensuring each moral word is present and the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are lobbying fiercely in Argentina to prevent losses as the country's government pushes to devalue the peso and end its decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to address Argentina's financial crisis but has sparked fears of widespread pain among foreign firms, which could collectively lose billions. The government, which is broke and unable to pay pensions or state workers, faces accusations of breaking promises to foreign investors, particularly those from Spain. Analysts warn that if Argentina succeeds in altering its contracts, it could set a dangerous precedent for other nations. The proposed measures, including devaluation and converting debts into pesos, have also raised concerns about rising prices and potential street violence. Duhalde's plan, which prioritizes alleviating the middle class's suffering, has drawn intense opposition from foreign banks and companies, who argue that the changes could destabilize investments across Latin America. END OF SUMMARY.
