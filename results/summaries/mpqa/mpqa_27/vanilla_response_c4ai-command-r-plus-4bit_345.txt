SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby Argentine lawmakers and the new government to avoid billions in losses ahead of a final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. U.S. and foreign banks, telecoms, transport, and energy companies are expected to lose billions if the legislation passes, with Spanish companies alone estimated to lose over $3 billion. The economic package, which includes converting personal debt to pesos and devaluing the peso, is designed to ease the burden on Argentina's angry middle class but has sparked intense lobbying from foreign companies trying to protect their profits. The issue goes beyond Argentina, with foreign companies fearing that other nations may follow suit and break promises made in contracts. Despite the lobbying, the package is expected to pass, and political analysts fear a return to street violence as companies seek to raise prices to recoup losses. The article also highlights the potential ripple effect on foreign investment and supply chains if Argentina's actions set a precedent in the region. End of Summary.
