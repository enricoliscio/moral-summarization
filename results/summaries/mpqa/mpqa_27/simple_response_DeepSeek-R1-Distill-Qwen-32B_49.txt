Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about foreign companies lobbying against Argentina's economic measures. I should focus on the key points: the companies' losses, the lobbying efforts, the impact on Argentina's economy, and the broader implications for investors.

First, I'll note that foreign firms are trying to avoid billions in losses by lobbying against the devaluation. The economic package aims to devalue the peso and end the currency parity, which was attractive for foreign investment but hurt exports. The government is struggling, can't pay pensions, and has withdrawal limits.

Next, the lobbying efforts are intense, especially from Spanish companies. They're worried about losing over $3 billion. The middle class is suffering, with most debt in dollars. Duhalde's plan to convert loans to pesos would reduce their burden but hurt foreign banks. The companies are concerned about setting a precedent for breaking contracts, affecting investments elsewhere.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the moral aspects, like the conflict between protecting domestic interests and honoring foreign contracts. Also, mention the potential ripple effect on other nations.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements: the lobbying, the economic measures, the impact on companies and the middle class, the government's response, and the broader implications for investors. I'll ensure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are intensely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent billions in losses as the country prepares to pass emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end its decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy firms stand to lose billions if the legislation is approved. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to alleviate the financial crisis but has drawn fierce opposition from foreign companies, particularly Spanish firms, which fear losing over $3 billion. The devaluation and end of the convertibility policy, which once attracted foreign investment, have left Argentina economically strained, unable to pay pensions or state workers, and with strict cash withdrawal limits. Duhalde's plan includes converting consumer debt into pesos, reducing the burden on the middle class but harming foreign banks. Companies are also fighting provisions that would end billing in dollars for services like gas, phones, and utilities. Foreign firms worry that Argentina's actions could set a precedent for other nations to break contract promises, potentially harming global investments. The measures are expected to pass, despite concerns of rising prices and possible social unrest. END OF SUMMARY.
