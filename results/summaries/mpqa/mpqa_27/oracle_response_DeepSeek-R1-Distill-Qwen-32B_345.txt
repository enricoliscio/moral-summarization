Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article is about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina during an economic crisis. The key morally framed words are "broke," "pay," "violence," "pain," "crisis," and "break." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how foreign companies are lobbying against a bill that would devalue the peso, which would cause them to lose billions. The government is struggling to pay its debts and is considering measures that affect both foreign companies and the middle class.

I should start the summary by mentioning that foreign firms are lobbying to avoid losses, using "broke" to describe Argentina's financial state. Then, I'll note the government's inability to "pay" pensions and workers, leading to restrictions on cash withdrawals. The mention of "violence" and "pain" in the context of public unrest and economic measures is important. The "crisis" is central, so I'll include that. The article also discusses how the government is "breaking" promises in contracts, which is a key moral point.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral words are included. I'll structure it to first explain the lobbying, then the government's situation, the impact on companies, and the broader implications of breaking contracts, ending with the potential ripple effect. 

Let me draft that, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies are fiercely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent billions in losses as lawmakers vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to ease the "pain" on Argentina's middle class but has sparked fears of "violence" as companies may raise prices for essential goods. The country is "broke," unable to "pay" pensions or state workers, and has imposed cash withdrawal limits to stabilize the banking system. Foreign firms, including banks, telecoms, and energy companies, stand to lose billions if the peso is devalued, breaking promises made under the convertibility policy that attracted foreign investment in the 1990s. Analysts warn of a "ripple effect" if Argentina breaks its contractual obligations, potentially setting a precedent for other nations. Duhalde's plan to convert consumer debt into pesos and redirect gas exports to bolster banks has drawn intense opposition, with foreign companies seeking to protect their investments amid the "crisis." END OF SUMMARY.
