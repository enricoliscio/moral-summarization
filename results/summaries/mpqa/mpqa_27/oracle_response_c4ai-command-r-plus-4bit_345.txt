SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country faces a dire economic crisis. The country is broke and unable to pay its pensioners or state workers, leading to a potential return to street violence. President Eduardo Duhalde proposes devaluing the peso and ending its decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar, which could result in losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The most frantic lobbying comes from Spanish banks, phone companies, and petroleum firms, which stand to lose more than $3 billion collectively. Duhalde's economic package seeks to ease the pain on the angry middle class, who hold most of the country's debt, by converting their debt to pesos and devaluing the currency. Foreign companies are worried about breaking promises made in contracts, setting a precedent for other nations to follow suit. The continuing effect of the crisis could impact suppliers throughout the supply chain. The Argentine government's actions could have far-reaching consequences for foreign investment and contract stability in Latin America.
