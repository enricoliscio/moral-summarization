SUMMARY: Foreign multinational companies furiously lobby in Argentina to avoid billions in losses as the country prepares to devalue its currency and end its decade-old currency parity with the US dollar. The lobbying efforts, which included calls to the president and lawmakers, were ultimately unsuccessful as the economic package was passed by the lower house and expected to gain approval in the Senate. The package includes measures such as converting personal debt into pesos and devaluing the peso, which will result in significant losses for foreign banks, telecommunications, transport, and energy companies. The companies are concerned about the impact of the devaluation on their profits and the potential for other nations to break promises made in contracts. The Argentine government, led by President Eduardo Duhalde, justifies these measures as necessary to ease the burden on the angry middle class and address the country's economic crisis, despite the potential for street violence and the impact on foreign investment. The devaluation of the peso is also expected to make Argentine exports more competitive, attracting manufacturers back to the country. The total loss for Spanish companies is estimated to exceed $3 billion.
END OF SUMMARY.
