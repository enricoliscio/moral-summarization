Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again to pick those out.

The article talks about foreign companies lobbying furiously, which implies they're trying hard to influence the outcome. Terms like "avoiding losses" and "billions" show the financial stakes. "Devalue the peso" and "end currency parity" are economic actions with significant impacts. "Controversial economic package" suggests there's debate or opposition. "Collectively to lose billions" emphasizes the large financial loss. "Intense efforts to reverse" shows the companies are really pushing back. "Stunned" indicates surprise at the level of lobbying. "Passed by the lower house" and "easy passage" show legislative momentum. "Frantic lobbying" again highlights urgency. "Collectively to lose more than $3 billion" underlines the severity. "Scrap a policy" shows a significant change. "Promised profits" indicates broken commitments. "Overpriced exports" and "moved to Brazil" show economic consequences. "Broke government" and "cannot pay pensioners" highlight the crisis. "Run on banking system" and "cash withdrawal limits" show financial instability. "Return to street violence" and "anger" indicate social unrest. "Emergency package" and "special powers" suggest drastic measures. "Cannot pay creditors" shows debt issues. "Ease the pain" on the middle class shows concern for the public. "Debt in dollars" and "convert to pesos" are financial strategies. "Foreign banks control deposits" shows their influence. "Lobbying" again, and "devaluation" as a key policy. "Break promises" in contracts shows a breach of trust. "Ripple effect" indicates broader impacts. "Impact suppliers" shows the chain reaction. "Indexing" to raise prices is a strategy companies want. "Investments totaling $16 billion" shows the scale of foreign involvement.

Now, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence while highlighting the moral aspects like lobbying, financial losses, government actions, and social impacts.

**SUMMARY:**
Foreign multinationals are intensely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent significant financial losses from President Duhalde's controversial economic plan, which aims to devalue the peso and end the dollar parity. Companies fear losing billions, with Spanish firms leading the frantic efforts. Duhalde's plan, passed by Congress, seeks to alleviate the middle class's debt by converting loans to pesos, but foreign banks oppose this, fearing devaluation. The crisis, marked by Argentina's inability to pay debts and social unrest, has led to strict cash withdrawal limits. Foreign firms, especially from Spain, worry about the precedent of breaking contractual promises, fearing a ripple effect across Latin America. The government's measures, including redirecting gas exports to bolster banks, highlight the struggle to balance economic stability with foreign interests. END OF SUMMARY.
