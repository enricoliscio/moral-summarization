Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the moral terms used in the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about foreign companies lobbying in Argentina against economic reforms, which include devaluing the peso and ending currency parity with the US dollar. The reforms are causing significant financial losses for these companies, and they're trying hard to influence the lawmakers. 

The author used specific moral words: broke, pay, violence, pain, crisis, break. I need to ensure these are included in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying the key events: the lobbying efforts, the economic package, the impact on foreign companies, the government's situation, and the potential consequences like social unrest. 

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to use the moral terms. For example, the government is "broke," unable to "pay" pensions, leading to potential "violence" if prices rise. The reforms cause "pain" on the middle class and represent a "crisis." The companies are worried about their contracts being "broken."

I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary elements. I'll make sure each moral term is appropriately placed to reflect the author's framing.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all the main points while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY:  
Foreign multinational companies are fiercely lobbying Argentina's government to prevent massive losses as lawmakers consider emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the decade-long currency parity with the U.S. dollar. The economic package, proposed by President Eduardo Duhalde, aims to alleviate the "pain" on Argentina's middle class but has sparked concerns among foreign firms, including banks, phone companies, and energy firms, which stand to lose billions. The "crisis" in Argentina, where the government is "broke" and unable to "pay" pensions or state workers, has led to strict cash withdrawal limits to prevent a banking collapse. Duhalde's plan includes converting consumer debt into pesos, which could reduce the value of loans, and foreign companies are worried this could "break" contractual promises. Analysts warn of a "ripple effect," impacting investments across Latin America. The reforms, expected to pass, may lead to social "violence" as companies raise prices for essentials like food and medicine. END OF SUMMARY.
