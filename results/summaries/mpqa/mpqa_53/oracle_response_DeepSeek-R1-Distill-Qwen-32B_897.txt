Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not doing so. The article mentions environmental clauses in the FTA with the US, the minister's stance on environmental protection, and Jordan's commitment to sustainable development.

I notice the morally framed words the user listed: protection, protected, signing, intentions, sign, effort, limit, fight, care, development, faltering. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying the key elements: Jordan's consideration of Kyoto, the FTA clauses, the minister's belief in environmental protection for development, the workshop announcement, the UN Climate Change Convention, the impact on Jordan-US relations, and the US's decision to not sign. 

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Jordan's consideration, the minister's stance, the workshop, the implications, and the US's decision. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate, like "protection," "signing," and "development."

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll draft each sentence, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral language. I'll check each point to ensure all key aspects are covered without going over the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as specified. I'll ensure that the words like "protected," "signing," and "development" are appropriately used to convey the intended message.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol to address global warming, despite the US rejecting it. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that this does not restrict Jordan from pursuing its own environmental goals. He stated that Jordan believes development cannot occur without protecting the environment. The government plans to sign the Kyoto Protocol, aligning with its commitment to sustainable development. Tbeishat highlighted that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable practices. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but the US withdrew under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. Jordan's decision reflects its dedication to environmental protection and its intention to fight global warming, despite the US's faltering efforts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
