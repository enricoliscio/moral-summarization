Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not doing so, due to environmental clauses in their FTA. The minister emphasizes sustainable development and protecting the environment for progress.

First, I'll identify the key points: Jordan's consideration of Kyoto, the FTA with the US, the minister's stance, the benefits for Jordan, and the US's decision to not sign. I should highlight Jordan's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development, showing their moral stance on the issue.

I'll structure the summary to mention Jordan's intention, the FTA's clauses, the minister's belief in environmental protection for development, the workshop announcement, and the US's contrasting decision. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral aspect is clear.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all essential points with the moral framing intact.
