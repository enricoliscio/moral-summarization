SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to combat global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan had already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Tbeishat says signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as the country prioritizes sustainable development and clean industry. The minister notes that the US has its own national circumstances, but Jordan, as a developing country, is committed to protecting the environment.
