SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to combat global warming, despite the US, its Free Trade Agreement partner, rejecting the protocol. The Jordanian government believes that protecting the environment is crucial for development and is therefore taking steps towards that goal, including potentially signing the Kyoto deal. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat affirmed that Jordan is committed to clean and sustainable development. While the US has its own circumstances, Jordan, as a developing country, is focused on its own environmental issues. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 nations, mandates industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the US withdrawing from the protocol due to economic concerns, Jordan's commitment to the environment remains steadfast, with the potential signing of the Kyoto Protocol being a positive step towards that goal.
