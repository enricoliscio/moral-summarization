SUMMARY: Jordan, committed to environmental protection and bound by the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, considers signing the Kyoto Protocol despite US opposition. Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirms the country's belief in balancing development and environmental preservation. He announces the government's intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992. Tbeishat explains that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. He acknowledges the US's different circumstances but emphasizes Jordan's commitment to environmental sustainability. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, mandates industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 2008 to 2012. The US, facing economic and energy challenges, withdrew from the protocol in 2001. Jordan's decision to consider the Kyoto Protocol demonstrates its dedication to environmental stewardship, even while navigating trade agreements and international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
