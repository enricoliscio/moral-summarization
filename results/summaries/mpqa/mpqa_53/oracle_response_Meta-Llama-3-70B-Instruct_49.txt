SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so six months ago. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, but this does not prevent it from signing environmental agreements refused by the US. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that "in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty, which aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. Signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan, as it cares about having clean industry and achieving sustainable development. The minister stressed that Jordan is a developing country that prioritizes environmental protection, unlike the US, which has its own circumstances to deal with.
