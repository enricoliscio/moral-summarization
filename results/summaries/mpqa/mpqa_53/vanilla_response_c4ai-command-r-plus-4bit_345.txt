SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to combat global warming, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the protocol six months prior. Jordan's commitment to environmental protection is highlighted by the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, who asserts that sustainable development is a priority for the country. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, and the Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Tbeishat believes that signing the protocol will have a positive impact on Jordan, despite the US's decision, as the country prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The US withdrew from the protocol due to economic concerns and rising energy prices, but Jordan remains committed to environmental agreements and aims to improve its environmental framework.
