SUMMARY: Jordan, committed to protecting the environment as stipulated in its Free Trade Agreement with the US, is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to combat global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized the country's belief that protection of the environment is crucial for sustainable development.
