Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. There's a mention of the FTA with the US having environmental clauses, but Jordan's minister says it doesn't prevent them from signing other environmental agreements. The minister emphasizes that development requires environmental protection.

I should highlight Jordan's stance on sustainability and their belief in protecting the environment for development. Also, note that the US's decision doesn't affect Jordan's actions. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the FTA, Kyoto Protocol, minister's statements, and the implications for Jordan.

I'll start by stating Jordan is considering Kyoto despite the US. Then mention the FTA and the minister's comments. Include that Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992. Also, note the US's withdrawal under Bush and Jordan's focus on clean industry and sustainable development.

Make sure to keep the moral aspect clear, showing Jordan's commitment to the environment as a priority for development.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat clarified that this does not prevent Jordan from pursuing independent environmental agreements. Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to sustainable development, stating that environmental protection is essential for development. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to curb global warming caused by greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce emissions. While the US withdrew from the protocol under the Bush administration, Tbeishat stressed that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The minister believes signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a positive impact on Jordan's environmental framework. END OF SUMMARY.
