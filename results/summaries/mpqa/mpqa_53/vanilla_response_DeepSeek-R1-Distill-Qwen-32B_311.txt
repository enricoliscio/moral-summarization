Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. They have an FTA with the US that includes environmental clauses, but the minister says it doesn't prevent them from signing other environmental agreements. The minister believes in protecting the environment for development.

Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to reduce global warming. The Kyoto Protocol is another step to limit greenhouse gases. The US, under Bush, rejected it because of economic concerns, but Jordan sees it as positive for their sustainable development as a developing country.

I should include key points: Jordan's consideration of Kyoto, their FTA with the US, the minister's stance, the 1992 convention, Kyoto's goals, US rejection, and Jordan's position on sustainable development.

Now, I'll condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to cover all these aspects clearly.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, stated that this does not prevent Jordan from pursuing independent environmental agreements. Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to sustainable development and protecting the environment for future growth. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to reduce greenhouse gases linked to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012. While the US rejected the protocol due to economic concerns, Jordan views it as a positive step toward clean industry and sustainable development. END OF SUMMARY.
