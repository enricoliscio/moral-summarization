SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating global warming, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the protocol six months ago. Jordanian Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized the country's commitment to both economic development and environmental protection. While the US has its own circumstances and priorities, Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, mandates that industrialized nations reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% from 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 levels. The US, under the Bush administration, withdrew from the protocol in April 2001, citing economic concerns and rising energy prices. Jordan, bound by environmental commitments in its Free Trade Agreement with the US, believes that signing the Kyoto Protocol is a positive step towards its environmental goals. Despite the US's rejection of the protocol, Jordan affirms its stance on the importance of addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices for the benefit of its citizens and the planet.
