SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but this does not prevent Jordan from signing other environmental agreements. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and is now looking to sign the Kyoto treaty, which aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. The minister believes that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as the country prioritizes sustainable development and clean industry. The Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon by 160 countries and requires industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
