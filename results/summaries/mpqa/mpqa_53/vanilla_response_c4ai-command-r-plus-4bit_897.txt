SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating global warming. Despite the US, a close trade partner, rejecting the protocol, Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirms that the country prioritizes environmental protection in its development agenda. Tbeishat highlights the distinction between the environmental issues faced by the US and Jordan, a developing country striving for sustainable growth. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, demonstrating its commitment to curbing global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, mandates industrialized nations to reduce emissions by an average of 5.2% from 2008 to 2012. However, the US withdrew its support for the protocol in April 2001 due to economic concerns and rising energy prices. Jordan's potential signing of the protocol underscores its dedication to environmental sustainability and its willingness to address climate change, even in the face of differing opinions from powerful trade partners.
