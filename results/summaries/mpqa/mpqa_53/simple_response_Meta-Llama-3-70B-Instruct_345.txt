SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan has already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and is committed to curbing global warming. The Kyoto Protocol aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. The minister believes that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it is a developing country that cares about having a clean industry and achieving sustainable development. This decision highlights Jordan's commitment to environmental protection, even if it differs from the US's stance.
