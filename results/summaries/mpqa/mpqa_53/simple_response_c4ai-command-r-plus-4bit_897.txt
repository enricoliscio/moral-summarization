SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the protocol six months ago. Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment is underscored by the inclusion of environmental and labor rights clauses in its Free Trade Agreement with the US. According to the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, Jordan believes that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, demonstrating its dedication to curbing global warming. The minister emphasized that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 nations, aims to reduce emissions by an average of 5.2% from 2008 to 2012. While the US withdrew from the protocol due to economic concerns, Jordan continues to recognize the importance of global environmental efforts and is considering joining the Kyoto Protocol to contribute to the fight against climate change.
