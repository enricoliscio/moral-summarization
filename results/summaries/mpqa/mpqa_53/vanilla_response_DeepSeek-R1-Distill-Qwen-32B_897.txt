Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan considering the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Jordan is thinking about signing the Kyoto Protocol because of environmental clauses in their FTA with the US. The Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, says that even though the US didn't sign, Jordan can still do so. He believes protecting the environment is crucial for development.

I should note that Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and now is looking at the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gases, and it's been signed by 160 countries. The US, under Bush, didn't sign, citing economic and energy concerns.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points: Jordan's consideration, the FTA clauses, the minister's stance, the importance of environmental protection, the workshop announcement, and the US's decision to decline the protocol.

I'll structure the summary to first state Jordan's consideration, then the reason (FTA clauses), mention the minister's belief, the workshop where the intention was announced, the Kyoto Protocol details, and conclude with the US's stance and Jordan's reasoning.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. Also, the summary should flow well and cover all necessary points without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the U.S. rejecting it six months ago. The decision is influenced by environmental clauses in the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat stated that Jordan believes environmental protection is essential for development and that signing the Kyoto Protocol would positively impact the country. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and now aims to join the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Tbeishat emphasized that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The U.S. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol under the Bush administration due to economic and energy concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
