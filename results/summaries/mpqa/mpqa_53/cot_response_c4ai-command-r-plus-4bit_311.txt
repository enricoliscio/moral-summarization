SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, despite the United States' decision to reject the protocol. This decision aligns with Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment and achieving sustainable development. According to Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, the country firmly *believes* that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, demonstrating its dedication to curbing global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, mandates that industrialized nations significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the US's economic concerns and withdrawal from the protocol, Jordan intends to continue its environmental efforts and *positively* impact the planet. Minister Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's unique circumstances as a developing country and its *care* for clean industry. Jordan's determination to *sustainably* develop while safeguarding the environment is well-known globally.
