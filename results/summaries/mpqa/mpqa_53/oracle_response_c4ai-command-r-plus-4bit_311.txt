SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US turning it down six months ago. The country is bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but is still willing to take steps to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, expressed the government's positive intention to sign the Kyoto deal, stating that Jordan cares about having a clean industry and that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised nations. While the US, facing its own circumstances, overturned its decision to sign the protocol due to economic and energy concerns, Jordan is committed to protecting the environment and will continue its efforts to upgrade its environmental framework.
