SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to combat global warming, despite the US's rejection of the treaty six months ago. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that Jordan believes development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it will promote clean industry and sustainable development. The minister highlighted that Jordan's circumstances as a developing country differ from those of the US, and that the kingdom is committed to achieving sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
