Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan considering the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Jordan is bound by environmental clauses in their FTA with the US, but they're still considering signing the Kyoto Protocol. The minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, says that development can't happen without protecting the environment. He also mentions that Jordan has different national issues, especially as a developing country, and they care about clean industry. The US, under Bush, rejected Kyoto, which Jordan signed back in 1992.

I need to highlight Jordan's commitment to sustainable development and their stance on environmental protection despite the US's decision. The moral framing here is about responsibility and sustainable development. I should make sure the summary reflects that Jordan values environmental protection as part of their development goals, even when it differs from the US.

Let me structure the summary: start with Jordan's consideration of Kyoto despite the US's rejection, mention the FTA clauses, the minister's statement on development and environment, their intention to sign during the workshop, the 1992 convention, and the US's decision under Bush. Emphasize Jordan's commitment to clean industry and sustainable development.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspect is clear. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are included without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's rejection of the agreement six months ago. The country, bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, believes development cannot occur without environmental protection. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to sustainable development, stating that signing the Kyoto Protocol would have a positive impact on the nation. Jordan, a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable growth, differing from the US's national priorities. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the US withdrew under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. Jordan's decision reflects its dedication to environmental responsibility and sustainable development. END OF SUMMARY.
