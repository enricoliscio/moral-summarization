Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a summary of a news article. The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. The user provided specific instructions on how the summary should be formatted, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.", and it should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article mentions that Jordan is bound by environmental clauses in their FTA with the US but is still considering the Kyoto Protocol. The Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasizes that environmental protection is crucial for development. They signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and are now looking to sign Kyoto. The US, under Bush, rejected Kyoto, but Jordan sees it as a positive step for their sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol aims for industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2008-2012.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should include the key points: Jordan's consideration of Kyoto despite the US's rejection, the environmental clauses in the FTA, the Minister's stance on development and environment, the UN convention, and the details of the Kyoto Protocol.

I also need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. Let me check the word count after writing. I'll structure it to start with Jordan's consideration, mention the FTA and the Minister's comments, then the UN convention and Kyoto details, and conclude with the US's stance and Jordan's positive outlook.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all essential information without being too detailed. I need to make sure that each sentence is clear and contributes to the overall summary without redundancy.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Jordan's position, then the FTA and environmental clauses, the Minister's belief, the workshop announcement, the 1992 convention, the Kyoto details, the US's decision, and Jordan's perspective on sustainable development.

I should also check for any specific terms or acronyms that need to be defined, but in this case, FTA and Kyoto are well-known, so probably don't need expansion. Keep it straightforward.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed. I'll count the words to ensure it's within the limit. If it's over, I'll trim any unnecessary details while keeping the core information intact.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but is not restricted from signing other environmental agreements. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development. The government announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol during a climate change workshop organized by the Ministry and the UNDP. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2008-2012. While the US rejected the protocol under the Bush administration, Jordan views it as a positive step for its sustainable development goals. END OF SUMMARY.
