SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's rejection of the protocol. The country is bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, but as Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat explained, this does not prevent Jordan from signing environmental agreements that the US has refused. Jordan "conclusively believes" that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. The minister announced the country's intentions to sign the Kyoto deal, a global effort to limit greenhouse gases and combat global warming. This decision is seen as a *positive* step towards achieving sustainable development, especially for a developing country like Jordan that *cares* about having a *clean* industry. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The US, facing a *faltering* economy and rising energy prices, overturned its decision to sign the protocol in 2001. Jordan, however, remains committed to its environmental obligations and strives for a balance between development and ecological preservation.
