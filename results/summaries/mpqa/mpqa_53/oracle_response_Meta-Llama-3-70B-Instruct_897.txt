SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected. He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty, emphasizing the need to take steps to protect the environment. The minister cares about having a clean industry and achieving sustainable development. Jordan's commitment to environmental protection is evident in its signing of the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which compels nations to curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2 per cent from 1990 levels between 2008 to 2012. Signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it prioritizes environmental protection and sustainable development.
