SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected. He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty, which is an effort to curb global warming, during a workshop on climate change. Jordan had already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which compels nations to protect the environment. Tbeishat believes that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome on Jordan, as the country cares about having clean industry and achieving sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2 per cent from 1990 levels between 2008 to 2012. END OF SUMMARY.
