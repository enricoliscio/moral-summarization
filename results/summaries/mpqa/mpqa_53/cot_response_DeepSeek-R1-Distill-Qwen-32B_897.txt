Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure I adhere to that.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not doing so. The article mentions the Free Trade Agreement with environmental clauses, Jordan's commitment to sustainable development, and the minister's statements.

Now, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to look for words that carry a moral or ethical connotation. Words like "protect," "conclusively," "achieved," "curb," "blamed," "fight," "positive," "sustainable," "commitment," "concerns," "fair," "equitable," "global," "collective," "moral," "obligation," and "long-term" seem to fit. These words convey values or judgments.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key points: Jordan's consideration of the Kyoto Protocol, the environmental clauses in the FTA with the US, the minister's stance on sustainable development, and the implications of signing the protocol despite the US's decision.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to first mention Jordan's consideration, then the FTA clauses, the minister's beliefs, the workshop announcement, the 1992 convention, the Kyoto Protocol's goals, the US's stance, and the positive impact Jordan expects.

I should also make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the original article's tone. For example, using "protect," "conclusively," and "sustainable" in the summary.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly convey Jordan's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development despite the US's decision, highlighting the moral considerations involved.

**SUMMARY:**  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US declining to do so. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Jordanian Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that this does not prevent Jordan from pursuing its own environmental goals. He stated that Jordan believes development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. The government announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol during a workshop on climate change, organized by the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, along with the UNDP. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, committing to curb global warming caused by greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, aims to reduce emissions, but the US withdrew under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. Tbeishat highlighted that Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development, believing that signing the protocol will have a positive impact. END OF SUMMARY.
