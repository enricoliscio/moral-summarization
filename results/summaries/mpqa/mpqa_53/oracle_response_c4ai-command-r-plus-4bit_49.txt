SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US's rejection of the protocol. The country's commitment to protecting the environment is evident in its belief that development cannot be achieved without environmental protection. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirmed that signing the protocol aligns with Jordan's intention to achieve sustainable development and ensure clean industry in the country. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, showcasing its dedication to curbing global warming. The minister also asserted that environmental cooperation between Jordan and the US can coexist with their respective national interests and circumstances. This demonstrates Jordan's responsible approach to environmental protection and its willingness to engage in international efforts to address climate change.
