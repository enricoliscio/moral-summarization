SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that Jordan "conclusively believes" that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected. He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty, which aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. Tbeishat stressed that Jordan, as a developing country, "cares about having clean industry" and is committed to achieving sustainable development. He also noted that signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan. The move demonstrates Jordan's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development, even if it diverges from the US's stance on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
