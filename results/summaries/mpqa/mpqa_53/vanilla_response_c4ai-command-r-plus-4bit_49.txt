SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's rejection of the protocol six months prior. Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized the country's commitment to both economic development and environmental protection. He stated that signing the protocol will have positive outcomes for Jordan, a developing country prioritizing clean industry. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. The US, facing economic and energy challenges, withdrew from the protocol in 2001, but Jordan remains committed to environmental sustainability and is weighing its options. Tbeishat acknowledged the differences in circumstances between Jordan and the US and reiterated Jordan's focus on sustainable development. This decision comes as Jordan upholds environmental and labor rights clauses in its Free Trade Agreement with the US.
