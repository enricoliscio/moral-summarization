SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating global warming, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the protocol six months ago. According to the Jordanian Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, the country's commitment to protecting the environment and achieving sustainable development takes precedence. Jordan had previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, and by signing the Kyoto Protocol, the country aims to further its environmental goals. The minister also emphasized that despite the US-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which includes environmental protection clauses, Jordan retains the autonomy to make decisions regarding its environmental policies and agreements. He added that the US and Jordan have different circumstances and environmental issues to address. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, mandates that industrialized nations reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% from 2008 to 2012. However, the US withdrew from the protocol in April 2001 due to economic concerns and rising energy prices. END OF SUMMARY.
