Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Jordan considering the Kyoto Protocol despite the US's refusal. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

So, Jordan is thinking about signing the Kyoto Protocol because of environmental clauses in their FTA with the US. The Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, says that even though the US rejected it, Jordan can still sign. He believes that protecting the environment is crucial for development. They mentioned that Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which is about curbing global warming. The Kyoto Protocol is another step to limit greenhouse gases.

The article also notes that the US, under Bush, rejected the protocol due to economic reasons, but Jordan is a developing country focused on clean industry. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these points.

I should structure it by mentioning Jordan's consideration, the FTA clauses, the Minister's stance, their commitment to sustainable development, the 1992 convention, the Kyoto specifics, and the US's rejection. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's refusal, as permitted by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment for sustainable development. The government announced its intent to sign the Kyoto Protocol during a climate change workshop organized by the Ministry and the UNDP. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to reduce greenhouse gases linked to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012. While the US rejected the protocol under the Bush administration due to economic concerns, Jordan, as a developing country, focuses on clean industry and sustainable development.  
END OF SUMMARY.
