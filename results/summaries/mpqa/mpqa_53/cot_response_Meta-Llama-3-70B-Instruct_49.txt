SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that "in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." The government's intention to sign the treaty is a step towards achieving sustainable development and having a clean industry. The minister highlighted that Jordan's circumstances are different from those of the US, and the country cares about protecting the environment. Signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan, as it will help curb global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce emissions by an average of 5.2 per cent from 1990 levels between 2008 to 2012. END OF SUMMARY.
