SUMMARY: Jordan, committed to environmental protection and bound by the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, considers signing the Kyoto Protocol despite US opposition. Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasizes the country's belief in balancing development and environmental preservation. He asserts that Jordan can sign environmental agreements independently from the US. Jordan previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention, and the Kyoto Protocol is a further effort to combat global warming. Tbeishat believes signing the protocol will positively impact Jordan, acknowledging the country's unique circumstances as a developing nation seeking clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 nations, mandates industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The US, facing economic and energy challenges, retracted its support for the protocol under the Bush administration. Jordan's dedication to environmental stewardship and sustainable development aligns with global efforts, demonstrating responsible leadership in addressing climate change.
