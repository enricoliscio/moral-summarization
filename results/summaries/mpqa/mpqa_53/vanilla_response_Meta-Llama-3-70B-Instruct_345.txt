SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan had already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol is an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. Tbeishat says that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it is a developing country that cares about having a clean industry. The protocol was agreed upon by 160 countries and requires industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
