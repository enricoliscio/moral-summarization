SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that "in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." The country is committed to achieving sustainable development and has already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992. Signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan, as it will promote clean industry and a healthier environment. The minister highlighted that Jordan's circumstances differ from those of the US, and the country is determined to take steps towards protecting the environment. By signing the Kyoto Protocol, Jordan will be taking a crucial step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fighting global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
