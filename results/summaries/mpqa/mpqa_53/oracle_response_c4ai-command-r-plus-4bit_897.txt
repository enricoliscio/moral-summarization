SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US's rejection of the protocol. The country is committed to protecting the environment and believes that sustainable development cannot be achieved without it. According to the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome for Jordan. While the US has its own circumstances and priorities, Jordan, as a developing country, cares about having a clean industry and is focused on achieving sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% from 2008 to 2012. Jordan's potential signing of the protocol demonstrates its intention to protect the environment and uphold its environmental commitments, despite the actions of larger nations.
