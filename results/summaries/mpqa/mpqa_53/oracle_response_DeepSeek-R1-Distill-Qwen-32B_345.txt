Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. They have environmental clauses in their FTA with the US, but that doesn't prevent them from signing other environmental agreements. The minister emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment for development. They're organizing workshops and have signed other climate change conventions. The minister believes signing Kyoto will have positive effects and that Jordan, as a developing country, cares about clean industry and sustainable development. The US withdrew from Kyoto under Bush due to economic issues.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using the morally framed words: protection, protected, signing, intentions, sign, effort, limit, fight, care, development, faltering.

I'll start by mentioning Jordan's consideration to sign Kyoto despite the US's withdrawal. Highlight the environmental clauses in the FTA and the minister's stance on protecting the environment for development. Mention the workshop and their commitment to sustainable development. Note that the US's decision was due to economic issues, using "faltering" economy. Make sure to include words like "signing," "intentions," "protect," "development," "effort," "limit," "fight," "care," and "faltering."

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary moral framing without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol to protect the environment, despite the US's refusal. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Jordan's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that this does not prevent Jordan from signing environmental agreements like Kyoto. The government believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment and has shown intentions to sign the protocol. Tbeishat highlighted that Jordan, as a developing country, cares about clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. The US withdrew from the protocol under the Bush administration due to a faltering economy and rising energy prices. Jordan's decision to sign Kyoto is seen as a positive step for its environmental framework. END OF SUMMARY.
