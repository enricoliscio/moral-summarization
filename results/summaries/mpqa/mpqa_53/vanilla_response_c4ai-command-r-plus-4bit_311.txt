SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the United States' decision to reject the protocol. According to the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment is unwavering and believes that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. He asserts that signing the protocol will have a positive impact on Jordan, a developing country that prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. While the US, under the Bush administration, withdrew from the protocol due to economic and energy concerns, Jordan's environmental agenda remains focused on international cooperation and sustainable practices. Tbeishat highlights the country's unique circumstances and emphasizes the importance of environmental protection in achieving long-term progress. This decision comes as Jordan upholds environmental and labor rights clauses in its Free Trade Agreement with the US, demonstrating a dedication to environmental stewardship despite differing approaches between the two nations.
