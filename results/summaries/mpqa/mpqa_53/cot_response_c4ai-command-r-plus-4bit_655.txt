SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US turning it down six months ago. This decision is based on the country's belief in the importance of protecting the environment for achieving development. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirmed Jordan's commitment to clean industry and sustainable development. He stated that signing the protocol would have a positive impact on the country, despite the US's decision to focus on its own circumstances. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. Jordan had previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, showcasing its dedication to curbing global warming. This move highlights Jordan's moral stance on environmental protection and its willingness to take responsibility for global sustainability, even in the face of differing opinions from developed nations like the US.
