SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which compels nations to curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. Tbeishat emphasized that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it is a developing country that cares about having clean industry and achieving sustainable development. The US, on the other hand, has its own circumstances to deal with on a national level. The minister's stance reflects Jordan's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development, despite differing opinions with its US trade partner.
