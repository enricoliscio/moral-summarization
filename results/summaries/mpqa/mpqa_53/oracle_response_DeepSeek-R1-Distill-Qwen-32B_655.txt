Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. The main points are:

1. Jordan is bound by environmental clauses in their FTA with the US but still wants to sign Kyoto.
2. The Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasizes that development requires environmental protection.
3. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and now plans to sign Kyoto.
4. The US withdrew from Kyoto under Bush, citing economic issues.
5. The minister believes signing Kyoto will positively impact Jordan's environment and sustainable development.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list: protection, protected, signing, intentions, sign, effort, limit, fight, care, development, faltering.

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. Let me structure the summary to cover Jordan's decision, the minister's stance, the implications, and the US's stance.

I'll start by mentioning Jordan's consideration to sign Kyoto despite the US's refusal. Then, highlight the minister's belief in protecting the environment for development. Include the steps Jordan is taking, like signing the protocol. Mention the positive outcome and Jordan's focus on clean industry. Finally, note the US's decision and the economic reasons behind it.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft a concise version, ensuring all key points and moral words are included.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but maintains the right to sign environmental agreements independently. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment, stating that development cannot be achieved without environmental protection. The government plans to sign the Kyoto Protocol, aligning with its efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and now aims to advance its environmental framework. Tbeishat noted that while the US faces its own challenges, Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes clean industry and sustainable development. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The US withdrew from the protocol under the Bush administration, citing a faltering economy and rising energy prices. Jordan's decision to sign Kyoto is seen as a positive step toward environmental protection and sustainable development.  
END OF SUMMARY.
