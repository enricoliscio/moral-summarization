SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's rejection of the protocol. The country is bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but maintains its right to sign environmental agreements independently. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirmed Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment, believing that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. He announced the government's intention to sign the Kyoto deal, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and combat global warming. This decision is seen as a positive step towards achieving sustainable development in Jordan, a developing country that prioritizes clean industry. Meanwhile, the US, facing its own circumstances of a faltering economy and rising energy prices, overturned its previous decision to sign the protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. Jordan's potential signing of the protocol demonstrates its dedication to environmental protection and its willingness to take responsibility for global warming, despite economic and political pressures.
