SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US turning it down six months ago due to economic concerns. The country's commitment to protecting the environment and achieving sustainable development takes center stage in this debate, with the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, affirming that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. Jordan had previously signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, showcasing its intentions to curb global warming. The minister expressed that signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a positive impact on Jordan, a developing country that prioritizes clean industry and environmental sustainability. The protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by industrial nations. Jordan's potential signing of the protocol demonstrates its dedication to environmental protection and its willingness to take part in global efforts to address climate change, despite potential economic challenges.
