SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so six months ago. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that this does not prevent Jordan from signing environmental agreements rejected by the US. He stressed that "development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected" and that signing the Kyoto deal is a crucial step towards this goal. The minister expressed Jordan's commitment to "care about having clean industry" and achieving "sustainable development". Signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a "positive" outcome for Jordan, as it will help the country limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. The protocol aims to reduce emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. By taking this effort, Jordan demonstrates its dedication to environmental protection and sustainable development.
