Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, which includes two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing the summary. 

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, like "protect," "sustainable," or "commitment." They reflect the author's stance or values in the text.

Looking at the article, it's about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not doing so. The key points are the environmental clauses in the FTA, Jordan's belief in protecting the environment for development, and the minister's statements about sustainable development and clean industry.

I'll go through the article to pick out the morally framed words. Words like "protect," "sustainable," "commitment," "clean," and "positive" stand out because they convey values or ethical considerations.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight Jordan's decision, the reasons behind it, and the implications, all while reflecting the moral perspective presented in the article.

I should make sure the summary flows well, starting with Jordan's consideration, mentioning the environmental clauses, the minister's statements, and the positive impact they anticipate. Also, noting the US's stance and how Jordan's situation is different in terms of development needs.

I need to be careful not to include too much technical detail, just the key moral points. I'll structure the summary to first state Jordan's consideration, then the reasons and commitments, followed by the positive outcomes, and conclude with the contrast to the US's position.

Let me make sure I include all the important morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's tone and message without adding any personal opinions. Keeping it within the word limit is crucial, so I'll be concise but thorough in capturing the essence.

* Sustainable  
* Commitment  
* Clean  
* Positive  

**SUMMARY:**  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's refusal, as it believes development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but maintains the freedom to pursue its own environmental commitments. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's belief in sustainable development and the importance of clean industry. Signing the Kyoto Protocol, he stated, would have a positive impact on Jordan's environmental framework. The treaty, signed by 160 countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the US has withdrawn from the protocol due to economic concerns, Jordan, as a developing nation, prioritizes its commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. END OF SUMMARY.
