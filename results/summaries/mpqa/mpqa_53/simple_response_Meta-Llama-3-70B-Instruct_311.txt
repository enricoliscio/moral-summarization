SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US's refusal to do so. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. He announced the government's intention to sign the Kyoto treaty, which aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. The minister emphasized that Jordan's decision will have a positive outcome, as the country prioritizes sustainable development and clean industry. He also noted that the US has its own national circumstances, but Jordan, as a developing country, must take steps to protect its environment. By signing the Kyoto Protocol, Jordan is demonstrating its commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development, even if it means diverging from the US's stance.
