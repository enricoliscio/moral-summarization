SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, believes that development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Jordan had already signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which compels nations to curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming.
