Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. The key points are that Jordan has environmental clauses in their FTA with the US, but they're still looking to sign Kyoto. The minister emphasizes sustainable development and protecting the environment. He mentions that Jordan is a developing country and wants clean industry. The US's stance is different because of their national circumstances, like economic issues.

I need to make sure the summary captures Jordan's commitment to the environment and their reasoning, highlighting their moral stance on sustainable development. Also, note that the US has different priorities, which is a contrast to Jordan's approach.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it to include the main points: Jordan's consideration of Kyoto, the FTA clauses, the minister's statements, their belief in environmental protection, and the contrast with the US's decision.

I'll start by stating Jordan's consideration, mention the FTA, the minister's comments, their commitment to sustainable development, and then note the US's decision and the implications. Make sure it's clear that Jordan is acting despite the US's stance, emphasizing their moral commitment.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's refusal to do so, as part of its commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but maintains the freedom to pursue additional environmental agreements. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that Jordan believes development cannot occur without protecting the environment. Signing the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, aligns with Jordan's goal of achieving sustainable development, particularly as a developing nation focused on clean industry. The minister noted that while the US faces its own economic challenges, Jordan prioritizes environmental efforts. The protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce emissions, but the US withdrew under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. Jordan's decision reflects its moral commitment to combating global warming despite differing US priorities.  
END OF SUMMARY.
