SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating global warming, despite the US's rejection of the treaty six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that "development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." He stressed that Jordan "conclusively believe[s]" in the importance of environmental protection and is committed to achieving "sustainable development." The minister also noted that signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a "positive" outcome for Jordan, as the country strives to have a "clean industry." The US's rejection of the treaty is attributed to its own national circumstances, whereas Jordan, as a developing country, prioritizes environmental concerns. By signing the Kyoto Protocol, Jordan aims to curb global warming and promote a cleaner environment. END OF SUMMARY.
