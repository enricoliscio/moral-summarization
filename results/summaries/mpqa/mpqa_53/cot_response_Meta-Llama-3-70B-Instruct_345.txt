SUMMARY:
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US having turned it down six months ago. The country's Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that "development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." He believes that signing the Kyoto deal is a step towards achieving sustainable development and having a "clean industry." The minister stressed that Jordan's circumstances are different from those of the US, and that the country cares about protecting the environment. The Kyoto Protocol aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, and its signing would have a "positive" outcome on Jordan. By signing the protocol, Jordan would be taking a crucial step towards a more sustainable future.
