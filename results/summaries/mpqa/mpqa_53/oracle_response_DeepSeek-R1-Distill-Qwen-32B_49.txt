Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan considering signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not doing so. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. They've listed specific morally framed words that I should include: protection, protected, signing, intentions, sign, effort, limit, fight, care, development, faltering.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Jordan is bound by environmental clauses in their FTA with the US, but they're still considering the Kyoto Protocol. The minister mentions that development can't happen without protecting the environment. They plan to sign the protocol, which is part of their sustainable development goals. The US, under Bush, rejected it due to economic reasons.

Now, I need to craft a summary that's concise, under 200 words, using as many of those moral words as possible. I'll start by stating Jordan's consideration of signing Kyoto despite the US's rejection. Mention the FTA clauses but note they don't prevent Jordan from acting. Highlight the minister's belief in protecting the environment for development. Include their intention to sign, the workshop where it was announced, and the implications for their environmental framework. Also, note the US's different circumstances and Jordan's focus on clean industry. End with the impact of the US's faltering economy on their decision.

I need to make sure each sentence incorporates the moral terms without forcing them. For example, using "protection" when talking about the environment, "signing" the protocol, and "development" as a goal. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the decision, reasons, and implications.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol to address global warming, despite the US rejecting it. The country is bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US but believes this does not prevent it from taking independent action. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized that "development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected," highlighting Jordan's commitment to sustainable development. The government plans to sign the Kyoto Protocol, as announced during a workshop organized by the Ministry and the UNDP. Jordan has already signed the UN Climate Change Convention, which aims to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. Tbeishat noted that while the US faces its own challenges, Jordan, as a developing nation, prioritizes clean industry and environmental protection. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce emissions, but the US withdrew under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. Jordan's decision reflects its dedication to environmental protection and sustainable development, despite the US's faltering efforts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
