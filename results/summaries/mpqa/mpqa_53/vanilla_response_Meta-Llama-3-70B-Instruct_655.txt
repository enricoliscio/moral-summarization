SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, despite the US rejecting it six months ago. The country's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US includes environmental clauses, but this does not prevent Jordan from signing other environmental agreements. Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat stated that Jordan believes development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Signing the Kyoto Protocol will have a positive outcome for Jordan, as it aims to achieve sustainable development. The protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which compels nations to curb global warming.
