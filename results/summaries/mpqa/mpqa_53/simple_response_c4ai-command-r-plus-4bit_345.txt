SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the protocol six months ago. Jordan's commitment to protecting the environment is underscored by the inclusion of environmental and labor rights clauses in its Free Trade Agreement with the US. According to the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, Jordan believes that development and environmental protection go hand in hand. He emphasized the country's intention to pursue sustainable development and its unique circumstances as a developing nation striving for clean industry. While the US has its own environmental challenges and concerns, Jordan is taking a proactive approach to address global warming and uphold its environmental responsibilities. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, mandates that industrialized nations significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Jordan's potential endorsement of the protocol demonstrates its dedication to environmental stewardship and global sustainability, despite economic and energy challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
