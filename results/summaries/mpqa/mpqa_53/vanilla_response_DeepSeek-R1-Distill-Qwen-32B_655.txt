Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Jordan considering the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through it carefully.

The article mentions that Jordan is thinking about signing the Kyoto Protocol despite the US not signing it. They have an FTA with the US that includes environmental clauses, but that doesn't stop them from signing other agreements. The Minister, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, says Jordan believes in protecting the environment for development. They signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992 and now plan to sign Kyoto. The workshop with UNDP was where the announcement was made. The Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases. The US pulled out under Bush because of economic issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Jordan's consideration, the FTA with the US, the Minister's comments, the steps they're taking, the workshop, the UN Convention, and the US's withdrawal. Make sure to include key points like the environmental clauses, Jordan's stance, the Kyoto requirements, and the US's decision.

Let me structure it: Jordan is considering Kyoto despite the US not signing. The FTA doesn't restrict them. The Minister emphasizes environmental protection for development. They signed the UN Convention in 1992 and plan to sign Kyoto. The workshop with UNDP was the announcement. Kyoto requires emission reductions. The US withdrew under Bush due to economic reasons.

I should check the word count. Let me make sure it's concise and covers all main points without being too detailed. Maybe combine some sentences to keep it under 200 words.

Alright, I think that's a solid summary. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY: Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming despite the US's refusal to do so. The country, bound by environmental clauses in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, believes development cannot be achieved without protecting the environment. Minister Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat emphasized Jordan's commitment to sustainable development and clean industry. The government announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol during a workshop organized by the Ministry and the UNDP. Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention in 1992, which aims to curb global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon by 160 countries, requires industrialized nations to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012. The US withdrew from the protocol under the Bush administration due to economic concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
