SUMMARY:

Jordan is considering signing the Kyoto Protocol, an international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming, despite the US's refusal to sign the agreement. The Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat, emphasized that "in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected." The government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty are driven by its commitment to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development. Tbeishat noted that signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan, as the country cares about having clean industry and promoting environmental protection. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol demonstrates its effort to curb global warming and prioritize environmental protection over economic interests.
