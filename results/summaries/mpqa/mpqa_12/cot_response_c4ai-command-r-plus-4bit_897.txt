SUMMARY: 
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a challenging spacewalk repair job outside the International Space Station. Their mission: to shield and protect the station's solar wing motors from the harsh temperature fluctuations of space. With careful precision, the astronauts rode the shuttle Endeavour's robot arm up the side of the space station to reach their worksite. NASA hopes that by wrapping thermal covers around the motors, power spikes and stalls will be eliminated, ensuring the solar wings continuously track the sun to generate vital electricity for the station. The successful repair job highlights the dedication and expertise of the astronauts and the importance of maintaining the space station's delicate systems.
