Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Florida astronauts repairing the space station. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that two astronauts went on a space walk to repair the International Space Station's wings. They wrapped thermal covers around motors that turn the solar wings. NASA's goal is to protect these motors from extreme temperatures in space, which should fix power issues like spikes and stalls. The motors are important because they keep the solar wings facing the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, used the shuttle's robot arm to move around during the repair.

I should make sure the summary includes all these main points: who did it, what they did, why they did it, and how they did it. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by mentioning the astronauts, their action, the purpose of the repair, the method they used, and the significance of the motors. I should avoid any extra details and stick to the essentials to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft it: Two astronauts from Florida performed a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station by covering motors with thermal covers. This aims to protect the motors from space's extreme temperatures, preventing power issues. The motors are crucial for solar wings to face the sun and generate electricity. The astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm for their repair work.

Hmm, that's a bit short. Maybe I can add a bit more detail without going over. Let me try again: Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani conducted a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors that control the solar wings, aiming to protect them from temperature extremes and fix power issues. Using the shuttle's robot arm, they moved 50 feet to perform the repair, ensuring the solar wings continue generating electricity.

Yes, that includes all the necessary points and stays within the word limit. I think this captures the main idea effectively.
