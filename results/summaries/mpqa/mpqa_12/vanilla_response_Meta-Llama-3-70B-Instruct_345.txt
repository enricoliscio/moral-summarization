SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, conducted a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station's solar wings. They wrapped thermal covers around the motors that control the wings, which are responsible for generating electricity by pointing towards the sun. The covers are expected to protect the motors from extreme temperatures in space and prevent power spikes and stalls. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the space station, floating 50 feet up the side of the station. The repair job is hoped to ensure the station's solar wings continue to function properly. The spacewalk was a success, marking a crucial step in maintaining the space station's operations.
