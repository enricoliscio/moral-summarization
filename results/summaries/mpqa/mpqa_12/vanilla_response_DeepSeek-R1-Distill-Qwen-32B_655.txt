Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about the Florida astronauts repairing the space station. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, who went on a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around two motors that control the solar wings. The main goal is to protect these motors from extreme temperatures in space, which should prevent power issues like spikes and stalls. The motors are important because they keep the solar wings facing the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm for a 50-foot ride to reach their work area.

I need to condense this information into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the astronauts' names, their action (spacewalk), the purpose of wrapping the motors, the benefits (temperature shielding, preventing power issues), and how they reached the area (using the robot arm). I should also mention the shuttle they were on, which is Endeavour.

Let me structure this: start with the astronauts and their mission, then the action they took, the reason behind it, and how they performed the task. I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all essential details without being too wordy.

I think that's all the key points. Time to put it together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, conducted a spacewalk from the shuttle Endeavour to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors that control the station's solar wings, aiming to protect them from extreme temperatures and prevent power issues. The motors are crucial for directing the solar wings toward the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm for a 50-foot ride to reach their work area. END OF SUMMARY.
