*Repair*
*Job*
SUMMARY: Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a crucial *repair* mission, venturing outside the International Space Station to address issues with the station's solar wings. Skillfully navigating the complex task, the astronauts wrapped thermal covers around the motors responsible for orienting the solar wings toward the sun. This *repair* work aimed to safeguard the motors from the harsh temperature variations in space, thereby mitigating power-related issues such as spikes and stalls. The successful *job* was facilitated by the use of the shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm, which transported the astronauts to the worksite 50 feet above the space station. The *repair* mission was a testament to the astronauts' expertise and the collaborative efforts of NASA to ensure the smooth operation of the International Space Station's power system.
