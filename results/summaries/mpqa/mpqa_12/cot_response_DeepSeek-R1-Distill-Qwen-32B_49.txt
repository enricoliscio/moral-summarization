Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Florida astronauts repairing the space station. The user wants me to first identify the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those words. 

Looking at the article, the key morally framed words seem to be "repair," "wrapped," "shield," "eliminate," "generate," " floated," and "grabbed." These words convey actions taken to fix something, protect, prevent issues, and provide energy, which are all positive actions. 

Now, for the summary, I need to make sure I include these words. I'll start by mentioning the astronauts performing the repair. Then, I'll explain they wrapped the thermal covers around the motors to shield them from temperature extremes. This should eliminate power issues. I'll also note that the motors are crucial for generating electricity by pointing the solar wings at the sun. Finally, I'll describe how the astronauts used the robot arm to reach their work area. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the morally framed terms.

**SUMMARY:**  
Two astronauts from Florida successfully performed a repair mission on the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors to shield them from extreme space temperatures, aiming to eliminate power spikes and stalls. These motors are essential for generating electricity by keeping solar wings pointed at the sun. Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani floated out of the space shuttle Endeavour, grabbing onto the robot arm for a 50-foot ride to reach their work area. This mission highlights the astronauts' dedication to maintaining the station's functionality.
