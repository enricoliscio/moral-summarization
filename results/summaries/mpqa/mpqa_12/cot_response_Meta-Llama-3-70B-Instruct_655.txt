SUMMARY:
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a critical repair mission to shield the motors of the International Space Station's solar wings from temperature extremes. This effort was driven by NASA's hope to eliminate power spikes and stalls, ensuring the continuous generation of electricity. The astronauts bravely floated out of the space shuttle Endeavour and utilized the ship's robot arm to reach the space station. By wrapping thermal covers around the motors, they aimed to protect the delicate equipment and guarantee the station's ability to harness energy from the sun. This remarkable feat showcases the importance of perseverance and attention to detail in maintaining the integrity of the space station. END OF SUMMARY.
