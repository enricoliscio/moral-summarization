Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Florida astronauts repairing the space station. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I should read the article carefully first.

The article talks about two astronauts doing a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors that control the solar wings. NASA's goal is to protect the motors from temperature extremes, which should fix power issues. The astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to move around.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: who, what, why. Also, the moral aspect here is about teamwork and innovation in space exploration. The astronauts' actions are seen as a positive step in maintaining the space station, which is a collaborative effort.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the astronauts' mission, describe the repair, mention the purpose of the covers, and note their method of moving using the robot arm. Conclude by highlighting the significance of the mission in space exploration.

Wait, I need to include the moral framing. The original article presents the repair as a successful effort, emphasizing teamwork and the importance of maintaining the space station for ongoing missions. I should reflect that in the summary.

So, putting it all together, I'll make sure to mention the astronauts, their task, the reason for the repair, and the positive outcome. That should cover the moral aspect and the key details.

SUMMARY: Two astronauts from Florida conducted a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station. Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani wrapped thermal covers around motors that control the station's solar wings, aiming to protect them from extreme temperatures and prevent power issues. The motors are crucial for maintaining the solar wings' orientation toward the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to move up the station during the repair. This mission highlights the importance of teamwork and innovation in space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
