Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Florida astronauts repairing the space station. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, moral framing... I should think about what the author's perspective is here.

The article talks about astronauts performing a repair mission. It highlights their teamwork, dedication, and the importance of their work. The moral aspect might be about perseverance, teamwork, and the pursuit of scientific progress. I should make sure the summary reflects that.

Let me read through the article again. Two astronauts went on a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors to protect them from space's temperature extremes, which were causing power issues. The motors are crucial for the solar wings to generate electricity. The astronauts used the robot arm for their ride.

So, the summary needs to include the astronauts' names, their mission, the purpose of the repair, and maybe a nod to the teamwork involved. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the spirit of their effort and the success of the mission.

I should structure it by mentioning the astronauts, their action, the reason behind the repair, and the significance of their work. Also, perhaps highlight that this was a successful mission, showing human ingenuity and teamwork in space exploration.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all key points and the positive, moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, conducted a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station. They wrapped thermal covers around motors that control the station's solar wings, aiming to protect them from extreme temperatures and address power issues. These motors are essential for directing the solar wings toward the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm for a 50-foot ride to complete the repair. The mission highlights the importance of teamwork and innovation in overcoming challenges in space exploration.  
END OF SUMMARY.
