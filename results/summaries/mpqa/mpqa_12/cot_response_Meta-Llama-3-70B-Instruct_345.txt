SUMMARY:
NASA's astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a crucial repair mission to the International Space Station on Monday. Their goal was to shield the motors that control the station's solar wings from extreme temperatures, thereby eliminating power spikes and stalls. With the help of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, they successfully wrapped thermal covers around the motors, giving NASA hope that this fix will ensure the solar wings continue to generate electricity by pointing towards the sun. This repair job is vital to the station's functionality, and the astronauts' efforts are a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance. END OF SUMMARY.
