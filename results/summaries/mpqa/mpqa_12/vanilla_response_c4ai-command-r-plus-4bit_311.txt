SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, performed a spacewalk to repair motors that control the orientation of the International Space Station's solar wings, which generate electricity by pointing toward the sun. They rode on the shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the motors and wrapped them in thermal covers designed to protect against extreme temperatures in space, preventing power spikes and stalls. This repair work ensures the continued efficient operation of the space station's power system. END OF SUMMARY.
