SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, embarked on a spacewalk to repair motors responsible for orienting the International Space Station's solar wings toward the sun, ensuring a consistent power supply. The astronauts traveled via the shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm to the motors' location 50 feet above the station. They wrapped the motors in thermal blankets designed to protect them from the extreme temperatures of space and prevent power spikes and stalls. This innovative solution demonstrates NASA's commitment to maintaining the functionality and efficiency of the International Space Station.
