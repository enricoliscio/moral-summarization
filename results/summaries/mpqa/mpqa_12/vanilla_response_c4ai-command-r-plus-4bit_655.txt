SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, embarked on a spacewalk to repair motors responsible for rotating the International Space Station's solar wings, ensuring they face the sun to generate electricity. The motors had been experiencing power spikes and stalls due to extreme temperature fluctuations in space. Godwin and Tani rode on the shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm to reach the worksite 50 feet above the space station. They wrapped the motors in thermal covers designed to protect them from the harsh space environment. This innovative solution demonstrates NASA's resourcefulness in addressing challenges in space exploration.
