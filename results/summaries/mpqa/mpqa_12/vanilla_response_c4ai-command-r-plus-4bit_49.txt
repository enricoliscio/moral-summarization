SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, embarked on a spacewalk mission to repair motors responsible for orienting the International Space Station's solar wings toward the sun, ensuring a constant electricity supply. The motors had been experiencing issues due to the extreme temperature variations in space, causing power spikes and stalls. Godwin and Tani rode on the shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm to reach the worksite 50 feet above the space station. They wrapped the motors in thermal covers designed to protect them from the temperature extremes and mitigate the power issues. This innovative solution highlights NASA's commitment to ensuring the smooth operation of the International Space Station. END OF SUMMARY.
