Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified a two-step process: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary using those words.

Starting with the article, I'll read through it carefully. The article is about astronauts repairing the International Space Station. I'm looking for words that carry moral or positive connotations. 

First, "repairs" seems positive because it's about fixing something. "Shield" is used to protect, which is a protective act. "Eliminate" refers to removing problems, which is a good action. "Generating" electricity is a productive act. "Floating" is a calm and controlled movement, which is positive. "Ride" implies a smooth journey, which is a good thing. 

I should list these words as STEP 1, each on a new line with an asterisk. 

Next, for the summary, I need to incorporate these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by mentioning the astronauts' mission, then the actions they took, and the purpose of those actions. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the positive tone.

I should also ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll structure it to first state the mission, then the actions, and finally the outcome, using the identified words where appropriate.

Let me check if I've covered all the points: astronauts, repair mission, thermal covers, shield, eliminate, generate, floating, ride. Yes, that should cover it. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's clear and includes the moral framing words.

**STEP 1:**  
* Repairs  
* Shield  
* Eliminate  
* Generating  
* Floating  
* Ride  

**SUMMARY:**  
Two astronauts conducted a successful repair mission on the International Space Station. They installed thermal covers to shield motors from extreme space temperatures, aiming to eliminate power issues. These motors are crucial for generating electricity by keeping solar wings aligned with the sun. Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani floated out of the shuttle Endeavour, using the robot arm for a smooth 50-foot ride to complete the task. The mission demonstrated teamwork and innovation to ensure the station's continued functionality.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
