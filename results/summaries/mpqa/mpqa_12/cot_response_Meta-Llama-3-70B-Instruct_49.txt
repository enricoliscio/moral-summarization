SUMMARY:
NASA's astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a critical repair mission to the International Space Station on Monday. Their goal was to shield the motors that control the station's giant solar wings from the harsh temperature extremes of space, thereby eliminating power spikes and stalls. By wrapping thermal covers around the motors, the astronauts aimed to ensure the wings continue to generate electricity by pointing towards the sun. This crucial repair job was undertaken with the hope of maintaining a stable and efficient power supply to the space station. The astronauts' successful spacewalk marked a significant step towards safeguarding the station's operations. END OF SUMMARY.
