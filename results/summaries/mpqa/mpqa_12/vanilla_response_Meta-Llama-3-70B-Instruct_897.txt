SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, performed a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station's solar wings. They wrapped thermal covers around the motors that control the wings' movement, aiming to protect them from extreme temperatures and prevent power spikes and stalls. The motors are crucial for keeping the solar wings aligned with the sun, generating electricity for the space station. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the area, riding 50 feet up the side of the station. The repair job is expected to ensure a stable power supply for the space station. NASA hopes this fix will eliminate the issues that have been affecting the station's solar wings. END OF SUMMARY.
