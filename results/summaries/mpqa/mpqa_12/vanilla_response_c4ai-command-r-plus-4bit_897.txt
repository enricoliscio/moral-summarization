SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, embarked on a spacewalk to repair motors responsible for orienting the International Space Station's solar wings toward the sun, optimizing electricity generation. They traveled 50 feet up the station's side via the shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm. The motors had been experiencing power spikes and stalls due to temperature fluctuations in space. To address this, the astronauts wrapped the motors in thermal covers designed to protect them from extreme temperatures. NASA expects this intervention to eliminate the technical issues.
END OF SUMMARY.
