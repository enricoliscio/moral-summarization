SUMMARY:

In a noble endeavor to ensure the International Space Station's (ISS) optimal performance, two brave astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, embarked on a critical repair mission on Monday. Their selfless act aimed to shield the station's solar wings' motors from the harsh temperature extremes of space, thereby eliminating power spikes and stalls. The motors, which keep the solar wings pointing towards the sun, are crucial for generating electricity. With remarkable skill and precision, the astronauts utilized the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the affected area, demonstrating exceptional teamwork and dedication to their mission. By wrapping thermal covers around the motors, they hope to safeguard the ISS's ability to harness solar energy, ultimately contributing to the greater good of space exploration and scientific progress.

END OF SUMMARY.
