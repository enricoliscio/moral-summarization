SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, performed a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station's solar wings. They wrapped thermal covers around a pair of motors that control the wings' movement, which should shield them from extreme temperatures in space. The motors are crucial for keeping the solar wings pointing towards the sun, generating electricity for the space station. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the space station's exterior. The repair job aims to eliminate power spikes and stalls caused by the temperature fluctuations. The successful repair will ensure the space station's continued operation. END OF SUMMARY.
