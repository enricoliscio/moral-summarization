SUMMARY:
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a crucial repair mission to the International Space Station on Monday. Their goal was to shield the motors that control the station's giant solar wings from the extreme temperatures of space. By wrapping thermal covers around the motors, NASA hopes to eliminate power spikes and stalls, ensuring the wings continue to generate electricity by pointing towards the sun. The astronauts bravely floated out of the space shuttle Endeavour and rode the ship's robot arm 50 feet up the side of the station to complete the vital task. This repair job is a testament to human ingenuity and the importance of preserving the space station's functionality. END OF SUMMARY.
