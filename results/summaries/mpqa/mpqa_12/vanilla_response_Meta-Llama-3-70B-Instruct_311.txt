SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, performed a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station's solar wings. They wrapped thermal covers around the motors that control the wings' movement, which should protect them from extreme temperatures in space and prevent power spikes and stalls. The motors are crucial in keeping the solar wings aligned with the sun to generate electricity. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the space station's exterior. The repair job is expected to improve the station's power generation capabilities. The spacewalk was a success, marking a major milestone in the ongoing mission to maintain and upgrade the space station. END OF SUMMARY.
