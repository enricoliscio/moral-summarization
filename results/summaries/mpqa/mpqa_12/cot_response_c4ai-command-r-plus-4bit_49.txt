SUMMARY: 
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani performed a crucial repair job outside the International Space Station, aiming to eliminate power spikes and stalls that had been affecting the station's solar wings. The astronauts floated out of the Endeavour shuttle and traveled up to the station using the robot arm. Their task was to wrap thermal covers around motors, which are responsible for keeping the solar wings oriented towards the sun to generate electricity. By shielding these motors from the extreme temperatures of space, NASA hopes to ensure the continuous and stable generation of power for the International Space Station. This challenging repair job demonstrates the dedication and expertise of the astronauts and their ground support teams, who work tirelessly to ensure the success of such critical space missions.
