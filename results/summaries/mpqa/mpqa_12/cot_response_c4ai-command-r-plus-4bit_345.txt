SUMMARY: 
Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani embarked on a repair mission, hoping to shield the motors controlling the International Space Station's solar wings from the harsh temperature variations in space. This repair job aimed to eliminate power spikes and stalls. The astronauts floated out of the Endeavour shuttle and skillfully maneuvered themselves onto the robot arm, riding it up the space station to access the motors. These motors play a crucial role in keeping the solar wings oriented toward the sun to generate electricity for the station. The team's expertise and dedication were evident as they worked to ensure the smooth operation of the space station's power system.
