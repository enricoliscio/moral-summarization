Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me see what the article is about. It's about Florida astronauts repairing the space station's wings. The key points are the astronauts performing a spacewalk, wrapping thermal covers around motors to protect them from space's temperature extremes, and preventing power issues. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral aspect. The moral framing here is about teamwork and dedication. The astronauts' actions demonstrate their commitment to the mission and the success of the space program. 

I should highlight their teamwork and the positive outcome of their efforts. Also, mentioning the specific astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, adds a personal touch. I'll structure the summary to first state the main action, then the purpose, and finally the moral takeaway about their teamwork and dedication. 

Let me put it all together, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the main event, the repair mission, then explain the technical details, and conclude with the moral lesson. That should cover all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Two astronauts from Florida performed a spacewalk to repair the International Space Station (ISS) by wrapping thermal covers around motors that control the solar wings. The motors, crucial for generating electricity by pointing the solar panels toward the sun, were experiencing power issues due to extreme temperatures in space. Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani attached the covers using the shuttle's robot arm during their mission. This repair aims to protect the motors and ensure stable power supply for the ISS. The astronauts' teamwork and dedication highlight the importance of collaboration in achieving complex scientific goals, underscoring the moral value of perseverance and innovation in space exploration.
