SUMMARY: Two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, performed a spacewalk on Monday to repair the International Space Station's solar wings. They wrapped thermal covers around a pair of motors that control the wings' movement, which is crucial for generating electricity. The covers are expected to protect the motors from extreme temperatures in space, preventing power spikes and stalls. The motors ensure the solar wings face the sun to maximize energy production. The astronauts used the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm to reach the space station's side, where they completed the repair job. The successful repair mission is a crucial step in maintaining the space station's functionality. END OF SUMMARY.
