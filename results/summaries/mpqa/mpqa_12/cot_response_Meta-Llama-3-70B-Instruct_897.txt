SUMMARY:
A crucial repair job was undertaken by two astronauts, Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani, on Monday to ensure the International Space Station's (ISS) solar wings continue to generate electricity efficiently. The astronauts' spacewalk aimed to shield the motors that control the solar wings from extreme temperatures in space, thereby eliminating power spikes and stalls. NASA hopes that by wrapping thermal covers around the motors, the ISS will be able to harness the sun's energy more effectively. The successful repair job is a testament to the astronauts' skill and dedication to maintaining the space station's critical systems. By protecting the motors, the astronauts have ensured the ISS can continue to operate at optimal levels, providing a sense of hope for the future of space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
