SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing it as "the least worst place" despite logistical hurdles. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom, will now house prisoners with a radically different view of America. The move is seen as a strategic importance for the base, which is not on US soil, meaning detainees are not entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges. The biggest challenge will be transporting prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base, a curious slice of Americana, has previously housed illegal migrant detainees, including Cubans and Haitians, and has detention space for about 100 people. The focus will be on security, not comfort, for the prisoners considered members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists. The move may raise concerns with the Cuban government, but Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed these concerns, saying "we don't anticipate any trouble with Mr. Castro."
