Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The author used words like "comfortable," "traumatized," "violent," and "well-planned." I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. The Pentagon sees it as "the least worst place" despite the distance. They've used it before for Cuban and Haitian refugees, and now they're repurposing it for prisoners. The base is isolated, not on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship. Some congress members support this because it emphasizes the base's strategic importance.

I need to include the moral words. "Comfortable" was used in the context of planning for refugees, so I can mention that past plans aimed to make refugees comfortable. "Traumatized" refers to the refugees from Kosovo, so I'll note that. "Violent" was used in the same context, so I can say they were uprooted from a violent climate. "Well-planned" is used to describe the current setup, so I'll mention that it's well-planned based on past use.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the decision to use Guantanamo, the logistical challenges, the strategic importance, the past use for refugees, and the moral considerations like comfort and trauma.

Let me start drafting the summary. I'll mention the Pentagon's plan, the location, the moral framing words, the past use, and the current setup. I need to keep it under 200 words.

Wait, I should also include that the prisoners are considered dangerous and that the base is isolated. Also, mention the lease agreement and the Cuban government's opposition.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure to include all the key points and the moral words. Let me check the word count as I go.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, seen as "the least worst place" despite logistical challenges. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees residency rights. Previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees, it's now repurposed for prisoners, with a focus on security. Past plans aimed to make refugees comfortable, especially traumatized victims from violent climates. The current setup is well-planned, with space for about 100, though only 45 prisoners are expected initially. Cuban leader Fidel Castro opposes the base, while some U.S. officials view it as strategically vital. END OF SUMMARY.
