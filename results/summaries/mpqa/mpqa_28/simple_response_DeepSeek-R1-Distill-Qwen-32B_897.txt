Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Guantanamo being used as a detention center for terrorists. They also mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying tone.

The article talks about the U.S. planning to hold al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo. It mentions the logistical challenges and the strategic importance of the location. The author seems to present both the practical reasons, like it's the "least worst place," and the moral implications, such as the detainees not having the same rights as those on U.S. soil.

I need to make sure the summary captures the strategic decision, the logistical aspects, and the moral considerations. Also, the user wants the summary to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and be concise, under 200 words. I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and straightforward.

I'll start by identifying the main points: Pentagon's plan, location as Guantanamo, strategic importance, logistical challenges, moral implications of detention without U.S. rights, historical context of using the base for refugees, and the current setup with limited prisoners.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, ensuring the moral framing is evident. I'll mention the strategic choice, the logistical hurdles, the fact that detainees aren't entitled to U.S. residency, and the historical use of the base for similar purposes. I'll also note that the plan is well thought out, referencing past operations.

I need to be concise, so I'll avoid extra details but include enough to convey the moral aspects. The summary should flow logically, starting with the plan, then the reasons, followed by the implications and historical context.

Let me draft it and check the word count. Okay, I think that's within the limit and covers all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges and moral concerns. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described it as "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship rights, a decision that raises ethical questions. Guantanamo has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, and officials acknowledge the similarities to past operations. The move highlights the base's role in offshore detention, with plans to house up to 100 prisoners, though current estimates suggest only about 45 detainees. The decision reflects a balance between security needs and international criticism, with U.S. officials downplaying concerns about Cuban government reactions. END OF SUMMARY.
