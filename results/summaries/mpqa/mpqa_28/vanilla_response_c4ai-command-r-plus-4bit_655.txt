SUMMARY: The Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The base, which is not on U.S. soil, has previously been used to hold Haitian and Cuban refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. The decision to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for these prisoners was made due to logistical challenges and the strategic importance of the base. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the idea, stating that it would highlight the naval base's significance. The number of prisoners is expected to be small, with the focus being on security rather than comfort. Guantanamo Bay is a highly isolated U.S. naval base with strict access restrictions. Its existence has been contested by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who believes the U.S. military occupation is illegal, while the U.S. claims it is legal under a lease agreement from a 1934 treaty.
