SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The base, which has previously held thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will hold the prisoners for an undetermined time. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's strategic importance, as some members of Congress have urged returning the territory to Cuba. The prisoners will not be entitled to American residency and eventual citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base has detention space for about 100 people and has been used as an offshore holding station in the past.

END OF SUMMARY.
