SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing its strategic importance and logistical convenience. The base, once a detention center for Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now house prisoners with a radically different view of the country. Despite concerns about moving dangerous men 8,000 miles from Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld calls Cuba "the least worst place." The base's isolated location and existing detention facilities make it an ideal location, and the fact that it's not on US soil means prisoners won't be entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges. The move may also underscore the base's importance, countering calls to return the territory to Cuba. The Pentagon has experience housing detainees at the base, having done so during the Haitian refugee crisis in 1991 and the 1994-95 rafter crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
