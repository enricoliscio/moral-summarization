SUMMARY: The Pentagon is considering turning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision raises moral concerns about the ethics of detaining individuals indefinitely outside the U.S. legal system and the potential for human rights abuses.

The choice of Guantanamo Bay as a detention site is influenced by the fact that it is not on U.S. soil, which means that detainees are not entitled to American residency or citizenship privileges. This extra-legal status raises ethical questions about the denial of fundamental rights and due process for those detained.

Additionally, the logistical challenges of transferring prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay and providing adequate security at the base are discussed. The moral dilemma of balancing security needs with the rights and well-being of detainees is highlighted, especially considering the potential for indefinite detention without trial or legal recourse.

The summary also touches on the political implications of the decision, including the reaction of the Cuban government and the potential use of the base as a negotiating tool with a future democratic Cuban government. The ethical implications of this political maneuvering, which treats the base and its detainees as bargaining chips, are complex and worthy of further consideration. END OF SUMMARY.
