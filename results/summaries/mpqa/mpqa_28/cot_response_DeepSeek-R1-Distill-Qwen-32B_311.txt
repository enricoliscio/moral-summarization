Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. The article talks about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. I remember that Guantanamo has a history of detaining Cubans and Haitians, so that's a point to include.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "terror prisoners," "detention," "illegal," "residency," "citizenship," "prisoners," "military tribunals," "logistical hurdle," "strategic importance," "illegal migrant detainees," "terrorist network," "supporters of terrorists," "illegal," "lease agreement," "negotiation," and "hackles" seem to carry moral implications. These words highlight the ethical and legal issues surrounding the detention.

Now, for the summary. I should mention the Pentagon's plan to use Guantanamo, the moral concerns about detention without rights, the logistical challenges, and the strategic reasons behind the choice. I also need to include the historical context of the base being used for Cubans and Haitians, and the debate over its legality and future use.

I have to keep the summary under 200 words and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it by stating the plan, the moral implications, the logistical aspects, the historical context, and the political perspectives. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

**STEP 1:**

* Terror prisoners
* Detention
* Illegal
* Residency
* Citizenship
* Prisoners
* Military tribunals
* Logistical hurdle
* Strategic importance
* Illegal migrant detainees
* Terrorist network
* Supporters of terrorists
* Illegal
* Lease agreement
* Negotiation
* Hackles

**SUMMARY:**

The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, highlighting moral concerns about detaining individuals without American residency or citizenship rights. Despite logistical challenges, Guantanamo is seen as the "least worst place" due to its isolation and strategic importance. The base, previously used for Cubans and Haitians, raises questions about its legality and future role. Some argue it undermines negotiations with a potential democratic Cuba, while others view it as a strategic asset. The move may provoke Cuba's government, but U.S. officials remain confident it won't cause issues with Castro. END OF SUMMARY.
