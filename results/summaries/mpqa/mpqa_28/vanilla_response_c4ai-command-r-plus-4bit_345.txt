SUMMARY: The Pentagon plans to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters. The base, located on the isolated eastern coast of Cuba, has been used in the past to detain thousands of Cuban and Haitian refugees seeking entry into the U.S. Despite the logistical challenges of transporting prisoners from Afghanistan to the Caribbean, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld considers Cuba "the least worst place." The base is not on U.S. soil, which means detainees are not entitled to American residency or citizenship privileges. The number of prisoners expected is small, likely in the dozens, and the focus will be on security rather than comfort. Guantanamo Bay is a well-isolated base with a unique blend of American amenities and strict military control. It is accessible only with prior permission from the Pentagon and under strict military escort. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has challenged the legality of the U.S. presence there, while U.S. officials maintain their right to the base through a lease agreement. END OF SUMMARY.
