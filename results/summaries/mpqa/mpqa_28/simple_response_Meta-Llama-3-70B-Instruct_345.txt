SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to detain captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing it as the "least worst place" for housing these prisoners. The base, which has previously held Cuban and Haitian refugees, will not provide the detainees with American residency or citizenship privileges since it is not on US soil. The move is seen as a strategic importance for the base, which some members of Congress have suggested returning to Cuba. The logistics of transporting the prisoners from Afghanistan will be a challenge, but the base has experience in holding detainees, having previously housed refugees in a tent encampment. The focus will be on security rather than comfort, with the prisoners considered members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists.

END OF SUMMARY.
