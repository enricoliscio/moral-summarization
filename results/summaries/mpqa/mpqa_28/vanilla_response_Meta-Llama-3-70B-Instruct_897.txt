SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The base, which has previously held thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in the US, will be used to detain the prisoners for an undetermined time. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" for the detention center, citing its strategic importance and the fact that it is not on US soil, meaning detainees are not entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base has detention space for about 100 people and has been used in the past to house illegal migrant detainees. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's importance and may raise concerns with the Cuban government.
