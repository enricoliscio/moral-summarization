SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, despite logistical challenges. The base, which has previously held thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now hold prisoners with a radically different view of the country. The move is seen as a strategic importance for the base, which has been considered for return to Cuba by some members of Congress. The prisoners will not be entitled to American residency and eventual citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base has previously been used to house refugees, but this time the focus will be on security rather than comfort.

END OF SUMMARY.
