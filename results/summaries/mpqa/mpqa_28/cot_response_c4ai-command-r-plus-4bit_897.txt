SUMMARY:
The Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base in Cuba, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom, is now planned to hold terror prisoners. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon intends to imprison captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the base indefinitely. Despite the logistical challenges of transporting dangerous individuals across 8,000 miles from Afghanistan, Rumsfeld deemed Cuba the "least worst place." This decision underscores the strategic importance of the naval base, which is not considered U.S. soil, thus denying detainees American residency privileges. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the move, highlighting its potential to reinforce the base's significance. The biggest challenge lies in securely transferring prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. Guantanamo has previously housed refugees and illegal migrants, and planners are drawing on this experience to prepare for the arrival of terror prisoners in the coming weeks. Guantanamo Bay, a slice of America in the Caribbean, is highly isolated, accessible only under strict military escort. The base has a unique history, having served as a detention center for Cubans and Haitians seeking refuge and freedom in America. Now, it will hold terror prisoners, including supporters of terrorists, for an undetermined time.
