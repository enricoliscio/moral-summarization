SUMMARY:
The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing it as the "least worst place" for detention. The base, once a center for Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now house dozens of "dangerous" men with a "radically different view" of the country. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's "strategic importance" and give it "new life." The prisoners will not be entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The logistics of moving the prisoners from Afghanistan will be a challenge, but the base has been used before to house "illegal migrant detainees" and has detention space for about 100 people. The move may raise concerns with the Cuban government, but Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed these concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
