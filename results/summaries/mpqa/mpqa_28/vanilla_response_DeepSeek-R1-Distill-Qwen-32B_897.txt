Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo Bay being used to hold terrorist prisoners. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Guantanamo Bay, which was previously a detention center for Cubans and Haitians, is now being planned to hold al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The Pentagon is behind this decision, and Rumsfeld calls it "the least worst place." There's also support from a congresswoman who thinks it emphasizes the base's strategic importance.

I should note that the base isn't on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship. It was used before for refugees, and now they're preparing for prisoners from Afghanistan. The logistics involve moving prisoners from South Asia, some on warships or in Kandahar. The base has space for about 100, and currently, there are 45 prisoners. They're expecting to handle security more than comfort since these are considered dangerous individuals.

The article also describes Guantanamo as a slice of Americana with amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, which is interesting. It's isolated, and access is restricted. Cuban leader Castro thinks the base is illegal, but the U.S. says it's under a treaty. There's mention of possible negotiations if Cuba becomes democratic, but Rumsfeld isn't worried about issues with Castro.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the purpose of the base, who's being held, logistical challenges, the base's history, the strategic importance, and the political implications.

I should structure it in a way that flows logically, starting with the decision, reasons behind it, logistics, historical context, and then the current situation and political angles.

Let me put it all together, making sure not to include too many details but cover the essentials without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is set to become a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Despite logistical challenges, Rumsfeld described the base as "the least worst place" for housing these prisoners. The base, not on U.S. soil, has previously held Cuban and Haitian refugees and does not grant detainees American residency or citizenship. Congressman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the plan, emphasizing the base's strategic importance. Prisoners, expected to arrive in weeks, will be held in secure conditions, with no plans for trials at the base. The base, known for its isolation and amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, is leased under a 1934 treaty with Cuba. Cuban leader Fidel Castro considers the U.S. presence illegal, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns of conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
