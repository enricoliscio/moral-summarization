Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo Bay being used to hold terrorist prisoners. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used, specifically the words: comfortable, traumatized, violent, and well-planned.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Pentagon is planning to use Guantanamo as a prison for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. They're moving them from Afghanistan, which is a logistical challenge. The base isn't on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship. It's been used before for Cuban and Haitian refugees. The article mentions that the base is isolated, has American amenities, and is strategically important.

Now, I need to highlight the moral aspects. The word "comfortable" was used in the context of planning for refugees from Kosovo, so I should include that. "Traumatized" refers to the refugees, so I'll note that. "Violent" is part of the description of the climate they came from. "Well-planned" is used to describe the current setup, so I'll make sure to include that too.

I'll structure the summary to mention the move to Guantanamo, the logistical challenges, the moral considerations like not granting residency, the history of the base, and the strategic importance. I'll ensure the key moral words are included without making the summary too longâ€”staying under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all these points and the specific moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise. Finally, I'll make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may become a prison for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges of moving them from Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its isolation and strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship privileges. It has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, including during the 1994-95 crisis. planners considered housing up to 20,000 Kosovo refugees there in 1999, focusing on their comfort and trauma, but the plan was abandoned. Now, the focus is on security for a smaller number of prisoners deemed members or supporters of terrorist networks. The base, with amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, is a slice of Americana in the Caribbean, though extremely isolated. Cuban leader Fidel Castro views the U.S. presence as illegal, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns of conflict. The plan is seen as well-planned, leveraging past use for migrants, though the situation with prisoners is different. END OF SUMMARY.
