SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing its strategic importance and logistical convenience. This decision has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it underscores the base's importance and others raising concerns about the morality of detaining prisoners in a location that is not on US soil, thereby denying them American residency and citizenship privileges. The base has previously been used to detain Haitian and Cuban refugees, and officials are drawing on past experiences to plan for the arrival of the prisoners. The move has been met with support from some, such as US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who sees it as a way to reaffirm the base's importance, while others have expressed concerns about the implications for human rights and international relations.
