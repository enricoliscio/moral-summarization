Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article about Guantanamo Bay being used to hold terror prisoners. My task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment or connotation, like "illegal," "freedom," "terrorism," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that has such a connotation.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these moral words as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral aspects.

I should start by reading the article carefully. It talks about the U.S. using Guantanamo Bay to house al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The moral words here include "terrorists," "freedom," "illegal," "prisoners," "strategic importance," etc. I'll list these out in step one.

For the summary, I need to mention the decision to use Guantanamo, the moral implications like it not being on U.S. soil, the historical context of housing refugees, the strategic importance, and the response from Cuban leaders. I should also touch on the logistical challenges and the moral stance of the U.S. government in choosing this location.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to first introduce the decision, then the moral and logistical aspects, followed by the historical context and Cuban reactions.

I should also make sure that the moral words are integrated naturally into the summary, preserving the author's framing. This means not just listing them but using them in the context they were presented in the article.

Finally, I'll double-check that the summary is under 200 words and that all the key moral points are included. I'll make sure the language is clear and concise, accurately reflecting the article's content and moral perspective.

### SUMMARY:  
The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, despite its controversial history as an offshore holding station for refugees. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance and isolation. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship privileges. Critics highlight its moral and logistical challenges, including the treatment of prisoners and the potential to strain relations with Cuba. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has long criticized the U.S. military's presence there as illegal, while U.S. officials defend it under a 1934 treaty. The move aims to underscore the base's importance, but concerns remain about its moral implications and the comfort of prisoners. END OF SUMMARY.
