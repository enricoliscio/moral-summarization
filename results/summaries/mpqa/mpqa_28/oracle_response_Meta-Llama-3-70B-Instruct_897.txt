SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that has sparked controversy. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now house prisoners with a radically different view of the country. Despite logistical hurdles, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" to hold these prisoners, who are considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists. The base's isolated location and existing detention facilities make it an "excellent location" for housing these prisoners, according to US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The move raises concerns about the comfort and well-being of the prisoners, who will be held in a "well-planned" facility with a focus on security rather than comfort. The base has previously been used to house "traumatized" refugees from the Kosovo conflict, and its isolated location and strict military escort requirements make it a unique and secure location for holding these prisoners.
