SUMMARY: The Pentagon is planning to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision raises moral concerns about the comfort and well-being of the prisoners, as well as the safety of those involved in their detention.

The base, a curious slice of Americana in the Caribbean with amenities like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, has previously been used to detain thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking refuge in America. Now, it will hold men with a radically different view of the country, and the challenge of securely transporting them over 8,000 miles from Afghanistan is significant.

The number of prisoners is expected to be small, perhaps in the dozens, and planners are focusing on security rather than comfort. This is in stark contrast to previous plans considered by the Clinton administration in 1999, where the focus was on providing comfort to traumatized victims of civil war from Kosovo.

The base's isolation adds to the complexity of the situation. Visitors require strict military escort and prior permission from the Pentagon, and the only other access is through dangerous waters or a Cuban minefield.

The decision to use Guantanamo Bay as a prison for terrorists underscores the strategic importance of the naval base, but it also raises questions about the moral implications of detaining individuals potentially involved in violent and traumatic acts. 

END OF SUMMARY.
