SUMMARY: Pentagon's plans to use Guantanamo Bay as a prison for al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters raise moral concerns about justice, human rights, and national security. The choice of Guantanamo, a U.S. naval base in Cuba, is justified by its isolation and the fact that it is not on U.S. soil, depriving detainees of American residency rights. The base has previously held Haitian and Cuban refugees, offering a "curious slice of Americana" with amenities like a movie theater and bowling alleys. The challenge of transferring prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo underscores the moral dilemma of balancing security and the treatment of prisoners, with planners focusing on security over prisoner comfort. Guantanamo's use as a detention center for those seeking freedom in America contrasts sharply with its potential future as a prison for those accused of terrorism. Rumsfeld's dismissal of concerns about Castro's reaction reflects a pragmatic approach to national security, possibly at the expense of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The move supports the strategic importance of the naval base but may have unintended consequences in negotiations with a future democratic Cuban government.
