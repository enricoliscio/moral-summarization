SUMMARY: Pentagon plans to use Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba as a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges and moral implications. The base, with its amenities and isolation, has previously held thousands of refugees seeking freedom in America. U.S. officials emphasize its strategic importance and the fact that detainees are not entitled to American residency or citizenship privileges. The biggest challenge is transporting prisoners from Afghanistan to the Caribbean, with security and comfort considerations. Guantanamo has detention space for about 100 people and offers a curious slice of American life. The move may provoke a reaction from the Cuban government, but Rumsfeld dismisses these concerns. This decision raises moral questions about the treatment of prisoners, the use of offshore detention centers, and the potential impact on U.S.-Cuban relations.

END OF SUMMARY.
