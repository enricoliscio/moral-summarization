SUMMARY:
The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, once a beacon of freedom for thousands of refugees, is now poised to become a prison for terror prisoners with a radically different view of the country. Despite the logistical hurdle of transporting dangerous men from Afghanistan to Cuba, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld deemed Guantanamo the "least worst place." The base has a history of housing refugees and illegal migrants, and U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the idea, citing the strategic importance of the base. The biggest challenge will be ensuring the security of the prisoners, who are considered supporters of terrorists. Guantanamo offers a curious slice of America in the Caribbean, isolated from the outside world and accessible only under strict military escort. The U.S. illegally occupies the base under a lease agreement, and some consider returning the land as a potential carrot for negotiation with a democratic Cuba. While Ros-Lehtinen suggests this move may raise hackles with the Cuban government, Rumsfeld dismisses concerns of trouble with Fidel Castro. The moral framing of the article reflects a complex interplay of freedom, security, and the challenges of dealing with terror prisoners in a post-9/11 world.
