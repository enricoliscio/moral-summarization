SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced plans to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters. This decision raises moral concerns about the ethics of holding prisoners outside of U.S. soil, potentially denying them legal protections and citizenship privileges. The move is justified by the strategic importance of the base and the need to isolate dangerous individuals. The challenges include the logistical hurdles of transporting prisoners and ensuring security at the base. Guantanamo Bay, a curious slice of America in the Caribbean, offers a unique setting with its mix of military and civilian presence. The base has previously been used to hold refugees and migrants, and planners are confident in their ability to adapt to the new situation. This decision underscores the moral dilemma of balancing security needs with the rights and treatment of prisoners, especially when held outside the legal framework of U.S. soil. END OF SUMMARY.
