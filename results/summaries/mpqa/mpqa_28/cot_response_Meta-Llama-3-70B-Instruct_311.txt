SUMMARY:
The Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a move that underscores the base's strategic importance. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now hold men with a radically different view of the country. Despite logistical hurdles, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" to hold these dangerous prisoners. The move may raise concerns with the communist-ruled Cuban government, but Rumsfeld dismissed these concerns. The base, with its detention space for about 100 people, has been used to house illegal migrant detainees in the past and is considered an excellent location for this purpose. END OF SUMMARY.
