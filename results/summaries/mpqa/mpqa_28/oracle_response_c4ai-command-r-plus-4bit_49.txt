SUMMARY: The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is set to become a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision raises moral concerns regarding the comfort and welfare of the detainees, as well as the safety of those involved in their detention.

The base, a curious slice of America in the Caribbean with amenities like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, has a history of housing refugees and migrants. U.S. officials are now planning to use it to detain dangerous individuals, presumably members or supporters of a terrorist network, thousands of miles away from their capture location in Afghanistan.

The number of prisoners is expected to be small, with the focus on security rather than comfort. This is in stark contrast to previous instances where Guantanamo Bay housed traumatized victims of civil war, for whom healthcare workers and Muslim clergymen were deployed to ensure their comfort.

The move to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for terrorists underscores the base's strategic importance and isolated nature. It also raises questions about the ethics of detaining individuals outside of U.S. soil, potentially denying them the rights and privileges of American residency and citizenship.

The logistics of transporting prisoners and ensuring their secure detention at the base present significant challenges, but officials maintain that the plan is well-conceived, having been used successfully in the past for detaining illegal migrants.
