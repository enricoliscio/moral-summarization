Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo Bay becoming a prison for terrorists, preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. It mentions the logistical challenges but also the strategic importance. The moral aspects here are about the treatment of prisoners and the legality of holding them there without U.S. residency rights.

I should highlight that the base isn't on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get the same rights. Also, the historical context of it being used for Cuban and Haitian refugees adds to the moral debate. The summary needs to capture the strategic benefits versus the ethical concerns, like human rights and due process.

I'll make sure to include key points: Pentagon's decision, Rumsfeld's quote, the location's benefits, the lack of citizenship rights, historical use, and the moral implications. Keeping it concise but covering all these aspects within 200 words.

I should also mention the isolation and facilities, as well as the political stance from both the U.S. and Cuba. That way, the summary reflects the moral framing by showing both the strategic and ethical sides of the decision.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described it as "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship rights. Historically, it housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, but now it will focus on security for prisoners deemed terrorists. The move highlights moral concerns, including human rights and due process, while also underscoring Guantanamo's role as a symbol of U.S. influence in the region. END OF SUMMARY.
