Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words: comfortable, traumatized, violent, and well-planned. My goal is to include as many of these as possible in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. It mentions logistical challenges, the location's strategic importance, and the history of Guantanamo holding refugees. The author uses words like "comfortable" and "traumatized" when discussing past refugee housing, and "well-planned" regarding the current setup.

I need to ensure the summary captures these elements. I should start by stating that Guantanamo is being used again as a detention center. Mention the Pentagon's plan, Rumsfeld's view, and the strategic importance according to Ros-Lehtinen. Then, include the fact that detainees aren't entitled to U.S. residency because it's not on U.S. soil.

Next, reference the past use during the refugee crisis, highlighting that the facilities were meant to be comfortable for traumatized individuals. Now, the focus is on security for prisoners seen as violent or terrorist supporters. Note the current number of prisoners and the capacity.

Finally, mention the American amenities at Guantanamo and the debate over its legality. Conclude with Rumsfeld dismissing concerns about Castro. I need to weave in the moral words naturally without forcing them.

I'll structure the summary to flow from the announcement, historical context, current plans, and implications. Make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms where appropriate. I'll aim for clarity and brevity to stay within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved. Check the word count as I go to make sure it doesn't exceed 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, despite logistical challenges. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship rights. Previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees during crises, Guantanamo's facilities were designed to provide a comfortable environment for traumatized individuals. Now, the focus is on security for prisoners deemed violent or tied to terrorism. The Pentagon has well-planned logistics, including moving prisoners from Afghanistan, though trials or tribunals are not scheduled. The base, with amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, remains isolated, accessible only with military escort. Cuban leader Fidel Castro views the U.S. presence as illegal, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns, stating no trouble with Castro is expected. END OF SUMMARY.
