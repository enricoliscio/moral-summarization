SUMMARY: The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is set to become a detention center for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The Pentagon plans to hold these prisoners at the isolated base, which is not on U.S. soil and thus avoids residency and citizenship issues. The base has previously been used to hold Haitian and Cuban refugees and is equipped with detention space for about 100 people. The move is supported by U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who believes it underscores the base's strategic importance. The main challenge will be transporting the prisoners from Afghanistan to the Caribbean, with security a top priority. The number of prisoners is expected to be small, and they will be held separately from the base's 1,100 Navy and Marine Corps personnel and their families. Guantanamo Bay is a well-secured, isolated base with limited access, making it an ideal location for holding dangerous prisoners. While Cuba's Fidel Castro may object to the U.S. occupation of the base, Rumsfeld expects no trouble. END OF SUMMARY.
