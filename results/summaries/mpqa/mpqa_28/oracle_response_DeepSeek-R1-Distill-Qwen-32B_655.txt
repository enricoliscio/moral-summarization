Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include: comfortable, traumatized, violent, well-planned. I should make sure these words are in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. is planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. The base was previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees. The author mentions the logistical challenges, like moving prisoners from Afghanistan, and the strategic importance of the location. They also talk about the base's facilities and the political implications with Cuba.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The article uses "comfortable" in the context of planning for refugees, "traumatized" from the Kosovo conflict, "violent" referring to the prisoners' background, and "well-planned" in the setup of the base. I should incorporate these words naturally into the summary.

I'll start by stating the plan to use Guantanamo, mention the previous use for refugees, then talk about the current situation with prisoners. I'll include the logistical challenges, the mention of the 1999 plans for refugees, and the focus on security over prisoner comfort. I'll also note the facilities at the base and the political stance regarding Cuba.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence flows and includes the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced. Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral words are included.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, highlighting its strategic importance. Despite logistical challenges, such as transporting prisoners from Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place." The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees residency and citizenship rights. Previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees, it now faces a different scenario: housing prisoners considered dangerous. Planners referenced 1999 blueprints for a potential refugee crisis, focusing on comfort for traumatized victims of a violent conflict. However, this time, the focus is on security rather than comfort, with prisoners seen as part of a terrorist network. Guantanamo, with its Americana facilities like a movie theater and McDonald's, remains isolated, accessible only with military escort. Cuban leader Fidel Castro deems the base illegal, while U.S. officials cite a 1934 treaty. The move may strain relations with Cuba, but Rumsfeld downplayed concerns. The well-planned setup, drawing from past migrant detentions, aims to secure the base while housing up to 100 prisoners. END OF SUMMARY.
