SUMMARY:
The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that has sparked controversy. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now hold men with a "radically different view of the country". Despite logistical hurdles, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" for the prisoners. The base's strategic importance is underscored by this move, which will also highlight its offshore location, allowing the US to detain prisoners without granting them American residency and citizenship privileges. The prisoners, considered "dangerous" and "terrorists", will be held in a secure facility, a stark contrast to the "comfortable" conditions planned for refugees in 1999. END OF SUMMARY.
