Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Guantanamo Bay being used as a prison for terrorists. I need to make sure I capture the main points. Let me read through the article first.

The article mentions that the Pentagon plans to use Guantanamo Bay to house al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. It's because it's isolated and not on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get the same rights. They're moving prisoners from Afghanistan there, which is a long distance. There's some support from a congresswoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who thinks it's a good strategic move. Also, the base has been used before for Cuban and Haitian refugees, so they have some infrastructure in place. The article also talks about the logistics of moving the prisoners and the fact that there were plans back in 1999 for refugees from Kosovo, but that didn't happen. The base is quite Americanized with places like McDonald's, but it's still isolated. Cuban leader Fidel Castro thinks the U.S. presence is illegal, but the U.S. says it's under a lease. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I should focus on the key details: the decision to use Guantanamo, reasons, support, logistics, past usage, and the political context with Cuba.

I should structure it by starting with the main announcement, then reasons why Guantanamo was chosen, mention the support from Ros-Lehtinen, the logistical challenges, the past use for refugees, the current situation with prisoners, and end with the political implications with Cuba. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The isolated naval base, not on U.S. soil, allows detainees to be held without American residency or citizenship rights. While moving prisoners from Afghanistan poses logistical challenges, Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place." U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the decision, emphasizing the base's strategic importance. Guantanamo has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees, and its infrastructure is being repurposed for this new mission. The base, with amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, is highly isolated, accessible only with military approval. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has long contested the U.S. presence there, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns of conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
