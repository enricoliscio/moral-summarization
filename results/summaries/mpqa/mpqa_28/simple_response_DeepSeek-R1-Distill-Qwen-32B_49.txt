Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo being used to hold terror prisoners. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points and the underlying moral implications.

First, the article talks about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The moral aspect here is the debate over human rights and the treatment of prisoners. I should note that the base is not on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get the same rights, which is a moral concern.

Next, the logistical challenges: moving prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, which is over 8,000 miles away. The Pentagon sees it as the "least worst place," highlighting the practicality over moral considerations.

The article mentions past uses of Guantanamo for Cuban and Haitian refugees, which shows a shift in its purpose. This might bring up moral issues about how the U.S. treats different groups.

Rep. Ros-Lehtinen supports this move to emphasize the base's strategic importance, which is a political angle but also touches on the moral justification of maintaining military presence.

The base's facilities, like the outdoor theater and McDonald's, contrast with its current use, possibly indicating a moral dilemma between a slice of Americana and a detention center.

Lastly, the lease agreement with Cuba is mentioned, with Castro arguing it's illegal. This brings up the moral debate over sovereignty and international law.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, focusing on the moral framing: the shift in Guantanamo's purpose, human rights concerns, logistical vs. moral considerations, past uses, political support, the base's facilities, and the lease debate.

I'll structure it by introducing the plan, the moral implications, past uses, political support, facilities, and the international debate. Make sure to keep it concise and highlight the moral aspects as the author presented them.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite its controversial history as a refuge for Cubans and Haitians. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," though moving prisoners from Afghanistan poses logistical challenges. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency rights, a decision with moral implications. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the move, emphasizing the base's strategic value. Guantanamo's facilities, including a McDonald's and movie theater, contrast with its new role, raising questions about its purpose shift. The base's lease agreement with Cuba, opposed by Fidel Castro, adds to the debate over its legality and morality. END OF SUMMARY.
