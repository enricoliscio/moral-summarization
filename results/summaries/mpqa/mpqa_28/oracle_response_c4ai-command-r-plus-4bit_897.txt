SUMMARY: The Pentagon is planning to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision raises moral concerns about the treatment of prisoners and the potential reaction from Cuba's government. The base, a curious slice of Americana in the Caribbean with amenities like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, has a history of housing refugees and migrants. U.S. officials are aware of the logistical challenges, including the need to transport dangerous prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The number of prisoners is expected to be small, focusing more on security than on the comfort of the traumatized prisoners. The base's isolation adds to the challenge, with strict military escorts and prior permission required for visitors. While Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the idea, highlighting the base's strategic importance, Cuba's Fidel Castro has long argued that the U.S. military occupation is illegal. This decision presents a complex moral situation, balancing the need for security with the potential for causing further trauma to already traumatized individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
