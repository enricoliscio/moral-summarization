SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, citing it as the "least worst place" despite logistical challenges. The move is seen as a strategic importance for the base, which has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees. The prisoners, estimated to be around 45, will not be entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base, which has a detention space for around 100 people, has previously been used as an offshore holding station during refugee crises. The move is supported by US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who sees it as a way to underscore the base's importance. However, the decision may raise concerns with the Cuban government, which has long argued that the US military occupation of the base is illegal.
