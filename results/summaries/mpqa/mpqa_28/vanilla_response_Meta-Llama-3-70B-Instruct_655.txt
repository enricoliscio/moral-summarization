SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The base, which has previously been used to detain Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in the US, will house the prisoners for an undetermined time. The move is seen as a strategic importance for the base, which has been considered for return to Cuba by some members of Congress. The prisoners, estimated to be around 45, will be held at the base's detention center, which has a capacity for 100 people. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from Afghanistan to the Caribbean. The base, which is not on US soil, does not offer American residency and eventual citizenship privileges to those detained there. The move is not expected to raise concerns with the Cuban government, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
