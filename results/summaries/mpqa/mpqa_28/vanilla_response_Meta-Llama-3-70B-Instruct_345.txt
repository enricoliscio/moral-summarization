SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon is planning to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The base, which has previously been used to detain thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in the US, will hold the prisoners for an undetermined time. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's strategic importance, as some members of Congress have urged returning the territory to Cuba. The prisoners will not be entitled to American residency and eventual citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The logistics of moving the prisoners from Afghanistan to Cuba will be a challenge, but the Pentagon has experience using the base as an offshore holding station. The number of prisoners is expected to be in the dozens, and the focus will be on security rather than comfort.
