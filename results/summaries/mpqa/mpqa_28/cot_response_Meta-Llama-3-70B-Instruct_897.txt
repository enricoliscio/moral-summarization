SUMMARY:
The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move supported by US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who sees it as a way to underscore the base's strategic importance. The base, which has previously housed Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now hold men with a radically different view of the country. Despite logistical challenges, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld calls Cuba "the least worst place" to hold these dangerous prisoners. The base's isolated location and existing detention facilities make it an excellent choice, with a focus on security rather than comfort for the prisoners. The move may raise concerns with the Cuban government, but Rumsfeld dismisses these concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
