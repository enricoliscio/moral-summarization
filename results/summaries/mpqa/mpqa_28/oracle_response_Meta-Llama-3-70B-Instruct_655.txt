SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that may raise concerns with the Cuban government. The base, which has previously held thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now detain men with a radically different view of the country. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" to hold these prisoners, citing the logistical challenges of moving them 8,000 miles from Afghanistan. The prisoners will not be entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges since the base is not on US soil. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's strategic importance, with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen saying it "gives new life to Gitmo." The base has previously been used to house traumatized victims of civil war, but this time the focus will be on security rather than comfort. The Pentagon has pulled out 1999 plans to house refugees, but this time the concern is housing terrorists and supporters of terrorists in a "well-planned" operation.
