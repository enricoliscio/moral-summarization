SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that has sparked controversy. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now house men with a radically different view of the country. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" to hold the prisoners, citing logistical hurdles and security concerns. The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's strategic importance, despite concerns from Cuba's government, which has long argued that the US military occupation of the base is illegal. The prisoners, considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists, will be held in a detention space designed for about 100 people. The base, a curious slice of Americana on the edge of the Caribbean, has been used to house illegal migrant detainees in the past, including Cubans and Haitians, and has a "well-planned" infrastructure in place to handle the new arrivals.
