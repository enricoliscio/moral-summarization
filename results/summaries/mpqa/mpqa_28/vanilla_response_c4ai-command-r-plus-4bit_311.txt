SUMMARY: The Pentagon plans to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters. The base, located on the isolated eastern coast of Cuba, has been used in the past to detain thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking refuge in America. The decision to use Guantanamo Bay as a prison for these prisoners presents logistical challenges, but Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld considers it "the least worst place." The base is not on U.S. soil, which means detainees are not entitled to American residency or citizenship privileges. The number of prisoners expected to arrive is small, with the focus being on security rather than comfort. Guantanamo Bay is a well-isolated base with strict access control, and it has previously been used to hold illegal migrants, providing a blueprint for the current plan. The base offers a slice of American life with amenities like an outdoor movie theater, bowling alleys, and a McDonald's. Its remote location makes it difficult to access, and visitors require military escort and prior permission from the Pentagon. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has disputed the legality of the U.S. military occupation of the base, but Rumsfeld does not anticipate any issues with the Cuban government. END OF SUMMARY.
