SUMMARY: The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is set to become a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This move raises moral concerns regarding the treatment of prisoners and the logistics of holding them in a secure yet comfortable and well-planned environment. The base, a curious slice of America in the Caribbean with amenities like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, has previously been used to house refugees and migrants. Now, it will hold men with a radically different view of the country, and the challenge will be to balance security with the need to provide a trauma-informed approach to those who have experienced or supported violent acts. The biggest hurdle may be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean, and ensuring their detention is both secure and humane. Guantanamo Bay has the space and experience to handle this situation, having previously held migrants in a well-planned manner, and will now apply that expertise to a different, more challenging group of detainees.
