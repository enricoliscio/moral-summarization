SUMMARY:
The U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, once a detention center for thousands of refugees seeking freedom, is now set to become a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters. Despite the logistical challenges of transferring prisoners from Afghanistan to Cuba, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld considers Cuba the "least worst place." The base provides the strategic advantage of not being on U.S. soil, thus detainees are not entitled to American residency or citizenship privileges. Guantanamo has previously been used to hold Haitian and Cuban refugees, offering a curious slice of America in the Caribbean. 

While the base offers comforts like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, the focus of housing terrorists will be on security rather than comfort. The U.S. plans to transfer a small number of prisoners, considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists, to Guantanamo. This move has been supported by U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who believes it underscores the base's strategic importance and gives "new life" to Guantanamo. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has argued that the U.S. military occupation of the base is illegal, a view dismissed by Rumsfeld, who anticipates no trouble with Castro.
