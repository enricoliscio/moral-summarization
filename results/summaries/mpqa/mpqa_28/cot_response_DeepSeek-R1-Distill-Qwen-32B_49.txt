Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task involves two main steps: first, identifying morally framed words in a provided news article, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral framings. 

Starting with the first step, I need to read through the article carefully to pick out words that carry moral connotations. I should look for terms that imply judgment, value, or ethical considerations. For example, words like "prisoners," "detention," "terrorism," and "illegal" might carry moral weight because they relate to justice, human rights, and legality.

Moving on to the second step, I have to summarize the article in a concise manner, ensuring that the moral framing is maintained. This means using the identified words where appropriate to reflect the author's perspective. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the Pentagon's decision to use Guantanamo, the logistical challenges, the moral implications of detaining prisoners without U.S. soil benefits, and the strategic importance mentioned by Ros-Lehtinen.

I should also consider the context of Guantanamo's history as a detention center, which adds to the moral framing. Highlighting that the base is not on U.S. soil and thus denies certain rights to detainees is crucial for maintaining the moral perspective. Additionally, mentioning the plans from 1999 and the current situation helps show the continuity and the different contexts in which Guantanamo has been used.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the decision to house prisoners, then the logistical aspects, followed by the moral implications, and ending with the strategic importance and the dismissal of Cuban concerns. Keeping each sentence focused and concise will help stay within the word limit.

Lastly, I should review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the original article's moral framing without adding personal bias. The goal is to present a neutral yet morally aware summary that aligns with the author's original intent.

**SUMMARY:**  

The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship privileges. It has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees. While some, like Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, support the move, others question its morality. The base’s history as an offshore detention site and its role in housing illegal migrants are noted. Guantanamo’s isolation and facilities, including an outdoor movie theater and McDonald’s, highlight its unique Americana feel. Cuban leader Fidel Castro condemns the U.S. presence, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns, stating no major issues are anticipated.
