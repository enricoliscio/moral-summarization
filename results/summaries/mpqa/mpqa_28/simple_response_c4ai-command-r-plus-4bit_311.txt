SUMMARY: Pentagon's plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a prison for al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters spark debate. Despite logistical challenges and moral concerns, supporters argue it underscores the naval base's strategic importance and provides a secure location for detention. The base's isolation and legal status outside U.S. soil are seen as advantages, with past experience housing refugees and detainees. Critics worry about potential backlash from Cuba's government and the ethical implications of holding prisoners outside U.S. jurisdiction. Rumsfeld dismisses concerns, stating Cuba is the "least worst place." The move raises questions about the treatment of prisoners, comfort, and security, with military sources indicating a focus on security over prisoner comfort. Guantanamo Bay, a slice of America in the Caribbean, provides a unique and isolated location for the detention of these prisoners.
