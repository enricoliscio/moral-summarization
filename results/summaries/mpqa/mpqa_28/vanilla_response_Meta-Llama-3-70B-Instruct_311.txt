SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to house captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The base, which has previously held Cuban and Haitian refugees, will be used to detain the prisoners for an undetermined time. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" for the detention center, citing its strategic importance and the fact that it is not on US soil, meaning detainees are not entitled to American residency and citizenship privileges. The prisoners are expected to arrive in weeks, and there are no plans to stage military tribunals or trials at the base. The biggest challenge will be transporting the prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. The base has detention space for about 100 people and has previously been used to house illegal migrant detainees.
