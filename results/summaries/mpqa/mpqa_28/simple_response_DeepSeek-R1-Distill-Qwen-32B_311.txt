Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo Bay being used to hold terrorism suspects. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Guantanamo Bay, which was once a detention center for Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom, might now hold al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The Pentagon's plan is to move prisoners there despite the long distance. Rumsfeld calls it the "least worst place," which implies it's not ideal but better than alternatives. That's a moral point about the necessity despite imperfection.

Rep. Ros-Lehtinen supports the plan, highlighting the base's strategic importance and giving it new life. She's framing it as beneficial for the US, which is a positive spin. The article also notes that detainees aren't entitled to American residency, which touches on legal and moral issues of their status.

The base's history as an offshore holding station is mentioned, showing it's been used before for refugees. Now, it's for prisoners, which shifts its purpose. The focus is on security over comfort, treating them as threats, not victims. This raises moral questions about their treatment and rights.

The summary needs to include the move of prisoners, Rumsfeld's reasoning, the strategic importance, the legal status of detainees, the base's history, and the shift in its use. I should keep it under 200 words, using the moral elements like necessity, strategic value, and the ethical implications of detainment without US rights.

I'll structure the summary to first state the plan, mention Rumsfeld's view, the support from Ros-Lehtinen, the legal status, the historical context, the focus on security, and the moral implications. I'll end with the potential tension with Cuba and Rumsfeld's dismissal of concerns.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's concise. I'll make sure each point is clear and the moral framing is evident without being too biased.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its isolation and strategic importance. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the move, highlighting its role in reaffirming the base's significance. Guantanamo, not U.S. soil, denies detainees American residency and citizenship rights. Previously used for Haitian and Cuban refugees, the base now faces a shift in purpose, focusing on security over prisoner comfort. The move raises ethical questions about detention conditions and the treatment of suspected terrorists. Rumsfeld dismissed concerns about Cuban opposition, stating no major issues were anticipated. END OF SUMMARY.
