Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Guantanamo Bay becoming a prison for terrorists. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that the Pentagon plans to use Guantanamo Bay to house al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. I should note that it's despite the logistical challenges of moving them from Afghanistan. The location is described as "the least worst place" by Rumsfeld, and it's not on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship.

Next, the article talks about the base's history, holding Cubans and Haitians in the past. It also mentions that the prisoners won't be tried there, and the move is supported by some Congress members for strategic importance. The base's isolation and facilities are described, including its American amenities. Lastly, the political implications with Cuba are touched upon, with Rumsfeld downplaying concerns.

I need to condense all this into a clear, concise summary without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure to include the main points: the plan, logistical aspects, legal status, historical context, support, facilities, and political implications.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Despite logistical challenges, Rumsfeld called the location "the least worst place" due to its isolation and strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, means detainees won't receive residency or citizenship privileges. Guantanamo has previously housed Cuban and Haitian refugees. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the plan, highlighting the base's strategic value. Prisoners are expected to arrive in weeks, with no plans for trials at the site. The base, home to about 1,100 military personnel, has facilities for up to 100 detainees. Its isolation and American amenities, like a movie theater and McDonald's, make it unique. Cuban leader Fidel Castro considers the base's existence illegal, but Rumsfeld dismissed concerns of conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
