SUMMARY: The Pentagon is planning to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a prison for captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision raises moral concerns about the treatment of prisoners and the challenges of transferring them to the isolated base. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the idea, citing the strategic importance of the base. The article highlights the comfort and trauma of previous refugees held at the base, underscoring the moral dilemma of housing violent detainees. The base offers a curious slice of America with amenities like an outdoor movie theater and bowling alleys, but it is extremely isolated. The move is expected to be logistically challenging, with prisoners being transferred from South Asia to the Caribbean. The well-planned nature of the operation is emphasized, drawing on past experiences of housing refugees and detainees. The article also mentions the potential diplomatic implications with Cuba, but Rumsfeld dismisses concerns about Fidel Castro. Guantanamo Bay is seen as a "least worst place" to hold these prisoners, raising questions about the morality of their detention.
