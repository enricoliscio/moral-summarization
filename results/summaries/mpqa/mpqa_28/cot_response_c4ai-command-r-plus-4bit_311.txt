SUMMARY:
The Pentagon plans to hold terror prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base in Cuba, marking a shift from its previous role as a refuge for Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld referred to Cuba as the "least worst place" to detain al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters, acknowledging the logistical challenges of transporting dangerous prisoners from Afghanistan to the Caribbean. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the idea, emphasizing the base's strategic importance and its isolation from U.S. soil, which negates residency and citizenship privileges for detainees. Guantanamo has a history of housing refugees, with plans in 1999 to accommodate Kosovar refugees, but the focus now is on security rather than the comfort of prisoners who are accused of being supporters of a terrorist network. The base itself is a slice of America in the Caribbean, with amenities like a movie theater and bowling alleys, but it is highly secure and isolated. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has challenged the legality of the U.S. military occupation, while U.S. officials cite a lease agreement from a 1934 treaty. Returning the land to a democratic Cuba may be a future negotiation point. The move to use Guantanamo for terror prisoners underscores the complex moral and logistical challenges faced by governments in addressing global terrorism while balancing security with humane treatment of detainees.
