SUMMARY: The Pentagon plans to detain captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. This decision presents logistical challenges, as the prisoners will have to be transported thousands of miles from Afghanistan to the isolated Caribbean island. The base has previously been used to hold Haitian and Cuban refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. and has detention space for about 100 people. The move is supported by U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who believes it underscores the naval base's strategic importance. The Guantanamo Bay base offers a unique blend of American amenities and Caribbean isolation, with strict military control over access. The decision to use the base for detention has sparked debate over its legality, with Cuban leader Fidel Castro claiming it as illegal occupation. Washington diplomats view the base as a potential bargaining chip with a future democratic Cuban government. The U.S. maintains that the base is legally leased under a 1934 treaty with Cuba.
