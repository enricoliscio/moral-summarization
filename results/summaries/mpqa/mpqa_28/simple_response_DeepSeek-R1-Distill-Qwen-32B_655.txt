Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the U.S. planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners. It mentions that the base was previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees. The Pentagon sees it as the "least worst place" despite logistical challenges.

I should note the moral aspects here. The author highlights that the base isn't on U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship. This raises concerns about their rights. Also, the base's history as a refugee center is contrasted with its new role as a prison for terrorists, which might be seen as a shift from helping to detaining.

I need to capture that the decision is strategic but has moral implications, like the treatment of prisoners and the base's symbolic importance. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include these points.

Let me structure it: Start with the Pentagon's plan, mention the location's strategic importance, the moral dilemma of not granting residency, the historical context of the base, and the concerns about the detainees' treatment and international relations.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure to include that the base is isolated, the number of prisoners is small, and the logistical focus is on security. Also, touch on the debate about the base's legality and its use as a bargaining chip with Cuba.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that flows well, hits all the key points, and reflects the moral considerations presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The U.S. plans to use Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a detention center for captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, despite logistical challenges. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it "the least worst place," emphasizing its strategic importance. The base, not on U.S. soil, denies detainees residency and citizenship rights. Previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees, it now faces criticism for housing prisoners seen as threats. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supports the move, highlighting its strategic value. The base's isolation and history as an offshore detention site raise moral concerns about detainees' treatment and the potential for military tribunals. The plan contrasts with past efforts to assist refugees, sparking debates over human rights and international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
