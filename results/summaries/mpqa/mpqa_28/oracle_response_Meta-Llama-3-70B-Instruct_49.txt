SUMMARY:

The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that may raise concerns with the Cuban government. The base, which has previously housed thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now detain men with a radically different view of the country. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called Cuba "the least worst place" to hold the prisoners, citing the logistical challenge of moving them 8,000 miles from Afghanistan. The base's isolated location and existing detention facilities make it an "excellent location" for housing the prisoners, according to US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The move may also underscore the base's strategic importance, which has been questioned by some members of Congress. The prisoners, considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists, will not be entitled to American residency and eventual citizenship privileges. The base's planners are focusing on security, rather than the comfort of the prisoners, who will be housed in a detention space that can accommodate about 100 people.
