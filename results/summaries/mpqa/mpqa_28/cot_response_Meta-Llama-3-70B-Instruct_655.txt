SUMMARY:
The US Pentagon plans to hold captured al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, a move that has sparked controversy. The base, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, will now house dozens of "dangerous" men with a "radically different view" of the country. Despite logistical hurdles, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld calls Cuba "the least worst place" due to its "strategic importance" and "excellent location." The move is seen as a way to underscore the base's importance, which has been questioned by some members of Congress. The prisoners, considered "terrorists" or "supporters of terrorists," will be held in a detention center with a focus on "security" rather than "comfort." END OF SUMMARY.
