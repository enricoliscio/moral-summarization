Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Guantanamo Bay being used to hold terror prisoners. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that the U.S. is planning to use Guantanamo Bay as a prison for al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. It was previously used for Cuban and Haitian refugees. The base is in Cuba, which is not U.S. soil, so detainees don't get residency or citizenship. The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, calls it the "least worst place." A congresswoman supports this move, highlighting its strategic importance and giving new life to the base.

Logistical challenges include moving prisoners from Afghanistan, which is 8,000 miles away. Some prisoners are on warships or in Kandahar. The base can hold about 100 people, and there are no plans for trials there. The base has amenities like a movie theater and McDonald's, and it's isolated, requiring special permission to visit. Cuba's leader Fidel Castro considers the base's presence illegal, but U.S. officials say it's under a lease from a 1934 treaty.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: purpose of the base, logistical challenges, support from officials, the fact it's not U.S. soil, past uses, and the political context with Cuba.

I should structure it to first state the plan, then the reasons, challenges, and context. Make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.
