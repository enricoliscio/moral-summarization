Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the original article's ethical perspective. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The US released its annual human rights report, but it's facing criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report is seen as a ritual without real impact, and the US isn't holding its allies accountable while criticizing others. 

I notice the author uses terms like hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, and others. I need to include as many of these morally charged words as possible in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying key points: the release of the report, criticism for hypocrisy, treatment of allies, the report's focus on other countries, domestic criticism, and the US's lack of action on Saudi Arabia despite its poor record. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the US's double standards and the perceived unfairness of not examining their own human rights situation. Also, the lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia is a point of contention.

I'll make sure to mention the annual report, the hypocrisy charges, the treatment of allies, the focus on other countries, and the US's failure to address its own issues. I'll also include the criticism from the media and the lack of visible actions in Saudi Arabia.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise (under 200 words) and includes the morally framed words. I'll avoid adding new information and stick to the article's content, preserving the original framing.

SUMMARY: The US annual human rights report, released amid charges of hypocrisy and double standards, faced widespread skepticism and scorn, particularly due to its lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Critics accused the report, mandated by Congress, of becoming a meaningless ritual, especially as the US curtailed civil liberties domestically while claiming to promote human rights globally. The report, which does not examine the US's own human rights record, focuses on alleged violations in other countries, with India's report exceeding 100 pages. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries, received only 32 pages. US officials struggled to defend their policy, emphasizing their efforts to promote democracy and human rights in countries like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan but failing to provide tangible actions in Saudi Arabia. Critics highlighted the duplicity of criticizing some nations while overlooking allies, questioning the fairness and evenhandedness of the report. The US's reluctance to hold its funded allies accountable, such as Egypt and Turkey, further eroded the report's credibility. END OF SUMMARY.
