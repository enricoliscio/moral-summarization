SUMMARY: The US's annual human rights report faced unprecedented skepticism and criticism for its perceived hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report, which excludes the US's human rights record, was criticized for its selective focus and lenient treatment of certain countries. At a briefing, officials struggled to defend the report and US policy, facing sharp questions about tangible actions taken to promote human rights in Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out the discrepancy between the treatment of democratic countries like India and autocratic allies. The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, Lorne Craner, faced tough questions and struggled to provide specific examples of US efforts in Saudi Arabia. Critics noted that previous administrations had also talked about human rights with the Saudis without visible results. The exchange highlighted the perceived lack of progress and transparency in US human rights policy towards certain countries.
