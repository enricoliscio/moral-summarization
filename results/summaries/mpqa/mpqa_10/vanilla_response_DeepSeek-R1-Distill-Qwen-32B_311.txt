Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which has caused a lot of criticism. People are saying the US is hypocritical because it's not holding its allies, like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, to the same standards. 

The report itself doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. It details other countries' issues, like India having a 100-page report. But countries like Saudi Arabia only get 32 pages, even though they're considered one of the least free. The US is accused of not punishing its allies even when they have bad records. 

At a press briefing, Assistant Secretary Craner tried to defend the US's approach. He mentioned programs in other countries but was vague about Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out that the US talks about promoting democracy but doesn't take concrete actions, especially with allies. The report's credibility is questioned because of this double standard.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the release of the report, criticism of hypocrisy, the lack of self-examination by the US, the detailed reports on some countries vs. allies, and the press conference where the US's approach was questioned.

Let me structure it: Start with the release and the criticism. Mention the hypocrisy and double standards. Note that the US doesn't examine its own human rights. Highlight the contrast in report lengths. Then, describe the press conference where Craner was vague about Saudi Arabia and the criticism that followed. End with the impact on the report's credibility.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Also, keep it under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I write.
