Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a judgment or imply a value, like "hypocrisy," "double standards," or "abuses." They're used to convey a moral stance or critique.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence and pick out these words. Words like "scepticism," "scorn," "hypocrisy," "double standards," "kid glove treatment," "withering scrutiny," "unfair," "curtailment," "meaningless," "glossing over," "duplicity," "glib," "worst violator," "tangible," and "secret" all seem to carry moral judgment.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: the US releasing a human rights report, the criticism for hypocrisy, the treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia, the lack of action, and the media's questioning.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the criticism, the hypocrisy, the scrutiny of allies, and the lack of tangible actions, ensuring that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

**STEP 1:**  
* Scepticism  
* Scorn  
* Hypocrisy  
* Double standards  
* Kid glove treatment  
* Withering scrutiny  
* Unfair  
* Curtailment  
* Meaningless  
* Glossing over  
* Duplicity  
* Glib  
* Worst violator  
* Tangible  
* Secret  

**SUMMARY:**  
The US released its annual human rights report, sparking widespread scepticism and scorn due to accusations of hypocrisy and double standards, especially amid the war on terrorism. Critics highlighted Washington's lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while the report subjected these countries to withering scrutiny. Domestically, concerns over civil liberties curtailment added to the criticism. The report, which does not examine human rights within the US, was labelled increasingly meaningless, as it glossed over allies' records. Countries like Saudi Arabia received minimal attention, while nations like India faced extensive scrutiny. Media critics sharply questioned the US's duplicity, pointing out its failure to hold allies accountable. Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner struggled to defend the policy, offering vague examples of efforts in countries like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan but failing to provide tangible actions for Saudi Arabia. The report's credibility was further undermined by its lack of focus on the US's own human rights record and its selective approach to promoting democracy and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
