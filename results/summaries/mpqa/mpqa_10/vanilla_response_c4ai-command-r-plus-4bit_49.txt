SUMMARY: The release of the US's annual human rights report was met with skepticism and criticism for its perceived hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report, which is mandated by Congress, has been deemed a meaningless ritual by many as it does not address human rights violations in the US and glosses over the records of its allies. Critics questioned the US's commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in these countries, specifically Saudi Arabia. Lorne Craner, US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, struggled to defend American policy, citing examples of their work in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, he faced intense scrutiny over the lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia. Craner claimed that the US was talking to the Saudi government about human rights issues but could not provide specific details. Critics pointed out that previous administrations had also made similar claims with little to no effect. The exchange highlighted the perceived inconsistency in US foreign policy and the difficulty in balancing strategic interests with human rights concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
