SUMMARY:
The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with scorn and scepticism due to its hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, while its criticism of countries like India has been deemed duplicitous. The US has been accused of curtailment of civil liberties at home, making its human rights report seem like a meaningless ritual. The report's authors have struggled to defend their methodology, with Assistant Secretary Craner's glib answers failing to convince the press corps. The US has been accused of promoting democracy and human rights in some countries, but not in others, like Saudi Arabia, which has one of the worst human rights records in the world. The report has been criticized for its lack of tangible advances in promoting human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia. END OF SUMMARY.
