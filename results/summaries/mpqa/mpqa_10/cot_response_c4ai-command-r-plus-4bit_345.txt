SUMMARY: The United States' annual human rights report has been met with scepticism and scorn, with critics charging the country with hypocrisy and double standards in its war on terrorism. The report, which does not include an evaluation of human rights in the US itself, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while countries like India are scrutinized in detail. The US officials have struggled to defend their country's position, facing tough questions about their inaction on allies with poor human rights records. Critics have pointed out the US's failure to address human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, despite its status as one of the least free countries globally. The US response has been vague, with no tangible actions or outcomes presented. This has led to accusations of hypocrisy and secrecy in the US's approach to human rights, especially when dealing with its allies. The credibility of the report is further diminished by the US's own curtailment of civil liberties, raising questions about the fairness and evenhandedness of its human rights assessments. END OF SUMMARY.
