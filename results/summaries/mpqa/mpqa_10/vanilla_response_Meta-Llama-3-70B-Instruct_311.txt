SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, which has been met with skepticism and criticism due to perceived hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but critics argue that the US is lenient towards its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, is only 32 pages long, whereas countries like India receive a more detailed report. US officials struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner being questioned about the US's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Craner's responses were deemed evasive, and he failed to provide tangible examples of US efforts to improve human rights in the country.
