Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the US human rights report and specified that I need to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also listed the morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is met with criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially in the context of the war on terrorism. The report doesn't cover the US itself, which some find unfair. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are treated leniently, while others like India are scrutinized more. The article also includes a press briefing where US officials struggle to defend their policies, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia.

Next, I should identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, treatment, mandated, ritual, curtailment, evenhanded, fair, violations, assistance, duplicity, help, fund, democracy, rights, voice, participation, democratic, issues, problem are important. I need to make sure these are included in the summary.

I need to condense the article into a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating that the US report faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding allies. Mention the war on terrorism context. Note that the US doesn't evaluate its own human rights situation, which is seen as unfair. Highlight the scrutiny of India versus lenient treatment of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Include the media criticism about domestic civil liberties and the struggle to appear evenhanded. Then, summarize the press briefing where officials were questioned about their lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia and their defense, pointing out the administration's hope for future progress without specifics.

I should ensure that all the key moral terms are included without making the summary too verbose. I'll structure it to flow logically, covering the release of the report, the criticism, the specifics of the scrutiny, and the press briefing. Finally, I'll make sure the summary ends with the specified tokens and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US annual human rights report, released amid accusations of hypocrisy and double standards, faced widespread skepticism, particularly due to its lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the war on terrorism. Critics accused the report, mandated by Congress, of becoming a meaningless ritual, especially as it avoids examining human rights within the US, deeming it "unfair." The report meticulously documents violations in countries like India but glosses over allies' records, leading to questions about its evenhandedness. Media scrutiny highlighted the US's failure to hold allies accountable while criticizing others, raising concerns about duplicity. During a press briefing, US officials struggled to justify their approach, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia, where tangible efforts to promote democracy and human rights remained elusive. The report's credibility was further undermined by its treatment of countries like Pakistan, where progress was noted, while Saudi Arabia, a notorious human rights violator, received minimal attention. The administration's vague promises of future progress failed to address critics' concerns about the lack of concrete actions. END OF SUMMARY.
