SUMMARY: The US Department of State released its annual human rights report, which was met with skepticism and criticism for its perceived double standards and hypocrisy. The report, mandated by Congress, has been accused of glossing over the human rights records of US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan while scrutinizing other countries like India. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Lorne Cramer, faced tough questions from the media regarding the report's credibility and the US government's efforts to promote human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out the lack of visible action by the US to address human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, despite acknowledging its poor record. Cramer defended the report and US policy, stating that they are engaging with the Saudi government and other countries in the Muslim world to promote democratic reforms. The exchange highlighted the perceived inconsistencies in US foreign policy and the challenges faced by the US in balancing its strategic interests with its commitment to human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
