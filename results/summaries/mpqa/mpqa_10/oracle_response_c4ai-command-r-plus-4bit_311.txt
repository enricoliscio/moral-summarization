SUMMARY: The annual US human rights report has been met with scepticism and charges of hypocrisy and double standards. Critics argue that the report, which does not include an assessment of human rights in the US itself, glosses over the records of its so-called allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan while berating countries less relevant to US interests. At a briefing, US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, Lorne Craner, struggled to defend American policy and was questioned sharply on the lack of action in Saudi Arabia. Craner argued that the US is talking to the Saudi government about human rights issues, but critics pointed out that this is nothing new and that there is no visible outcome. The report, mandated by Congress, is meant to be linked to US foreign assistance but is increasingly seen as a meaningless ritual as Washington continues to prioritise its strategic interests over evenhanded treatment of human rights violations. The US has been accused of using the war on terrorism as an excuse to curtail civil liberties at home while ignoring the actions of its allies abroad. Critics argue that the report exemplifies the country's double standards and selective assistance when it comes to issues of democracy and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
