SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, which has been met with skepticism and criticism due to perceived hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but critics argue that the US is glossing over the records of its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on Saudi Arabia, for instance, is only 32 pages long, despite the country being one of the least free in the world. US officials struggled to defend American policy, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner being questioned about the country's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Craner's responses were seen as evasive and unclear, with critics pointing out that the US has shown no inclination to punish its allies for human rights violations.
