SUMMARY: The United States' annual human rights report has been met with scepticism and scorn, with critics charging the country with hypocrisy and double standards in the war on terrorism. The report, which does not include the US itself, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while showing less leniency towards countries like India. Amid domestic criticism over the curtailment of civil liberties, US officials struggled to defend their human rights report as evenhanded and fair. The report, a compendium of alleged human rights violations, lists incidents of violations by both governments and non-state groups. However, critics note that the US has shown little inclination to punish allies with poor human rights records, such as Egypt and Turkey, while berating less relevant countries. The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour faced sharp questioning at a briefing, struggling to outline tangible actions and defend the US approach to countries like Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed to previous administrations' efforts and questioned the secrecy and lack of progress. The US response to allies' human rights violations remains a contentious issue, with critics demanding more transparency and meaningful action. END OF SUMMARY.
