Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the US released its annual human rights report, but it's getting a lot of criticism. People are calling it hypocritical because the US is fighting the war on terrorism but is treating its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan gently. The report is supposed to be an annual exercise mandated by Congress, but many think it's becoming meaningless.

The US officials are trying to convince the press that the report is fair, but there's a lot of criticism domestically about civil liberties being cut back. The report doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation because, as one official said, "that wouldn't be fair." The reports on other countries are detailed, like India's being over 100 pages, listing government and group violations. But for allies like Saudi Arabia, the report is much shorter, only 32 pages, even though Saudi Arabia is one of the least free countries.

Critics are pointing out that the US isn't punishing its allies like Egypt and Turkey but is criticizing other countries. During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner struggled to answer questions about what the US is doing in Saudi Arabia to promote democracy and human rights. He mentioned talking to the government but didn't provide concrete examples, leading to more criticism about the report's credibility and the US's double standards.

So, the main points are:
1. The US released its human rights report, but it's facing criticism for hypocrisy.
2. Allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are treated leniently, leading to accusations of double standards.
3. The report is detailed for some countries but brief for allies, causing质疑.
4. US officials can't provide tangible actions in Saudi Arabia, leading to questions about the report's effectiveness and the US's commitment to promoting human rights in its allies.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the key criticisms and the US's response.

The US annual human rights report, released amid criticism of hypocrisy and double standards, has drawn scrutiny for its lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the war on terrorism. Critics argue the report, which details human rights violations in other countries, lacks credibility due to its brevity on allies and failure to address the US's own record. While countries like India receive extensive coverage, Saudi Arabia, a major rights violator, is barely addressed in 32 pages. US officials, struggling to defend the report's fairness, have not provided concrete examples of efforts to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia, leading to questions about the report's effectiveness and the US's commitment to human rights in its alliances. END OF SUMMARY.
