SUMMARY: The annual release of the US human rights report has been met with scepticism and accusations of hypocrisy, with critics pointing out the US's lenient treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Despite widespread criticism of the curtailment of civil liberties, US officials defended the report as evenhanded, while also arguing that including the US in the report "wouldn't be fair." The report, which focuses on alleged human rights violations in other countries, has lost its relevance as Washington continues to ignore the records of its allies. While countries like India are scrutinized extensively, others like Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries, receive minimal attention. The US's failure to hold its bankrolled allies accountable, such as Egypt and Turkey, further underscores the double standards applied by the US. During a briefing, Assistant Secretary Craner struggled to answer questions regarding concrete actions taken by the US to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the administration's lack of transparency and accountability in addressing human rights issues with its allies. Critics argue that the US's selective approach undermines the credibility of the report and raises questions about its commitment to upholding human rights globally.
END OF SUMMARY.
