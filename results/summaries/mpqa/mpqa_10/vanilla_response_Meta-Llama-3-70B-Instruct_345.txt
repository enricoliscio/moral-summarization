SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, which has been met with skepticism and criticism due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but critics argue that the US is lenient towards its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, is only 32 pages long, while countries like India receive more scrutiny. US officials struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner facing tough questions from the press corps. Craner was unable to provide concrete examples of US efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, leading to accusations of duplicity. The report's credibility has been questioned, with many countries taking it less seriously due to the US's perceived double standards.
