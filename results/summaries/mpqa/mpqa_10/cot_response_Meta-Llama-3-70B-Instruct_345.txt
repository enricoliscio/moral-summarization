SUMMARY:
The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with scorn and hypocrisy accusations due to its kid-glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report's credibility is questioned as it glosses over the human rights records of these countries, while being critical of others. The US officials struggled to defend their policy, with Assistant Secretary Craner's glib answers failing to convince the press corps. The report's duplicitous nature is evident in its 32-page coverage of Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, compared to the 100-page report on India. The US is accused of promoting democracy and human rights in some countries, but not in others, sparking criticism and scrutiny. The report's moral credibility is at stake, and its effectiveness in promoting human rights is doubtful. END OF SUMMARY.
