Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about the US releasing its annual human rights report, but it's getting a lot of criticism. People are saying the US is hypocritical because it's treating its allies, like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, softly while criticizing other countries. The report itself doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. 

There's mention of the report being a mandated ritual by Congress, but it's becoming meaningless. Domestically, there's criticism about civil liberties being curtailed. US officials are trying to convince the press that the report is evenhanded, but it's not convincing everyone.

The report details human rights violations in other countries, like India, but countries like Saudi Arabia, which have bad records, get less attention. The US isn't punishing its allies like Egypt and Turkey, which makes the report seem hypocritical. 

During the briefing, the Assistant Secretary is questioned about what the US is doing in Saudi Arabia, but the answers are vague. The US is funding projects in other countries but not showing much in Saudi Arabia. The article ends with critics questioning the US's duplicity and the effectiveness of its policies.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible: hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, treatment, mandated, ritual, curtailment, evenhanded, fair, violations, violation, assistance, duplicity, help, fund, democracy, rights, voice, participation, do, democratic, issues, problem.

I should structure the summary to highlight the hypocrisy and double standards in the US's human rights report. Mention the treatment of allies, the mandated report being a ritual, the curtailment of civil liberties, the evenhandedness claim, the violations listed, the assistance given to some but not others, the duplicity in policy, and the lack of tangible actions in countries like Saudi Arabia. Emphasize the moral issues like democracy, rights, voice, participation, and the problems with the US's approach.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well. Let me start drafting:

The US annual human rights report has faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report, mandated by Congress, is increasingly seen as a meaningless ritual. Domestically, there's concern over curtailment of civil liberties, while US officials claim the report is evenhanded. However, the report doesn't examine the US's own human rights situation, deeming it unfair. It details violations in countries like India but gives less attention to allies with poor records. The US assists some countries but doesn't hold allies accountable, leading to accusations of duplicity. During a briefing, officials struggled to provide tangible actions in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the problem of promoting democracy and rights without concrete steps. The report's credibility is questioned, emphasizing the moral issues of selective treatment and lack of commitment to global human rights standards.

Wait, that's a bit over. Let me trim it down, ensuring all key points are covered concisely.
