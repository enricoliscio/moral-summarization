Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should highlight the ethical issues presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the provided news article to understand the main points. The article talks about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding their allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report doesn't include the US's own human rights situation, which is a point of contention. There's also mention of how the report is seen as a ritual with little impact, and the US's reluctance to criticize its allies while criticizing others.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing. The article emphasizes the US's hypocrisy in criticizing other countries while overlooking their allies' human rights issues. The double standards and the lack of action to improve human rights in key ally countries are the main moral issues here.

I should make sure the summary captures the criticism of the US's approach, the lack of tangible actions in countries like Saudi Arabia, and the perception that the report is becoming meaningless. Also, highlighting that the US doesn't assess its own human rights situation adds to the moral critique.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the release of the report and the criticism it received. Then, I'll note the double standards, the lack of action towards allies, and the internal contradictions within the US's policies. Finally, I'll include the media's questioning and the administration's vague responses, showing the lack of concrete steps.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's a clear, moral summary without losing the essence of the original article. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward to convey the ethical concerns effectively.

SUMMARY:  
The US annual human rights report, released amid widespread criticism, has been accused of hypocrisy and double standards, particularly in its treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the war on terrorism. Critics argue that the report, which highlights human rights abuses in other countries while exempting the US, lacks credibility due to Washington's lenient approach toward its allies. For instance, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's least free nations, received minimal scrutiny, while countries like India faced extensive criticism. US officials struggled to defend the report's impartiality, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner failing to provide concrete examples of efforts to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia. The report, originally tied to foreign assistance, is increasingly seen as a meaningless ritual, with many countries dismissing its credibility. The US's reluctance to hold allies accountable while criticizing others has raised questions about its commitment to human rights and democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
