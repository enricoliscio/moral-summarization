SUMMARY:
The US has released its annual human rights report, inviting scorn and criticism for its hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has come under withering scrutiny, with many questioning the US's evenhanded approach. Critics argue that the US is berating countries it deems less important while glossing over the records of its allies. The report's treatment of Saudi Arabia, a country with a notoriously bad human rights record, has been particularly criticized. When questioned about US efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, Assistant Secretary Craner's responses were deemed glib and lacking in tangible advances. The report's credibility has been undermined by the US's duplicitous approach, leading many to view it as a meaningless ritual. END OF SUMMARY.
