SUMMARY: The US human rights report has been met with scepticism and scorn due to perceived hypocrisy and double standards in the war on terrorism. The report, which is meant to scrutinize human rights violations, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. While countries like India are subjected to a litany of violations, the report turns a blind eye to allies with poor human rights records. US officials struggled to defend their policy, facing sharp questioning about their duplicity and tangible actions in Saudi Arabia. Critics argue that the report is meaningless and evenhanded, with the US punishing some countries while ignoring allies it bankrolls. The report's credibility is further diminished by its failure to address human rights violations within the US itself. Critics also point out that previous administrations have had similar conversations with Saudi Arabia, with little to no tangible effect on human rights outcomes. The US is urged to demonstrate how it is addressing human rights differently and to provide indications of progress in these discussions. END OF SUMMARY.
