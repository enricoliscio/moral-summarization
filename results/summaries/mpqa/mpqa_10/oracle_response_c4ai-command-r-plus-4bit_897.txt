SUMMARY: The annual release of the US human rights report has been met with scepticism and charges of hypocrisy and double standards. The report, which does not include an assessment of human rights in the US itself, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while countries like India are scrutinized in detail. Amid domestic criticism over the curtailment of civil liberties, US officials struggled to defend American policy and convince the press that the report was evenhanded and fair. The report's release has become a ritual that many feel is meaningless, with Washington glossing over the human rights record of its allies while berating less relevant countries. Critics in the media sharply questioned the duplicity of US actions, particularly in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the worst human rights records in the world. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, Lorne Cramer, struggled to defend American policy and provide tangible examples of promoting democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out that previous administrations have also talked about these issues with the Saudis, with little effect. The US was unable to provide a satisfactory response, highlighting the perceived double standards and hypocrisy in its human rights policy. END OF SUMMARY.
