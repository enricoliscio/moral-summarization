SUMMARY:
The US annual human rights report has been met with scorn and scepticism due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, particularly in light of the US's own curtailment of civil liberties. Critics have pointed out the duplicity in the report, which berates countries like India while glossing over the records of its allies. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour struggled to defend the report, dodging questions on tangible actions being taken to promote democracy and human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia. The report's credibility has been questioned, with many seeing it as a meaningless ritual. END OF SUMMARY.
