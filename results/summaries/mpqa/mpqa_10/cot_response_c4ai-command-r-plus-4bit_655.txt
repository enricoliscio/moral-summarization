END OF SUMMARY.
The United States' annual human rights report was met with scepticism and scorn due to perceived hypocrisy and double standards in its treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report, which does not evaluate the human rights situation within the US, was criticized for its selective scrutiny of violations in certain countries while glossing over the records of US allies. While countries like India were subjected to a litany of criticisms, the report turned over in just 32 pages when discussing Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries globally. US officials struggled to defend their policies, facing sharp questions about their efforts to promote democracy and human rights in these allies. Critics highlighted the lack of tangible progress and visible actions, particularly in Saudi Arabia, despite years of discussions. The report's release amidst domestic criticism over civil liberties curtailment further undermined its credibility. Many view the exercise as an increasingly meaningless ritual, with Washington prioritizing geopolitical interests over human rights concerns when dealing with allies.
