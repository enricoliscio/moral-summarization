Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is getting a lot of criticism. People are calling it hypocritical because the US is treating its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan softly while criticizing others. The report doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair.

The article mentions that the report is detailed for countries like India but very short for Saudi Arabia, which is a big issue. Critics point out that the US doesn't punish its allies even when they have bad human rights records, which makes the report seem biased. 

At the briefing, the Assistant Secretary, Lorne Craner, is questioned about what the US is doing in Saudi Arabia. He dodges the questions and talks about other countries instead. The criticism is that the US is not doing enough to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, and the report is seen as a meaningless ritual because of this double standard.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: the release of the report, the criticism of hypocrisy, the lack of self-examination by the US, the detailed vs. short reports on different countries, the failure to address allies' issues, and the questioning at the briefing. Also, the moral framing is about the US's hypocrisy and the report's credibility.

I should keep it under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:", and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Let me try to put this together concisely.

SUMMARY: The U.S. released its annual human rights report, sparking criticism for perceived hypocrisy and double standards, especially amid the war on terrorism. The report, which details human rights violations in other countries but not the U.S., faced scrutiny for its lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Critics argue that the report has become a ritual, with the U.S. failing to hold its allies accountable while criticizing others. During a briefing, Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner struggled to address questions about U.S. efforts to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing vague commitments and avoiding concrete examples. The report's credibility is further eroded by its brevity on allies like Saudi Arabia, despite its extensive coverage of countries like India. The U.S. approach to human rights is seen as hypocritical, undermining its moral authority. END OF SUMMARY.
