SUMMARY: The release of the US's annual human rights report was met with skepticism and accusations of hypocrisy, particularly regarding the treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Critics questioned the double standards and the US's own record on civil liberties. The report, which does not include an assessment of human rights in the US, focuses on alleged violations in other countries, including India. The US was criticized for its inaction towards allies with poor human rights records while scrutinizing less relevant countries. At a briefing, officials struggled to defend their policies, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia. They cited ongoing discussions with the Saudi government and other Muslim-majority countries about promoting democracy and human rights, but critics demanded tangible actions and outcomes. The exchange highlighted the challenges faced by the US in balancing its strategic interests with its commitment to human rights and democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
