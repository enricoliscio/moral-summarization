SUMMARY: The annual release of the US human rights report has been met with scepticism and charges of hypocrisy and double standards. The report, which is mandated by Congress, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while countries like India are scrutinized in detail. Amid domestic criticism over the curtailment of civil liberties, US officials struggled to defend their evenhanded approach and their failure to include the state of human rights in the US itself. The report, which is a compendium of alleged human rights violations, has increasingly been seen as a meaningless ritual by many countries, especially in light of Washington's selective assistance and punishment of nations based on their relevance to US interests. Critics in the media sharply questioned the duplicity of US policy, specifically in regards to Saudi Arabia, and the lack of tangible actions to promote democracy and human rights in the country. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, Lorne Cramer, defended American policy but struggled to provide specific examples of their efforts in Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out that previous administrations had also spoken to the Saudis about human rights issues with little effect. The exchange highlights the perceived double standards and selective treatment in US foreign policy, with critics demanding more transparency and tangible actions to promote democracy and human rights.
