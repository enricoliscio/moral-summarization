Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is causing a lot of criticism. People are saying the US is hypocritical because they're not holding their allies, like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, to the same standards. The report itself doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which some officials say is fair because they don't want to be biased.

The article mentions that the report is detailed for countries like India but very short for Saudi Arabia, which is known for having a bad human rights record. Critics are pointing out that the US isn't doing much to push for democracy in Saudi Arabia, even though they talk about it. The US officials, like Assistant Secretary Craner, are trying to defend their policies but aren't providing clear examples of what they're doing in Saudi Arabia.

The moral framing here is that the US is being hypocritical by criticizing other countries while ignoring their allies' human rights issues. The author is highlighting the double standards and the lack of tangible actions from the US to improve human rights in their allied countries.

So, the summary needs to capture the criticism of the US's report, the hypocrisy charge, the focus on allies, and the lack of concrete actions. It should also mention that the report doesn't evaluate the US's own human rights situation.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the report and the criticism, then explain the hypocrisy, mention the treatment of allies versus others, and conclude with the lack of clear actions. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all these points.

SUMMARY: The US annual human rights report has faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, particularly amid the war on terrorism. Critics highlight Washington's lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while the report extensively documents human rights violations in countries like India. The report, which does not assess the US's own human rights record, is increasingly seen as a ritual lacking substance. Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner struggled to defend US policies, failing to provide concrete examples of efforts to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia. The report's credibility is undermined by the US's reluctance to hold allies accountable, despite criticizing other nations. The moral framing underscores the hypocrisy of criticizing others while overlooking allies' rights abuses, raising questions about the US's commitment to human rights promotion. END OF SUMMARY.
