SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with widespread criticism and scorn due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's "kid glove treatment" of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, while the US's own curtailment of civil liberties has been largely ignored. The report's methodology has been questioned, with some arguing that it is a meaningless ritual that fails to hold the US accountable for its own human rights violations. The US's lack of evenhandedness in its treatment of different countries has been particularly galling, with critics pointing out the duplicity of berating countries like India while turning a blind eye to the egregious human rights records of allies like Saudi Arabia. The report's defenders have struggled to justify the US's approach, with Assistant Secretary Craner's evasive answers at a press briefing only adding to the perception of hypocrisy. The US's failure to promote democracy and human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia has been particularly egregious, with critics arguing that the US is more interested in providing assistance to its allies than in promoting genuine democratic participation and respect for human rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
