SUMMARY: The release of the US's annual human rights report was met with skepticism and accusations of hypocrisy, with critics pointing to the country's lenient treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. While countries like India are scrutinized extensively, others with poor human rights records are given a pass due to their strategic importance. The report, which does not evaluate human rights within the US, has faced increasing criticism for its apparent double standards and lack of impact on US foreign policy. Officials struggled to defend their actions, citing vague discussions with Saudi Arabia about democratic reforms while failing to provide concrete examples of progress. Critics questioned the effectiveness of the report, arguing that it has become a meaningless ritual with little consequence for countries that commit human rights violations. The US's selective approach to human rights undermines its credibility and raises questions about its commitment to upholding universal values. END OF SUMMARY.
