SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with widespread skepticism and scorn due to charges of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid-glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, particularly in light of the ongoing war on terrorism. Critics argue that the US is guilty of duplicity, berating countries less relevant to it while turning a blind eye to the human rights violations of its allies.

The report itself is a compendium of alleged human rights violations, but its credibility is undermined by the US's lack of evenhandedness. The country's own human rights record is not subject to scrutiny, with officials claiming it wouldn't be "fair" to do so. The report's treatment of Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, is particularly egregious, with critics questioning the US's commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in the region.

The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour struggled to defend American policy, with critics accusing the administration of paying lip service to human rights issues in countries like Saudi Arabia. The report's lack of tangible advances in promoting democracy and human rights in these countries has only added to the skepticism surrounding the exercise.

END OF SUMMARY.
