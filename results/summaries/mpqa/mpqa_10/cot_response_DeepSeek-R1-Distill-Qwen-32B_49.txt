Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the steps.

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "scepticism," "scorn," "hypocrisy," "double standards," "kid glove treatment," "withering scrutiny," "unfair," "curtailment," "civil liberties," "unjust," "glossing over," "duplicity," "glib," "dismissive," "surprised," "lamented," "promote," "tangible," "transparency," "credibility," and "meaningless ritual." These words highlight the moral issues discussed in the article.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I'll make sure to include these moral terms to maintain the original framing. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the release of the US human rights report and the criticism it received. I'll note the hypocrisy accusations, the treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia, and the lack of action. I'll also touch on the questioning of the report's fairness and the administration's vague responses. Finally, I'll conclude by highlighting the growing skepticism about the report's effectiveness.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the original text. Keeping it clear and focused on the moral aspects is crucial.

**SUMMARY:**  
The release of the US annual human rights report drew widespread scepticism and scorn, with critics accusing the US of hypocrisy and double standards, particularly in its kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the war on terrorism. The report, which compiles alleged human rights violations from various sources, faced withering scrutiny for its perceived unfairness, especially as it does not examine human rights within the US itself. Domestic criticism over civil liberties curtailments further eroded the report's credibility. The report's treatment of countries like Saudi Arabia, with only 32 pages despite being one of the least free nations, contrasted sharply with the extensive coverage of democratic nations like India. US officials struggled to defend their policies, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner facing sharp questions about the lack of tangible actions to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia. Critics argued that the report had become a meaningless ritual, highlighting the growing distrust in Washington's commitment to human rights and its selective enforcement of standards. END OF SUMMARY.
