SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with skepticism and scorn due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report criticizes human rights violations in various countries, but glosses over the records of its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on India, a democratic country, is over 100 pages long, while Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries, is dealt with in just 32 pages. Critics have questioned the US's duplicity, pointing out that it has shown no inclination to punish its allies, while berating countries less relevant to it. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour struggled to defend American policy, but failed to provide tangible examples of efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. The report has been criticized for being a meaningless ritual, with many countries taking it less seriously due to the US's inconsistent approach.
