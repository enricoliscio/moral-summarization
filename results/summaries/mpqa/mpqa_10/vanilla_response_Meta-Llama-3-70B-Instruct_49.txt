SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with skepticism and criticism due to perceived hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but critics argue that the US is lenient towards its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on Saudi Arabia, for instance, is only 32 pages long, despite the country's poor human rights record. US officials struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner being questioned about the US's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Craner's responses were deemed evasive, and he failed to provide tangible examples of US efforts to improve human rights in the country. The report has been criticized for its lack of self-reflection, as it does not examine human rights violations within the US itself. The exercise has been seen as increasingly meaningless, with many countries taking it less seriously due to the US's inconsistent approach.
