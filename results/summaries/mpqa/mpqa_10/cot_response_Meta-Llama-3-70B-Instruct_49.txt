SUMMARY:
The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with scorn and hypocrisy accusations due to its kid-glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report has been criticized for its duplicity, with secular and democratic countries like India receiving a litany of criticism, while countries like Saudi Arabia, with one of the worst human rights records, getting a relatively gentle 32-page report. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour, Lorne Craner, struggled to defend American policy, with critics questioning the lack of tangible advances in promoting democracy and human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia. The report has been deemed a meaningless ritual, with many countries taking it less seriously due to Washington's hypocrisy. END OF SUMMARY.
