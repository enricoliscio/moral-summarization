Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the US human rights report and the criticism it received. 

First, I should identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Words like "hypocrisy," "double standards," "scepticism," "scorn," "withering scrutiny," "unfair," "curtailment," "criticism," "duplicity," "glossing over," "bankrolls," "democracy," "violations," "abuses," "oppressive," "injustices," "transparency," "fairness," "credibility," and "ritual" come to mind. These words carry strong moral connotations and are crucial for the summary.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should highlight the main points: the US report's release, the criticism of hypocrisy and double standards, the treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, domestic criticism over civil liberties, the report's focus on other countries, and the lack of tangible actions to improve human rights in Saudi Arabia. I should ensure the summary is under 200 words and captures the moral framing effectively.

I'll start by mentioning the release of the report and the ensuing criticism. Then, I'll discuss the treatment of allies and the domestic criticism. I'll include the report's focus on other countries and the lack of action on Saudi Arabia. Finally, I'll note the administration's claims of progress without evidence, tying it back to the moral issues raised.

I should make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the key moral terms identified. This way, the summary will reflect the author's original moral perspective accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  
The US annual human rights report released in 2001 faced widespread criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, particularly amid the war on terrorism. Critics accused the US of soft treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while harshly scrutinizing others. Domestic criticism over civil liberties curtailment added to the skepticism. The report, compiled from various sources, detailed human rights violations globally but notably excluded the US, deeming it "unfair." Countries like India received extensive scrutiny, while Saudi Arabia, one of the least free nations, was addressed in just 32 pages. The US claimed to promote democracy and human rights but struggled to provide tangible actions, especially in Saudi Arabia. Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner defended the administration's efforts, citing talks with Saudi authorities, but critics questioned the lack of visible progress. The report's credibility was further eroded by the perception of duplicity, with the US failing to hold allies accountable while criticizing less influential nations. The exercise, once linked to foreign assistance, increasingly appeared as a meaningless ritual, undermining its moral authority. END OF SUMMARY.
