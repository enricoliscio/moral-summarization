SUMMARY: The US has been accused of hypocrisy and double standards in its annual human rights report, with critics arguing that the report ignores the country's own shortcomings while scrutinizing other nations. The report, which is mandated by Congress, has been criticized for its selective focus and lenient treatment of US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. While countries like India are subjected to a detailed litany of human rights violations, other nations with questionable records are given a cursory mention. At a briefing, US officials struggled to defend their policy, facing sharp questions about their efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Lorne Cramer, faced intense scrutiny and was unable to provide specific examples of tangible actions taken by the US to address human rights issues in Saudi Arabia. Critics pointed out that previous administrations had also claimed to engage with the Saudis on these issues, with little apparent effect. The exchange highlights the skepticism and moral dilemmas surrounding the US human rights report, calling into question the country's commitment to even-handedness and its willingness to address its own shortcomings.
