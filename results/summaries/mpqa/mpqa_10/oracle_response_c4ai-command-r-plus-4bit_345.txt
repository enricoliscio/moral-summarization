SUMMARY: The annual release of the US human rights report has been met with scepticism and charges of hypocrisy and double standards. While the report scrutinizes countries like India in great detail, it glosses over the records of US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, leading to accusations of a ritualistic and meaningless exercise that ignores US complicity in human rights violations. Critics question the US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour about the apparent duplicity, particularly in the treatment of Saudi Arabia. The official struggles to defend American policy, citing ongoing conversations with the Saudi government and other Muslim-majority countries about improving their human rights records. However, critics remain unconvinced, pointing out the lack of tangible outcomes and the absence of any visible change in US policy towards Saudi Arabia. This exchange highlights the perceived inconsistency and selectivity in how the US addresses human rights issues, with critics arguing that the report's mandate of evenhandedness and fairness is not being met.
