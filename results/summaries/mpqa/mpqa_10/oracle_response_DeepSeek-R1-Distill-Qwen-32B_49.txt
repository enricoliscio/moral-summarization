Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which has faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report doesn't examine the US's own human rights situation, which some argue is unfair. The author uses several morally charged words that I need to include in the summary.

First, I'll identify the key points: the report's release amid skepticism, the criticism of hypocrisy and double standards, the focus on other countries while ignoring the US's own issues, the detailed reports on countries like India versus the brief mention of Saudi Arabia, and the US's reluctance to criticize its allies. The briefing with Lorne Craner highlights the lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia, which raises questions about the US's commitment to promoting democracy and human rights.

I need to make sure to include words like hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, treatment, mandated, ritual, curtailment, evenhanded, fair, violations, assistance, duplicity, help, fund, democracy, rights, voice, participation, and issues. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the report's release, the criticism, the content of the report, the briefing, and the underlying issues of hypocrisy and double standards.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral critique presented in the article. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the provided content while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The US annual human rights report, released amid widespread skepticism, faced criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, particularly regarding its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report, mandated by Congress, is increasingly seen as a meaningless ritual, with domestic criticism over civil liberties curtailment and accusations of uneven treatment of allies versus others. The US avoids examining its own human rights record, deeming it "unfair." While detailed reports on countries like India highlight violations, Saudi Arabia, a major human rights violator, receives minimal scrutiny. Critics question the US's duplicity, as it promotes democracy in some nations while overlooking allies. During a briefing, Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner struggled to justify US actions, emphasizing talks with Saudi Arabia but failing to provide tangible examples. The report's focus on assisting allies while criticizing less relevant nations raises concerns about the US's commitment to evenhandedness and fairness in promoting democracy and human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
