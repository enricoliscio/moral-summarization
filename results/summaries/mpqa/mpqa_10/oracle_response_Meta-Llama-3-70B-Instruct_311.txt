SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with widespread skepticism and scorn due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's "kid glove treatment" of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, particularly in light of the ongoing war on terrorism. Critics argue that the US is guilty of duplicity, berating countries less relevant to it while glossing over the records of its allies. The report's treatment of Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, has been particularly criticized, with many questioning the US's commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in the country. Assistant Secretary Craner struggled to defend American policy, citing vague examples of "talking to the Saudi government" and "encouraging others in the Muslim world" to promote democracy, but failing to provide tangible evidence of progress. The report's credibility has been further undermined by the US's refusal to examine its own human rights record, citing concerns that it "wouldn't be fair."
