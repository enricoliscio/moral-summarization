SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with skepticism and scorn due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report criticizes countries like India, but glosses over the human rights records of US allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The US Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour struggled to defend American policy, with critics pointing out the duplicity in the report. The US has shown no inclination to punish its allies, despite their poor human rights records. The report's credibility is further eroded by the fact that it does not examine the state of human rights in the US itself. The moral duplicity of the US is evident in its kid-glove treatment of its allies, while berating countries that are less relevant to its interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
