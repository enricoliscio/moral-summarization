Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, but it's getting a lot of criticism. People are saying the US is hypocritical because they're treating their allies, like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, with kid gloves while criticizing others. The report is supposed to be an annual administrative exercise mandated by Congress, but many think it's becoming meaningless.

The US is facing criticism both domestically and internationally. Domestically, because of the curtailment of civil liberties, and internationally because they're not holding their allies accountable. The report doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which one official says wouldn't be fair. 

Looking at specific examples, the report on India is over 100 pages, detailing various violations, while Saudi Arabia, which is one of the least free countries, only gets 32 pages. This shows a double standard. The US isn't punishing allies like Egypt and Turkey but is criticizing others less relevant to them.

At a press briefing, the US Assistant Secretary tried to defend the policy but struggled to provide concrete examples of what they're doing in Saudi Arabia to promote democracy and human rights. The questioning from the media was sharp, pointing out the hypocrisy and lack of tangible actions.

So, the moral framing here is about hypocrisy, double standards, and the US's failure to hold its allies accountable while criticizing others. The report is seen as a ritual without real impact. 

Now, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I should mention the criticism, the double standards, the lack of action in Saudi Arabia, and the perception of hypocrisy. Also, the fact that the report doesn't examine the US's own human rights situation adds to the criticism.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points clearly. Start with the release of the report and the criticism it received. Then mention the double standards with allies. Include the example of India vs. Saudi Arabia. Then talk about the press briefing and the lack of concrete actions. Conclude with the perception of the report as a meaningless ritual and the hypocrisy involved.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go. I'll aim for concise sentences to stay within 200 words.
