Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is causing a lot of criticism. The main points are the hypocrisy and double standards in the US's treatment of its allies versus others, especially in the context of the war on terrorism. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "hypocrisy," "double standards," "scepticism," "scorn," "unfair," "criticism," "curtailment," "meaningless," "glozing over," "duplicity," "critics," "glib," "promote," "tangible," "secret," "effect," "different," "judgment," "outcome." I'll list these as STEP 1.

Next, I need to write a summary that's no longer than 200 words. The summary should include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I should start by mentioning the release of the report and the criticism it received. Highlight the double standards, especially towards allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Mention the lack of action against these allies despite their poor human rights records. Also, include the officials' struggles to defend the report and the media's questioning of their policies. Finally, note the lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia and the criticism over the report's credibility.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures all the key points while maintaining the moral framing. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each paragraph addresses a main issue from the article. I'll keep sentences concise and focused on the moral aspects to stay within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The US annual human rights report released in 2001 faced intense criticism for its hypocrisy and double standards, particularly amid the war on terrorism. Critics accused the US of unfairly glossing over the human rights records of its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while scrutinizing others. The report, which does not examine the US's own human rights situation, was seen as a meaningless ritual by many. While countries like India received extensive criticism, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's least free nations, was barely addressed in just 32 pages. US officials struggled to defend their policies, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner failing to provide tangible examples of efforts to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia. Media criticism highlighted the lack of visible action and the administration's inability to distinguish its approach from previous ones. The report's credibility was further undermined by its selective focus and the perception of duplicity in US foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
