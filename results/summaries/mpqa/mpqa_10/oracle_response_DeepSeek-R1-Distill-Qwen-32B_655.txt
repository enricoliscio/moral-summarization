Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing of the original article. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about the US releasing their annual human rights report, which is getting criticized for hypocrisy and double standards, especially regarding their allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the war on terrorism.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the listed moral terms as possible. I should identify the key moral concepts in the article, like hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, human rights violations, and the US's treatment of allies versus others.

I'll start by summarizing the release of the report and the criticism it received. Then, mention the double standards, like how the US is lenient with allies but strict with others. I should include the part about the report not examining US human rights, which adds to the hypocrisy. Also, the questioning of the report's fairness and the lack of tangible actions in Saudi Arabia are important points.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and uses the moral terms effectively. I'll structure it to highlight the criticism, the double standards, the lack of action, and the overall perception of the report as a ritual without real impact. 

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include words like hypocrisy, double standards, terrorism, treatment, mandated, ritual, curtailment, evenhanded, fair, violations, assistance, duplicity, help, democracy, rights, participation, and so on. I'll make sure each point flows logically and covers the main criticisms without getting too detailed.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary, ensuring all key moral points are included. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the SUMMARY and END tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: The US annual human rights report, mandated by Congress, faced widespread criticism for hypocrisy and double standards, particularly amid the war on terrorism. Critics accused Washington of lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while scrutinizing others. The report, which does not examine US human rights practices, was seen as a meaningless ritual, with domestic criticism over civil liberties curtailment. The report compiles alleged violations from various sources, including local media, and highlights issues in countries like India, while sparing allies like Saudi Arabia from rigorous scrutiny. US officials struggled to defend the report's evenhandedness, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner facing sharp questioning about the lack of tangible actions to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Critics argued that the report's duplicity, such as glossing over allies' records while berating others, undermines its credibility. The report's original link to foreign assistance has eroded as many countries increasingly view it as a ritual without substance. END OF SUMMARY.
