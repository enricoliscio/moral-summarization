Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which has sparked criticism. People are accusing the US of hypocrisy because they're being lenient with allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, especially during the war on terrorism. The report doesn't examine the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. The report is detailed for countries like India but is much shorter for Saudi Arabia, which is seen as one of the least free countries. Critics point out that the US isn't punishing its allies but criticizing others. During a press briefing, officials tried to defend the policy, but the questioning was sharp, especially about Saudi Arabia. The Assistant Secretary mentioned efforts in other countries but couldn't provide specific examples for Saudi Arabia, leading to more criticism about the US's double standards.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I should highlight the main points: the release of the report, criticism of hypocrisy, the lack of scrutiny on the US itself, the focus on allies, the press briefing, and the inability to provide specific actions for Saudi Arabia. I should make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the release of the report and the criticism. Then mention the hypocrisy charge, the treatment of allies, and the lack of US self-examination. Then talk about the press briefing and the questions about Saudi Arabia. Finally, conclude with the criticism of double standards and the lack of concrete actions.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, make sure to mention the key countries involved and the main criticisms. I'll need to paraphrase some parts to keep it concise. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover the release, the criticism, the specifics about allies, the press questions, and the outcome of the briefing. I think that's the essence of the article. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: The US released its annual human rights report, sparking criticism for perceived hypocrisy and double standards, particularly amid the war on terrorism. The report, which does not examine the US's own human rights situation, has faced growing skepticism as a meaningless ritual. Critics highlight Washington's lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while harshly judging others. During a press briefing, US officials struggled to defend the policy, with sharp questioning about the lack of tangible actions to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. The report devotes minimal attention to Saudi Arabia, despite its poor human rights record, while countries like India receive extensive scrutiny. The US's failure to address its allies' rights issues contrasts with its criticism of less influential nations, drawing accusations of hypocrisy. END OF SUMMARY.
