SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with widespread criticism and scorn. The report has been accused of hypocrisy and double standards, as it glosses over the human rights records of its allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report does not examine the human rights situation in the US itself, citing that it "wouldn't be fair." Critics have pointed out that the report is heavily biased, with countries like India receiving a lengthy report while Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, gets a brief 32-page report. US officials have struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner being grilled by the press corps over the US's lack of action in promoting democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Craner's evasive answers have only added to the criticism, with many seeing the report as a meaningless exercise in hypocrisy.
