Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is causing a lot of criticism. People are calling it hypocritical because the US is being lenient with its allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, especially in the context of the war on terrorism.

The report itself doesn't look at the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. It's mostly based on media reports from other countries, and it's detailed for places like India but very brief for Saudi Arabia, which is a big point of contention.

The officials are trying to defend the report, saying it's evenhanded, but the media is skeptical. During the briefing, they were questioned about what the US is doing to promote human rights in Saudi Arabia, and the answers were vague. The officials mentioned talking to the Saudi government but didn't provide concrete examples, leading critics to question the US's commitment and the report's credibility.

I should make sure the summary captures the main points: the criticism of hypocrisy, the leniency towards allies, the lack of self-examination in the US report, the detailed vs. brief reports on different countries, and the officials' vague responses during the briefing. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.
