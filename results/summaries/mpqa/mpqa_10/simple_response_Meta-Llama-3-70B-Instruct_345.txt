SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with widespread skepticism and criticism. The report has been accused of hypocrisy and double standards, as it glosses over the human rights records of its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while being harsh on other countries. The report's treatment of Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, has been particularly criticized, with only 32 pages dedicated to its human rights record. US officials have struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner failing to provide concrete examples of US efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. The report has been seen as a meaningless ritual, with many countries taking it less seriously due to the US's inconsistent approach to human rights. The report's moral credibility has been questioned, with critics accusing the US of prioritizing its strategic interests over human rights concerns.
