SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with skepticism and scorn due to accusations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, while the US's own curtailment of civil liberties has been criticized. The report does not examine human rights violations within the US, with officials claiming it wouldn't be "fair." The report's credibility is further undermined by its uneven treatment of countries, with secular democracies like India receiving lengthy reports, while Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries, gets a mere 32 pages. Critics have questioned the US's duplicity in berating countries it deems less relevant, while turning a blind eye to the human rights records of its allies. Assistant Secretary Craner struggled to defend American policy, with his vague answers on Saudi Arabia's human rights record sparking further criticism.
