SUMMARY: 
The release of the annual US human rights report was met with unprecedented scepticism and scorn, with critics charging the US of hypocrisy and double standards in its war on terrorism. The report was criticized for its kid glove treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while secular and democratic countries like India were given a litany of human rights violations. The US was also accused of glossing over the human rights record of its allies and showing no inclination to punish them. At a briefing, US officials struggled to defend their policy, citing programmes in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan as examples of their commitment to human rights. Critics, however, sharply questioned the US's duplicity, especially in regards to Saudi Arabia, which has one of the worst human rights records in the world. The officials could not provide tangible examples of their efforts in Saudi Arabia and instead asked critics to judge by the outcome. The report's credibility was further undermined by its failure to address human rights issues within the US itself, with officials claiming that doing so "wouldn't be fair."
