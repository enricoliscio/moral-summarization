SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but the exercise has been met with widespread skepticism and scorn due to allegations of hypocrisy and double standards. The report's kid-glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has raised eyebrows, especially in light of the US's own curtailment of civil liberties in the war on terrorism. Critics argue that the report is a meaningless ritual, with the US showing no inclination to punish its bankrolled allies like Egypt and Turkey while berating less relevant countries. The report's evenhandedness has been questioned, with Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, receiving a relatively short 32-page report. US officials struggled to defend American policy, with Assistant Secretary Craner's responses on Saudi Arabia being deemed glib and evasive. The report's duplicity has been exposed, with the US's actions in Saudi Arabia being seen as mere lip service to democracy and human rights.
