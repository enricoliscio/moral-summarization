SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, but it has been met with widespread criticism and scorn due to its perceived hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but its treatment of US allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan has been criticized for being overly lenient. The report on Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, is only 32 pages long, whereas the report on India, a democratic country, is over 100 pages long. US officials have struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner being questioned about the US's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Craner's responses were evasive and failed to provide any tangible examples of US efforts to improve human rights in Saudi Arabia. The report has been criticized for being a meaningless ritual, with many countries taking it less seriously due to the US's inconsistent application of human rights standards.
