SUMMARY:

The US has released its annual human rights report, which has been met with skepticism and criticism due to its perceived hypocrisy and double standards. The report highlights human rights violations in various countries, but critics argue that the US is lenient towards its allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report on Saudi Arabia, for instance, is only 32 pages long, despite the country's poor human rights record. US officials struggled to defend the report, with Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner facing tough questions from the press corps. Craner was evasive about the US's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, citing ongoing talks with the government but failing to provide tangible examples. Critics argue that the US is not doing enough to pressure its allies to improve their human rights records, and that the report has become a meaningless ritual.
