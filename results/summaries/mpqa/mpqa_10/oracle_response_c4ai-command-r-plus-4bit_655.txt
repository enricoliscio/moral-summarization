SUMMARY: The United States' annual human rights report has been met with scepticism and charges of hypocrisy. The report, which does not include an assessment of human rights in the US itself, has been criticized for its kid-glove treatment of allies such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while focusing on violations in countries like India. Amid domestic criticism over the curtailment of civil liberties, US officials struggled to defend their evenhandedness and fairness in assessing human rights violations. Critics in the media sharply questioned the duplicity of US policy, asking what tangible steps the US was taking to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia. The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Lorne Craner, defended American policy but struggled to provide specific examples of US actions in Saudi Arabia. This exchange highlights the perceived double standards and secrecy surrounding US human rights policy, raising questions about the credibility and effectiveness of the annual report. END OF SUMMARY.
