Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is causing a lot of skepticism and scorn. People are accusing the US of hypocrisy because they're being lenient with their allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, especially in the context of the war on terrorism. The report is supposed to be an annual administrative exercise, but many think it's becoming meaningless.

The US is criticized for not looking at their own human rights situation, which an official called "unfair." The report compiles violations from various sources, including the media. For example, India's report is over 100 pages, listing violations by the government and groups like terrorists. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, one of the least free countries, only gets 32 pages. The US isn't punishing its allies but is criticizing others, which is seen as hypocritical.

At a press briefing, Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner tried to defend the US policy. Journalists questioned why the US wasn't doing more in countries like Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Egypt. Craner mentioned programs in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan but struggled to provide concrete examples for Saudi Arabia, leading to accusations of duplicity and hypocrisy.

The article highlights the double standards in US foreign policy, where they promote human rights in some countries but not in their allies, despite their poor records. The report's credibility is questioned because of this inconsistency.

Now, for the summary, I need to include the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words. I'll focus on the hypocrisy, double standards, scrutiny, and the lack of action in certain countries. I'll make sure to mention the US's leniency towards allies and the criticism they're facing for not holding themselves to the same standards.

I think I've got the main points. Time to put it all together concisely, making sure to preserve the moral framing as the article presented it.

**SUMMARY:**  
The US annual human rights report, released amid widespread skepticism, has been criticized for hypocrisy and double standards, particularly in the context of the war on terrorism. The report, which focuses on other countries' human rights violations while exempting the US, has faced scrutiny for its kid glove treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Critics argue that the report has become a meaningless ritual, with countries like India receiving extensive scrutiny, while Saudi Arabia, one of the least free nations, is barely addressed in 32 pages. US officials, including Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner, struggled to defend the administration's policies, with journalists questioning the lack of tangible actions to promote democracy and human rights in countries like Saudi Arabia. Craner's vague responses, such as mentioning discussions at "many levels," failed to address the criticism of hypocrisy and duplicity. The report's credibility is further undermined by the US's reluctance to hold its allies accountable while criticizing others, highlighting a glaring inconsistency in its approach to human rights.
