Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the US human rights report. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the release of the annual report and the criticism it's receiving. The main points are that the US is being accused of hypocrisy because they're not holding their allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to the same standards. The report doesn't include the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. Also, the report is getting less serious because countries don't take it as seriously anymore. The article mentions that the report is detailed for countries like India but very short for Saudi Arabia. There's a part where the US official, Lorne Craner, is questioned about what they're doing in Saudi Arabia, and he doesn't provide concrete examples. The summary should highlight the criticism, the hypocrisy charges, the lack of self-examination by the US, and the example of Saudi Arabia. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it: start with the release of the report, mention the criticism, explain the hypocrisy, note that the US doesn't include itself, mention the detailed reports on some countries vs. short ones on allies, and include the example with Craner's answers. That should cover the main points without going into too much detail. I'll make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The US released its annual human rights report, sparking criticism for perceived hypocrisy and double standards, especially amid the war on terrorism. Critics pointed out the lenient treatment of allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, while the report extensively detailed rights violations in countries like India. The report, mandated by Congress, has increasingly faced skepticism as many view it as a meaningless ritual. US officials struggled to defend the report's impartiality, particularly as it does not examine human rights within the US. The report on Saudi Arabia, one of the world's least free countries, was only 32 pages long, while India's report exceeded 100 pages. During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary Lorne Craner faced sharp questioning about the US's efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, with critics highlighting the lack of tangible actions. Craner emphasized discussions with Saudi authorities but provided few concrete examples, leading to accusations of duplicity and inaction. The report's credibility is further undermined as many countries increasingly dismiss it due to Washington's selective approach. END OF SUMMARY.
