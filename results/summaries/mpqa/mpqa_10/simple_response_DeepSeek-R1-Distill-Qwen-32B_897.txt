Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the US releasing its annual human rights report, which is usually met with criticism. This time, it's even more so because of the war on terrorism. The US is being accused of hypocrisy because they're treating their allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan leniently. The report itself doesn't include the US's own human rights situation, which some find unfair. The report is detailed for countries like India but very short for Saudi Arabia, which is a major concern. Critics point out that the US doesn't hold its allies accountable, even when they have bad human rights records. During a press briefing, officials tried to defend the policy, but their answers were vague, especially about Saudi Arabia. They mentioned efforts in other countries but couldn't provide concrete actions for Saudi Arabia, leading to more criticism about the US's double standards and lack of transparency.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral issues highlighted, like hypocrisy, double standards, and the US not holding allies accountable. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

The US annual human rights report, released amid criticism, has faced intense scrutiny for its perceived hypocrisy and double standards, particularly during the war on terrorism. The report, which details human rights violations in other countries but excludes the US, has been accused of being a ritual without real impact. Critics highlight the lenient treatment of US allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, despite their poor human rights records, while countries like India receive extensive scrutiny. During a press briefing, US officials struggled to defend their policy, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia, where they could not provide concrete examples of efforts to promote democracy and human rights. The report's credibility is further undermined by its brevity on Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the worst human rights records, compared to the detailed reports on others. The lack of tangible actions and the vague responses from officials have deepened accusations of hypocrisy and double standards, raising questions about the US's commitment to promoting human rights globally.  

END OF SUMMARY.
