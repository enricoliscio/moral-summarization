SUMMARY: The release of the US annual human rights report was met with skepticism and criticism, with many accusing the US of double standards and hypocrisy in its war on terrorism. The report, which does not include an assessment of human rights in the US itself, was seen as lenient towards allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan while being more critical of countries like India. At a briefing, US officials struggled to defend their policy and were questioned sharply by critics in the media. The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Lorne Cramer, was unable to provide specific examples of US efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, despite it being one of the least free countries in the world. Critics pointed out the discrepancy between the US's treatment of its allies and its criticism of other countries, with some arguing that the report has become a meaningless ritual. The report, however, does provide a comprehensive list of alleged human rights violations in various countries, including India, based on information from local media and other sources.
