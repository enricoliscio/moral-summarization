SUMMARY:
Local authorities in Lebanon have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's record. The report highlights the weakening of the central government's prerogatives and accuses Lebanon of being undemocratic and uncivilized, abusing human rights. The authorities take issue with the report's portrayal of the judiciary as being subjected to political pressure, and its claim that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control. The authorities' dissatisfaction with the report has been conveyed to the US Ambassador.
