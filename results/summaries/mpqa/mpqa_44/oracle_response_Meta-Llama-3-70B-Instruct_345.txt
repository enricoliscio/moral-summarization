SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country for weakening its central government's prerogatives. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic and uncivilized, and abusing human rights. The authorities take issue with the observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle." The report also highlights the serious matter of intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping the phones of certain government leaders, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. On a positive note, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The Foreign Ministry will deliver copies of the report to concerned ministries and relay its observations to the State Department in Washington. Lebanon will also send an explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control, a annual exercise.
