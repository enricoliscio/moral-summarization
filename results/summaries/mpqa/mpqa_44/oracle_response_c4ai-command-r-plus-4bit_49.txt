SUMMARY: Lebanese authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticized the country for the weakening of the central government's prerogatives, portraying Lebanon as undemocratic, uncivilized, and abusing human rights. The report also noted that the judiciary was subjected to political pressure and that intelligence agents monitored the opposition and tapped the phones of government leaders, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. While the Lebanese press is praised for its critical role, the authorities see the report as discrediting, and plan to send their observations to the State Department. The annual criticism is seen as unfair, given factors outside the government's control.
