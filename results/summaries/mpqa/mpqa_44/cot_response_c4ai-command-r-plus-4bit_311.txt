SUMMARY: Lebanese officials expressed their dissatisfaction and moral outrage at the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticized Lebanon's human rights record and portrayed the country in an undemocratic and uncivilized light. The report highlighted concerns about the weakening of the central government and political pressure on an "independent in principle" judiciary. The monitoring of opposition politicians and phone tapping of government leaders was also deemed a serious breach of democratic values and a harm to Lebanon's international image. However, the report praised the Lebanese press for its critical stance toward the government and its practices. 

The Lebanese authorities viewed the report as discrediting, arguing that it overlooked factors beyond the government's control and that similar criticisms were directed at multiple countries. They plan to send their observations to the State Department, emphasizing the external factors influencing Lebanon's human rights situation, an annual response to such reports.
