SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's record on various issues. The report highlights the "weakening" of the central government's prerogatives and portrays Lebanon as "undemocratic" and "uncivilized", accusing it of "abusing" human rights. The authorities are particularly concerned about the report's observation that the judiciary is "subjected" to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle". The report also notes that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians' activities and "tap" the phones of certain government leaders, which is seen as a serious matter that "harms" Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The authorities plan to respond to the report, citing factors outside of their control, and will convey their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador.
