SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's democratic and human rights record. The report, handed over to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, highlights concerns about the weakening of the central government and political pressure on the judiciary, with a particular reference to the monitoring of opposition politicians and the tapping of government leaders' phones. The authorities view the report as discrediting, portraying Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized. They emphasize that the issues raised are beyond their control and that the annual criticism is not exclusive to Lebanon but extends to several other countries. The Lebanese press, however, is praised in the report for its role in providing daily criticism of the government and its practices, a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing assessment of the country's human rights situation. End of summary. END OF SUMMARY.
