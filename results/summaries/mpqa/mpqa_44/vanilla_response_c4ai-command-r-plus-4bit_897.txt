SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the weakening of the central government and judicial independence in Lebanon. The report also mentions intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones, harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, it praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Lebanese authorities plan to send their observations to the State Department, emphasizing factors beyond the government's control, and will distribute the report to relevant ministries. They conveyed their dissatisfaction to US Ambassador Vincent Battle, who had just returned from Washington. The annual report covers several countries and is seen as discrediting Lebanon's democratic and civilized image.
