SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country for weakening its central government's prerogatives. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic and uncivilized, and abusing human rights. The authorities take issue with the observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle." The report also notes that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap the phones of certain government leaders, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. On a positive note, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control, but the report's criticism is still seen as a serious matter.
