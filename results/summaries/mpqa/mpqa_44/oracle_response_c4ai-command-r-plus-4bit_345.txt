SUMMARY: Lebanese authorities express frustration but not surprise at the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's record. The report, delivered to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, is seen as an attempt to discredit Lebanon by portraying it as undemocratic, uncivilized, and abusive of human rights. The most serious concern is the observation of political pressure on an "independent in principle" judiciary, along with intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones. This serious matter harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. The report also criticizes the weakening of the central government's prerogatives. Lebanese officials plan to send their observations to the State Department, explaining factors beyond their control, as they do annually. Meanwhile, the Lebanese press is praised for its critical role in daily government scrutiny.
