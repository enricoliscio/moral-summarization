SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record. The report, delivered to the Foreign Ministry, highlights the weakening of the central government's authority and alleges that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure. It also claims that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones, harming Lebanon's democratic image. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Officials have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador and will soon respond to the State Department with explanations for the issues raised. Lebanon sends an annual explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control. While officials are not surprised by the criticism, they believe the report discredits Lebanon and portrays it as undemocratic or uncivilized.
