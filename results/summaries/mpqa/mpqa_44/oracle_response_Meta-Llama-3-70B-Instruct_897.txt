SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country for weakening its central government's prerogatives and abusing human rights. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic and uncivilized. The authorities are particularly concerned about the report's observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle." The report also highlights the serious matter of intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping the phones of certain government leaders, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. On a positive note, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The authorities plan to respond to the report, citing factors outside of the government's control, and will soon deliver copies of the report to the relevant ministries. The US Ambassador has been informed of the authorities' dissatisfaction with the report's contents.
