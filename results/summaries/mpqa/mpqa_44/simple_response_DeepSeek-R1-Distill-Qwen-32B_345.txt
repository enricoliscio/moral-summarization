Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Lebanese officials reacting to the US human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's central government and judiciary, and mentions intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians. But it also praises the Lebanese press. 

I should start by identifying the main points: Lebanese officials are upset with the US report, which they find biased. The report criticizes Lebanon's government and judiciary, and the officials feel it's an annual criticism affecting Lebanon's image. They mention that they send explanations to the US each year about factors beyond their control. The report's key criticisms are about political pressure on the judiciary and intelligence activities, which harm Lebanon's democratic image. However, the press is praised for its critical role.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include the dissatisfaction, the specific criticisms, the annual nature of the report, the explanation Lebanon provides, and the positive note about the press. Also, I need to keep the moral framing, so highlighting the Lebanese perspective on the report's bias and impact on their image is important.

I'll structure it by first stating the officials' reaction, then the criticisms, the annual nature, the explanation process, the specific issues mentioned, and end with the positive aspect about the press. I'll make sure it's concise and flows well.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to be precise and avoid unnecessary details. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear, showing that Lebanon feels the report is unfair and affects their international image.

SUMMARY: Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which they view as biased and harmful to Lebanon's image. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority, the judiciary's independence under political pressure, and intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians, all of which officials argue tarnish Lebanon's democratic credentials. However, the report also praises the Lebanese press for its critical role in scrutinizing the government. The officials note that such criticism is an annual occurrence and not specific to Lebanon, emphasizing that they will respond by explaining factors beyond their control. They have conveyed their concerns to US Ambassador Vincent Battle and plan to distribute the report to relevant ministries before responding to the State Department. END OF SUMMARY.
