SUMMARY:
Local authorities in Lebanon have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, criticizing what it describes as the weakening of the central government's prerogatives. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon, portraying the country as undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human rights. The authorities take issue with the observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, which is considered a serious matter that harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. On the other hand, the report praises the role played by the Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about the factors outside of the government's control. The authorities will soon deliver their observations to the State Department in Washington.
