Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Lebanese officials reacting to a US human rights report. They're not happy but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's government and judiciary, saying they're under political pressure. It also mentions intelligence agents spying on opposition politicians and government leaders, which the officials think harms Lebanon's image as a democracy. 

On the positive side, the report praises the Lebanese press for criticizing the government. The Foreign Ministry received the report and will share it with other ministries before responding to the US. They mention that each year they explain factors beyond their control.

I should condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll include the main points: Lebanese officials' reaction, the criticisms in the report, the mention of intelligence activities, the praise for the press, and the Ministry's plan to respond.
