SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record. The report, delivered to the Foreign Ministry, highlights the weakening of the central government's authority and accuses Lebanon of abusing human rights. Authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador, citing that the report portrays Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report's most serious points include the judiciary being subjected to political pressure and intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Lebanon will send an explanation to the State Department, as it does annually, citing factors outside of the government's control. The report is seen as an annual event, covering several countries, and not specifically targeting Lebanon.
