SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked dissatisfaction among Lebanese officials, who feel it unfairly portrays the country as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority and alleges that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure. It also claims that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap the phones of certain government leaders. While the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government, officials argue that the criticism is not unique to Lebanon and is part of a broader report covering several countries. The authorities plan to respond to the report, citing factors outside of their control. The report's negative portrayal of Lebanon's human rights record is seen as harmful to the country's image as a democratic nation. Overall, the report is viewed as an annual event that unfairly targets Lebanon.
