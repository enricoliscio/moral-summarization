SUMMARY:
Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which they believe discredits Lebanon by portraying it as undemocratic, uncivilized, and abusive of human rights. The report, handed over to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, criticizes the weakening of the central government's prerogatives and notes that the judiciary is subject to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle". The serious matter of intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones is also addressed, as it harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praised the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of government practices, showcasing a vibrant and free press in the country. Each year, Lebanon defends itself by explaining the factors outside of the government's control that influence the situation. The authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador, Vincent Battle, who recently returned from Washington. The Lebanese government plans to deliver copies of the report to the relevant ministries and provide its observations to the State Department.
