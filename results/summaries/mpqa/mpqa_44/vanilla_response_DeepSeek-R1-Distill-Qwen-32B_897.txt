Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how Lebanese officials are reacting to a US human rights report. They're not happy with the report's content, but they're not surprised either. The report was delivered to the Foreign Ministry, and an official source mentioned that this criticism is an annual event. They point out that the criticism isn't just about Lebanon but several other countries too.

The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's powers. The US Embassy's deputy chief handed over the report to the Foreign Ministry. The ministry plans to share it with other relevant ministries and then respond to the US State Department. The officials are upset because the report portrays Lebanon negatively, suggesting it's undemocratic and uncivilized, which they see as discrediting the country.

The main points the officials are upset about include the judiciary being under political pressure, even though it's described as "independent in principle." They also mention that the report talks about intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping phones, which they feel harms Lebanon's democratic image. On a positive note, the report does praise the Lebanese press for criticizing the government daily.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the officials' dissatisfaction, the annual nature of the criticism, the specific criticisms in the report, and the positive note about the press. I should make sure to mention that the report was handed over and that the ministry will respond after distributing it internally. Also, the officials conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador.

Let me structure this: start with the officials' reaction, mention the annual nature, describe the report's criticism points, note the negative impact on Lebanon's image, and include the positive aspect about the press. Keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without going over the word limit.
