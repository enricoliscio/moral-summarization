SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record. The report, delivered to the Foreign Ministry, highlights the weakening of the central government's authority and political pressure on the judiciary. It also notes that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones. While the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government, officials see it as discrediting Lebanon and portraying it as undemocratic. The government plans to respond to the report, citing factors outside its control. This is an annual criticism, and officials have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador. The report's observations are seen as harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country.
