SUMMARY:
Lebanese officials expressed their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticized Lebanon's human rights record. The report portrayed Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized, accusing the country of abusing human rights. Authorities took issue with the report's observation that the judiciary was subjected to political pressure and that intelligence agents monitored opposition politicians and government leaders. They saw this as a serious matter that harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praised the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The Lebanese government plans to send its explanations to the State Department, addressing factors beyond their control that influence human rights in the country. The annual report, delivered by the US Embassy, has sparked a response from Lebanon, aiming to defend its democratic values and refute the allegations of human rights abuses.
