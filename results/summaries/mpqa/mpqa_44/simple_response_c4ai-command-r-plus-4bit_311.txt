SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express frustration but not surprise at the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's political and judicial situation. The report, handed over to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, highlights concerns about the weakening of the central government and political pressure on the judiciary, with intelligence agents monitoring opposition figures and tapping government leaders' phones. While the Lebanese authorities acknowledge the report's criticism, they view it as an unfair portrayal of the country as undemocratic and uncivilized, harming Lebanon's image as a democratic nation. They also emphasize that the issues raised are beyond their control and that the Lebanese press freely criticizes the government daily. The Lebanese government will provide its observations to the State Department, reiterating that the report's portrayal of the country is misleading and detrimental to its international reputation.
