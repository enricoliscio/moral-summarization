Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant is both a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the ethical implications in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Lebanese officials reacting to a US human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's weakening central government, calling it undemocratic and uncivilized, and accuses them of human rights abuses. The officials mention that this is an annual criticism affecting several countries. The report also points out political pressure on the judiciary and intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians, which harms Lebanon's democratic image. However, it does praise the press for criticizing the government.

The user highlighted specific morally charged words: weakening, undemocratic, uncivilized, abusing, subjected, tapping. I need to include these as much as possible in the summary. I'll make sure each of these words is present to maintain the moral tone.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the officials' reaction, the contents of the report, the specific criticisms, and the praise for the press. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

I'll start by stating the officials' dissatisfaction, mention the annual nature of the criticism, and then list the main points from the report using the specified words. I'll conclude with the officials' plan to respond and the positive note about the press. This should cover all necessary elements while keeping the moral perspective intact.

SUMMARY: Lebanese officials expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticized Lebanon for weakening its central government's authority, portraying the country as undemocratic, uncivilized, and abusing human rights. The report also accused the judiciary of being subjected to political pressure and intelligence agents of tapping opposition politicians' phones, which officials said harms Lebanon's democratic image. While the report praised the Lebanese press for its critical role in scrutinizing the government, officials conveyed their frustration to US Ambassador Vincent Battle. They plan to distribute the report to relevant ministries and respond to the State Department, emphasizing that some issues fall outside their control. The officials noted the annual nature of such criticism, which targets multiple countries, but stressed their commitment to addressing concerns while defending Lebanon's democratic credentials. END OF SUMMARY.
