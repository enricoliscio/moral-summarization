SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the weakening of the central government and judicial independence in Lebanon. The report also mentions monitoring of opposition politicians and phone tapping by intelligence agents, which officials say harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. The Lebanese authorities plan to send their observations to the State Department, emphasizing factors beyond the government's control. The report, however, praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. The Lebanese government views the report as discrediting, portraying the country as undemocratic and abusive of human rights.
