SUMMARY:
Local authorities in Lebanon have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's weakening central government and alleges undemocratic and uncivilized practices. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon and harming its image as a democratic country. Specifically, it notes that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure and that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones, which is a serious matter. On the other hand, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control. The authorities' dissatisfaction with the report has been conveyed to the US Ambassador.
