SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express displeasure but not surprise at the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record and governance. The report, delivered to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, suggests that the central government's power has weakened and that the judiciary is subject to political pressure, while also noting the positive role of a critical Lebanese press. Authorities plan to share the report with relevant ministries and provide feedback to the State Department, emphasizing that the issues raised are often beyond government control. They also take issue with the portrayal of Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized, arguing that it discredits the country. The annual report covers multiple countries and is seen as an expected occurrence, with Lebanon routinely providing explanations for the issues raised.
