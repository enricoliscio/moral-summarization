Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary needs to capture the essence of the article, including the moral or ethical implications as presented by the author.

First, I'll read through the provided news article to understand the main points. The article talks about how Lebanese officials are reacting to the US State Department's annual human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised, noting that the criticism is annual and not just directed at Lebanon. The report criticizes Lebanon's central government and judiciary, mentions intelligence monitoring, but also praises the press. The officials plan to respond, emphasizing factors beyond their control.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the dissatisfaction, the annual nature of the criticism, the specific points the report makes (weakened government, judiciary issues, intelligence monitoring), the positive note about the press, and the officials' response. I also need to maintain the moral framing, which seems to be about Lebanon's image and the fairness of the report.

I'll structure the summary to start with the officials' reaction, mention the annual nature, then outline the criticisms and the positive aspect. Finally, I'll note the planned response and the emphasis on uncontrollable factors. Keeping it concise while covering all key points is essential.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll make sure to include the moral elements, like the impact on Lebanon's image and the fairness of the report's portrayal.

SUMMARY: Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country for weakening central government authority, judicial independence, and intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians. They dismissed the report as an annual ritual, noting it targets multiple countries, including Lebanon. The report was handed to the Foreign Ministry by the US Embassy, and officials plan to distribute it to relevant ministries before responding to the US. The officials argue the report discredits Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic and uncivilized, while emphasizing factors beyond their control. They highlighted the judiciary's "independence in principle" as a serious issue and criticized the mention of intelligence surveillance as harmful to Lebanon's democratic image. However, the report praised Lebanon's press for its critical role in scrutinizing the government. END OF SUMMARY.
