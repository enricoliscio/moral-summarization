SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's weakening central government and portrays it as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report accuses Lebanon of abusing human rights, particularly with regards to the judiciary, which is seen as being subjected to political pressure. Additionally, the report highlights the monitoring of opposition politicians' activities and tapping of government leaders' phones, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. The authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador, emphasizing that the report discredits Lebanon. However, the report does praise the Lebanese press, which is described as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about the factors outside of the government's control. The report's criticism is seen as an annual event, covering several other countries as well.
