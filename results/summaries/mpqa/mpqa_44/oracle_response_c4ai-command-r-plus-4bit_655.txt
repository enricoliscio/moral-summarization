SUMMARY: Lebanese authorities express frustration but not surprise at the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the weakening of the central government's prerogatives and portrays Lebanon in an undemocratic, uncivilized light. The report also highlights concerns about political pressure on the judiciary and intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and government leaders, tarnishing Lebanon's image as a democratic country. While the Lebanese press is praised for its critical role, the authorities defend their actions, citing factors beyond their control and emphasizing that such criticism is an annual occurrence not unique to Lebanon. This year, the report's implications are seen as particularly harmful to Lebanon's international reputation and democratic credentials.

END OF SUMMARY.
