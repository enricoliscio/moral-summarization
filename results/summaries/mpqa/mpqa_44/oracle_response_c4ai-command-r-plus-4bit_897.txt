SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's record. The report, delivered to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, highlights concerns about the weakening of the central government's power and the abuse of human rights in Lebanon. It also mentions the judiciary's susceptibility to political pressure and intelligence agents' monitoring of opposition figures, painting Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized. The Lebanese authorities view the report as discrediting, harming the country's image as a democratic nation. They plan to provide explanations and context to the State Department, emphasizing factors beyond the government's control. The Lebanese press, however, is praised in the report for its critical role in daily government scrutiny. The Lebanese officials' reaction to the report showcases their sensitivity towards preserving the country's democratic image and their commitment to addressing external perceptions of human rights abuses.
