Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Lebanese officials reacting to a US human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's central government, judiciary, and intelligence activities. The officials argue that these criticisms are annual and not just about Lebanon. They also mention that the report discredits Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report was handed over by a US official, and Lebanon plans to send their response, explaining factors beyond their control. They found the judiciary issue the most serious and criticized the mention of intelligence monitoring. However, the report did praise the Lebanese press for criticizing the government.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The moral framing here is the Lebanese officials' perspective on the US report as biased and unfair, affecting Lebanon's image. I should highlight their dissatisfaction, the specific criticisms, and their counterpoints. Also, note the positive mention of the press.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with SUMMARY: and ends with END OF SUMMARY. I'll structure it by first stating the officials' reaction, then the report's criticisms, their counterarguments, and the positive aspect about the press. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Let me draft the summary: Start with the officials' dissatisfaction, mention the annual nature of the criticism, the specific points in the report, their arguments against the report's portrayal, and the positive note on the press. Keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which they view as an annual criticism not unique to Lebanon. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority, the judiciary's independence under political pressure, and intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians, which officials argue harms Lebanon's democratic image. However, the report also praises Lebanon's press for its critical coverage of the government. The Foreign Ministry has received the report and plans to share it with relevant ministries before responding to the US. Officials emphasized that the report's portrayal of Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized is discrediting, and they have conveyed their concerns to US Ambassador Vincent Battle. Lebanon intends to explain factors beyond its control in its response. END OF SUMMARY.
