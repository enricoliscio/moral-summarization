SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's political and judicial situation. While the report paints a negative picture of Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic and abusive of human rights, officials defend their country, arguing that the report discredits Lebanon's image as a democratic nation. They emphasize that the report's criticism is not unique to Lebanon and that it overlooks factors beyond the government's control. The most serious concern raised by the officials is the allegation of political pressure on the judiciary, which they assert is independent in principle. They also take issue with the report's claim that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones, seeing it as harmful to Lebanon's democratic reputation. Nonetheless, the Lebanese press is praised in the report for its critical role in daily government scrutiny.
