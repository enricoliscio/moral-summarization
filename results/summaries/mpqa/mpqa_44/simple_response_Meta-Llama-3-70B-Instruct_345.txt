SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked dissatisfaction among Lebanese officials, who feel it discredits the country by portraying it as undemocratic and abusive of human rights. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority and alleges that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure. It also claims that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones, harming Lebanon's democratic image. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Authorities have expressed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador and will soon respond to the State Department. This is not a surprise, as Lebanon faces similar criticism every year and attributes it to factors outside of its control. The report's moral framing suggests that Lebanon's democratic credentials are questionable and that its human rights record is flawed.
