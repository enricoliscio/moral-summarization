SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record. The report, delivered to the Foreign Ministry, highlights the weakening of the central government's authority and accuses Lebanon of abusing human rights. The authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador, citing that the report discredits Lebanon and portrays it as undemocratic. The report's most serious points include the judiciary being subjected to political pressure and intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Lebanon will respond to the report, as it does annually, explaining factors outside of the government's control. The report's findings are seen as harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country.
