SUMMARY:
Local authorities in Lebanon have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country for weakening its central government's prerogatives. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon, portraying it as undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human rights. The authorities take issue with the report's claim that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, which harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the role of the Lebanese press, which contains daily criticism of the government and its practices. Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department about factors outside of the government's control. The authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction with the report to the US Ambassador, who has recently returned from a conference in Washington. END OF SUMMARY.
