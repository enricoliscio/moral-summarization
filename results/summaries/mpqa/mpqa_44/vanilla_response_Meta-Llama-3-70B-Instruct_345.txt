SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's human rights record. The report, delivered to the Foreign Ministry, highlights the weakening of the central government's authority and alleges political pressure on the judiciary. It also accuses intelligence agents of monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones. While the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government, officials see the report as discrediting Lebanon and portraying it as undemocratic. The authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador and will soon respond to the State Department with explanations for the issues raised. This is an annual ritual, with Lebanon sending a response to the State Department each year. The report's criticism is not unique to Lebanon, as it covers several other countries as well.
