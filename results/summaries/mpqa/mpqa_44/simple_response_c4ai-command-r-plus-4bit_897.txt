SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express frustration but not surprise at the US State Department's critical annual report on human rights in Lebanon, seeing it as an attempt to discredit the country. While the report highlights concerns about the weakening of central government power and political pressure on an "independent in principle" judiciary, it also makes serious allegations of government surveillance of opposition politicians and human rights abuses, which the Lebanese authorities believe tarnishes the country's image as a democratic nation. The Lebanese press, however, is commended in the report for its daily criticism of government practices, a bright spot acknowledged by local authorities. Lebanon plans to provide explanations to the State Department, citing factors beyond government control, as it does annually. This exchange underscores the sensitive nature of international assessments of a country's human rights record and the potential for such reports to be perceived as challenges to a nation's sovereignty and democratic credentials.
