SUMMARY: Lebanese officials have expressed their dissatisfaction and criticism regarding the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which portrays Lebanon in a negative light. The report suggests a weakening of the central government and political pressure on the judiciary, which is described as "independent in principle." The authorities view the report as discrediting, depicting Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized, with abuses of human rights. The most serious concerns involve the judiciary's independence and the monitoring of politicians' activities and government leaders' phone tapping by intelligence agents. However, the Lebanese press is praised for its critical role in daily government scrutiny. Lebanon annually provides explanations to the State Department regarding factors beyond the government's control, and this year, the authorities have conveyed their dissatisfaction directly to the US Ambassador.
