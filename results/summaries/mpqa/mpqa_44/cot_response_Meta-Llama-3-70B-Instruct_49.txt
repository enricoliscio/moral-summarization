SUMMARY:
Local authorities in Lebanon have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's weakening central government and portrays it as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report, which was delivered to the Foreign Ministry, also accuses Lebanon of abusing human rights. Officials have taken issue with the report's observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, which they see as a serious matter that harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices. The authorities plan to respond to the report, citing factors outside of their control. This is an annual event, and officials emphasize that the criticism is not directed at Lebanon alone, but covers several other countries as well. END OF SUMMARY.
