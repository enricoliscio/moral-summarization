SUMMARY:
Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which they believe unfairly criticizes Lebanon's human rights record. The report is seen as discrediting, portraying Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized, with allegations of human rights abuses. Authorities take issue with the report's observation of political pressure on the judiciary and the monitoring of opposition politicians and government leaders, which they believe harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of government practices, highlighting the freedom of expression in the country. The Lebanese government plans to send its response to the State Department, explaining factors beyond their control, as they do annually. The officials also conveyed their dissatisfaction directly to the US Ambassador, Vincent Battle.
