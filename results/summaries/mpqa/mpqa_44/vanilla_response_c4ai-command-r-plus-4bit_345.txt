SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express displeasure but little surprise at the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the weakening of the central government and suggests political interference in the judiciary. The report also mentions intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones, which officials say harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country. The Lebanese authorities plan to send their observations to the State Department, emphasizing factors beyond the government's control, as they do every year. The report, delivered by a US Embassy official to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, covers multiple countries and is seen as discrediting Lebanon's democratic credentials. On a positive note, the report acknowledges the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of government practices.
