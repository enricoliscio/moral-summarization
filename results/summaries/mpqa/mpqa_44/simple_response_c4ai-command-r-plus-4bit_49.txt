SUMMARY: Local authorities express dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes Lebanon's government. The report, delivered to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, highlights concerns about the weakening of the central government's power and political pressure on the judiciary, while also acknowledging the independence of the judiciary "in principle." The monitoring of opposition politicians and phone tapping of government leaders is seen as a serious breach and a harm to Lebanon's image as a democratic country. Authorities plan to share the report with relevant ministries and provide their observations to the State Department, emphasizing factors beyond the government's control. They take issue with the report's portrayal of Lebanon as undemocratic and abusive of human rights, while also commending the Lebanese press for its critical role in daily government scrutiny. This annual exchange highlights the sensitive nature of human rights assessments and their potential impact on a country's international image. END OF SUMMARY.
