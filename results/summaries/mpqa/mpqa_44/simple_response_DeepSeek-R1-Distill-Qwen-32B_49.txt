Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Lebanese officials reacting to the US State Department's human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's government, judiciary, and mentions intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians, which the officials see as harming Lebanon's image. They also point out that the report's criticisms aren't unique to Lebanon and that they send explanations each year about factors beyond their control. The press is praised in the report, though.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the dissatisfaction, the specific criticisms, and the context that this is an annual occurrence. Also, highlight the impact on Lebanon's image and the annual explanations they provide. Keep it under 200 words and end with the tokens as instructed.

Let me structure it: start with the officials' reaction, mention the report's criticisms, their response, the annual nature, the specific points like judiciary and intelligence, the image impact, and the press praise. Make sure it's concise but covers all key moral points.
