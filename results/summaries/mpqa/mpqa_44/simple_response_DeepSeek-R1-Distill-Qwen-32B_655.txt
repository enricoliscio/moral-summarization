Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Lebanese officials reacting to the US State Department's human rights report. They're dissatisfied but not surprised. The report criticizes Lebanon's weakening central government, judicial independence, and mentions intelligence monitoring of opposition politicians. It also praises the Lebanese press for criticizing the government.

I need to capture the key elements: the officials' reaction, the specific criticisms, the praise for the press, and the context that this happens annually. I should also note that the report affects Lebanon's image.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the officials' response, the contents of the report, and the annual nature of the criticism. Also, mention how the report affects Lebanon's image as democratic.

Let me make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the original text.
