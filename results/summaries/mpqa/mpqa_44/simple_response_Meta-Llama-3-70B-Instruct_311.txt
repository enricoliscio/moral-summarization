SUMMARY:

Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the country's weakening central government and alleged human rights abuses. The report is seen as discrediting Lebanon and portraying it as undemocratic or uncivilized. Authorities take issue with the report's observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, and that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap government leaders' phones. These points are seen as harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The government plans to respond to the report, citing factors outside of its control. This is an annual ritual, with Lebanon sending explanations to the State Department each year. The report's criticism is not unique to Lebanon, but covers several other countries as well.
