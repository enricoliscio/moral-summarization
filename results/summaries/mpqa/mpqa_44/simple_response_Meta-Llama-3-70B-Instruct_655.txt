SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked dissatisfaction among Lebanese officials, who feel it discredits their country by portraying it as undemocratic and uncivilized. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority and alleges that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure. It also raises concerns about intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones, which officials see as harmful to Lebanon's democratic image. However, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Officials have conveyed their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador and will respond to the report, citing factors outside of their control. This annual criticism is seen as a routine event, covering multiple countries. The report's negative portrayal of Lebanon's human rights record is a moral concern, as it undermines the country's reputation and raises questions about its commitment to democratic values.
