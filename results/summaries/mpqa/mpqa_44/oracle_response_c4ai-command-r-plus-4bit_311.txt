SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express their dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual report on human rights, which criticizes the country's record. The report, delivered to the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, is seen as discrediting Lebanon by portraying it as undemocratic, uncivilized, and abusing human rights. Authorities are particularly unhappy with the report's observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure and that intelligence agents monitor opposition politicians and tap the phones of government leaders. These actions are seen as harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country. While the report criticizes the weakening of the central government's prerogatives, it praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government and its practices. The Lebanese government plans to send its explanations to the State Department, addressing factors beyond their control, as they do every year.
