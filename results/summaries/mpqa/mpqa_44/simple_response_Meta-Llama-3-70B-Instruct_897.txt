SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights has sparked dissatisfaction among Lebanese officials, who view the criticism as an annual event targeting not only Lebanon but several other countries as well. The report criticizes the weakening of the central government's authority and portrays Lebanon as undemocratic and uncivilized, which officials see as discrediting the country. The most serious concern is the report's observation that the judiciary is subjected to political pressure, despite being "independent in principle." The report also highlights intelligence agents' monitoring of opposition politicians and tapping of government leaders' phones, harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country. On a positive note, the report praises the Lebanese press for its daily criticism of the government. Officials plan to respond to the report, citing factors outside of the government's control, and will convey their dissatisfaction to the US Ambassador.
