SUMMARY: Lebanese officials express dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes the weakening of the central government and the judicial system in Lebanon. The report also mentions intelligence agents monitoring opposition politicians and tapping government leaders' phones, which is seen as harming Lebanon's image as a democratic country. Lebanese authorities plan to send their observations to the State Department, emphasizing that human rights issues are not unique to Lebanon and that external factors beyond the government's control influence the situation. The report, however, acknowledges the vibrant role of the Lebanese press in criticizing government practices.
