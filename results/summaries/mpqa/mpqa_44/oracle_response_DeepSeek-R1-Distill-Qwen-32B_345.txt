Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words: weakening, undemocratic, uncivilized, abusing, subjected, tapping. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Lebanese officials are upset about the US human rights report. They find the criticism annual and not just about Lebanon. The report mentions weakening central government, which is a moral issue. They also mention Lebanon being portrayed as undemocratic and uncivilized, which are strong moral terms.

The report criticizes the judiciary being subjected to political pressure, using "subjected" as a moral term. It also talks about intelligence agents tapping phones, using "tapping." The officials are conveying their dissatisfaction to the US ambassador. They explain that some factors are beyond their control. The report also mentions the press being critical, which is a positive note.

I need to structure the summary to include all these points concisely, using the moral words. I should start with the officials' reaction, mention the specific criticisms, and note the positive aspect about the press. Keep it under 200 words.

I'll make sure each moral term is included where appropriate. For example, "weakening," "undemocratic," "uncivilized," "abusing," "subjected," and "tapping." Also, mention how the report affects Lebanon's image.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without losing the moral framing. Make sure it flows well and covers all key points from the article.

SUMMARY: Lebanese officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the US State Department's annual human rights report, which they view as an annual criticism not exclusive to Lebanon. The report accuses the central government of "weakening" its prerogatives and portrays the country as "undemocratic" and "uncivilized," while "abusing" human rights. It also claims the judiciary is "subjected" to political pressure and intelligence agents are "tapping" phones of opposition politicians and government leaders, harming Lebanon's democratic image. The Foreign Ministry plans to distribute the report to relevant ministries before responding to the US. Officials conveyed their displeasure to US Ambassador Vincent Battle and emphasized that some issues are beyond their control. The report, however, praises Lebanon's press for its critical coverage of the government. END OF SUMMARY.
