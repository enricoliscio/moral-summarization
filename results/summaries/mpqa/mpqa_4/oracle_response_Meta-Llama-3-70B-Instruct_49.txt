SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international outcry over alleged human rights violations. Rumsfeld dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole" and claimed that the prisoners were being treated humanely. However, critics argue that the US is using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners, violating Geneva Convention rules. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have expressed concerns, with the latter calling for prisoner of war status and access to lawyers. Rumsfeld justified the use of restraints, saying it was necessary to prevent prisoners from killing American soldiers. He also emphasized the importance of extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks. The controversy has sparked debate over the US's obligations under the Geneva Convention, with some governments calling for prisoner of war status and others supporting the US position.
