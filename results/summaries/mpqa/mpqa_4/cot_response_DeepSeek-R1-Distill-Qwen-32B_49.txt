Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking. They provided a detailed article about Rumsfeld defending the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, write a concise summary using those words as much as possible.

Alright, starting with STEP 1: Identifying morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "outcry," "defended," "hyperbole," "humanely," "criticism," "sensory deprivation," "psychological," "humiliation," " Geneva Convention," "protection," "values," "terrorism," "prisoners of war," "isolated," "domination," "futility," "intelligence," "terrorists," "legal limbo," "jurisdiction." These words are key to the moral arguments presented.

Now, for the summary. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and includes as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by stating Rumsfeld's defense, mention the outcry, his dismissal of criticism as hyperbole, and his claim that treatment is humane. Then, I'll note the international criticism about sensory deprivation and psychological techniques, citing the Red Cross and Amnesty International. Mention the Geneva Convention concerns and the stance of different countries. Highlight the US focus on extracting intelligence, the legal limbo, and the lack of prisoner of war status. Conclude with the judge's uncertainty over jurisdiction. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral aspects without being too detailed.

I should avoid adding any new information not in the article and keep it concise. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear through the use of the identified words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international outcry as hyperbole. He claimed the prisoners were treated humanely, though critics accused the U.S. of using sensory deprivation and psychological techniques to weaken them. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the U.S. for potentially violating the Geneva Convention by making a spectacle of the prisoners. Some governments, including the EU and the Netherlands, called for prisoner of war status for the detainees, emphasizing the need to uphold values and norms. While Britain and Spain supported the U.S., Rumsfeld acknowledged the legal limbo surrounding the detainees' status, stating they were not officially classified as prisoners of war. He emphasized the priority of extracting intelligence to prevent future attacks, though no interrogations had taken place. The U.S. faced criticism for not allowing detainees access to lawyers or identifying them publicly. A federal judge in Los Angeles expressed doubts about jurisdiction over the detainees' legal challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
