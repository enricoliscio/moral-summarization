Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld defending the US treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay. There's an international outcry over the photos released, showing prisoners in restraints. Rumsfeld claims they're treated humanely and dismisses criticism as exaggerated. He argues that restraining dangerous prisoners is necessary for safety.

On the other hand, critics, including Amnesty International and the Red Cross, argue that the US is using techniques like sensory deprivation, which violates the Geneva Convention. They want the prisoners to have legal rights and access to lawyers.

Some countries support the US, like Britain and Spain, while others, like the EU and the Netherlands, are critical, emphasizing the importance of upholding values. The article also mentions that the prisoners aren't classified as POWs, leaving them in legal limbo, and that interrogations haven't taken place yet.

I need to capture these points concisely, ensuring the moral arguments from both sides are clear. I should mention Rumsfeld's defense, the critics' concerns, the support and criticism from different countries, the legal issues, and the lack of interrogations.

Let me structure this into a coherent summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes the moral framing as presented.

The release of photos showing prisoners in restraints sparked global condemnation, with some governments urging the U.S. to grant prisoners POW status for better protections. Rumsfeld emphasized extracting intelligence to prevent future attacks, though no interrogations had occurred. The prisoners remain in legal limbo, with no clear designation under the Geneva Conventions. Some countries, like Britain and Spain, supported the U.S., while others, such as the EU and the Netherlands, criticized the approach, stressing the importance of upholding values. END OF SUMMARY.
