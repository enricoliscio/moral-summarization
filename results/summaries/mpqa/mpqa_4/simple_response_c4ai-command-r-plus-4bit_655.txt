SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Cuba, arguing that they were being treated humanely and that the recent photographs released by the Defense Department were taken out of context. He dismissed the criticism as exaggerated and asserted that the use of restraints and sensory deprivation techniques was necessary to ensure the safety of American soldiers and prevent future attacks. While some governments and human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, criticized the United States for its treatment of the prisoners and called for their recognition as prisoners of war, others, including Britain and Spain, supported the U.S. position. The debate surrounding the legal status and treatment of the detainees in Cuba highlighted the challenges of balancing security concerns with upholding moral values and international legal obligations.
