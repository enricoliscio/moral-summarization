Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Rumsfeld defending U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo. The author uses words like "tap," "violated," "spectacle," etc., so I need to include those.

The main points are Rumsfeld's defense, the release of photos causing international outcry, accusations of sensory deprivation, Geneva Convention violations, and support from some countries. I should mention Rumsfeld's dismissal of criticism as hyperbole and his emphasis on humane treatment.

I need to highlight the moral issues, like the use of restraints, humiliation, and the legal limbo of detainees. Also, the debate over prisoner of war status and the U.S. focus on extracting information. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the listed moral words as possible.

Let me structure it: start with Rumsfeld's defense, mention the photos and criticism, the techniques used, international reactions, support from some allies, and the legal issues. Make sure to use words like "tap," "violated," "spectacle," "humiliation," etc.

I need to avoid adding my own opinions, just stick to summarizing the article's moral framing. Also, end with the judge's doubt about jurisdiction. Let me piece it together now, keeping it within the word limit and including the key moral terms.

SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed all prisoners were treated humanely, despite photos showing them restrained, masked, and blindfolded, which critics argued violated the Geneva Convention by creating a "spectacle." The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the use of sensory deprivation and humiliation, such as shaving, to "break" prisoners before interrogation. Rumsfeld acknowledged the photos' release was "unfortunate" but defended restraints as necessary for safety. He emphasized extracting intelligence to "prevent future attacks," though no interrogations had occurred, and detainees lacked legal status or access to lawyers. The U.S. faced pressure to designate them as prisoners of war, with allies like Britain and Spain supporting the U.S., while others urged adherence to norms and values. The legal limbo and delay in determining their status raised concerns. Rumsfeld acknowledged the complexity of applying Geneva rules to non-state actors like Al Qaeda. A U.S. judge questioned jurisdiction over the detainees' rights. END OF SUMMARY.
