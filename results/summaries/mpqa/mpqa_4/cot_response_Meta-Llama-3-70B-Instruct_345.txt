SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." He claimed that the prisoners were treated "humanely" and that there was no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argued that the use of sensory deprivation, shackles, and humiliation was a violation of the Geneva Convention and amounted to "inhumane" treatment. Rumsfeld countered that the restraints were necessary to prevent prisoners from harming American soldiers, and that it would be "stupid" to do otherwise. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International joined the chorus of criticism, urging the US to grant the detainees prisoner of war status and access to lawyers. Rumsfeld maintained that the priority was to extract information from the "committed terrorists" to prevent future attacks, but critics argued that the US was compromising its "values" and "norms" in the process.
