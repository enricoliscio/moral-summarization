SUMMARY:
Amid an international outcry, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing criticism as hyperbole. Critics argued that the US violated the Geneva Convention by distributing photographs of prisoners in restraints, sensory deprivation, and other psychological techniques. Amnesty International and the Red Cross joined the chorus of criticism, with the latter stating that the US might have violated the Geneva Convention by making a spectacle of prisoners. 

The debate centered on whether the detainees should be granted prisoner of war status, which would afford them greater protections. While some governments urged POW status, others supported the US, arguing that the prisoners had no complaints about their treatment. 

Mr. Rumsfeld acknowledged the priority of extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks but denied any inhumane treatment, stating that the detainees were being treated humanely and kept off the streets to ensure public safety. He attributed the controversy to legal technicalities and the challenge of dealing with prisoners from terrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda, which are not covered by the Geneva Conventions in the same way as prisoners from countries. 

Officials at Guantanamo confirmed that no interrogations had taken place and that the prisoners did not have lawyers, raising questions about the benefit of withholding POW status. END OF SUMMARY.
