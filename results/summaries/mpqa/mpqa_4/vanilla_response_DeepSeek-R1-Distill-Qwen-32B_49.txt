Alright, I need to summarize this article about Rumsfeld defending the treatment of detainees in Cuba. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points. 

First, Rumsfeld is responding to international criticism, so I'll mention that. He's dismissing the criticism as exaggerated. The article talks about the photos released showing prisoners in restraints, which caused a lot of backlash. I should include that detail.

Critics are saying the US is using psychological techniques, and organizations like the Red Cross and Amnesty International are involved. I'll note their concerns about Geneva Convention violations and the call for prisoner of war status.

Support from Britain and Spain is a key point, so I'll include that. Also, Rumsfeld's stance on the necessity of restraints for safety, and the legal limbo the detainees are in. The lack of interrogations and lawyers is important too.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise. I'll start with Rumsfeld's defense, mention the criticism, the photos, the arguments from both sides, and the legal issues. End with the uncertainty about their status and the international debate. That should cover all the essential elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing international criticism as exaggerated. He claimed no evidence of inhumane treatment, despite photos showing prisoners in restraints and masks sparking outrage. Critics accused the U.S. of using sensory deprivation and psychological techniques to weaken prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the treatment, with the latter calling for access to prisoners and legal representation. Some governments, including Britain and Spain, supported the U.S., while others urged prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld emphasized the priority of extracting intelligence to prevent attacks, though no interrogations had occurred. He acknowledged the legal ambiguity, as detainees were not classified as prisoners of war, complicating their status. The debate over their treatment and legal rights continued internationally.  
END OF SUMMARY.
