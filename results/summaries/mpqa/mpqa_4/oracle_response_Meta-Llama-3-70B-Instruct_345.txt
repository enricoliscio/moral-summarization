SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international outcry over alleged human rights violations. Rumsfeld dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole" and claimed that the detainees were being treated humanely. However, critics argue that the US is using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners, violating Geneva Convention rules. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have spoken out against the treatment, with the latter calling for the detainees to be granted prisoner of war status. Several governments have joined the chorus, urging the US to uphold its values and norms. Rumsfeld countered that the detainees are being restrained for their own safety and to prevent future attacks, but critics argue that this is a form of "humiliation" and "control". The US has not officially designated the detainees as prisoners of war, leaving them in "legal limbo".
