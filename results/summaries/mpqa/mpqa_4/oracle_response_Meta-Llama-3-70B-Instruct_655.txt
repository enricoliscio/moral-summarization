SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international outcry over alleged human rights violations. Rumsfeld dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole" and claimed that the detainees were being treated humanely. However, critics argued that the US was using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners, violating Geneva Convention rules. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressed concerns, with the latter calling for the detainees to be granted prisoner of war status. Several governments, including the European Union and the Netherlands, also urged the US to recognize the detainees as prisoners of war. Rumsfeld argued that the detainees were being restrained for safety reasons and that it was necessary to extract information from them to prevent future attacks. Despite this, officials at Guantanamo admitted that no interrogations had taken place and the prisoners did not have lawyers. The moral implications of the US's actions were clear, with critics arguing that the country was compromising its values and upholding a "spectacle" of human rights violations.
