SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." Despite photos showing prisoners in shackles and masks, Rumsfeld claimed they were treated "humanely" and that the US had not "violated" Geneva Convention rules. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, argued that the US was using "sensory deprivation" and "humiliation" to break prisoners' spirits. They called for the detainees to be granted prisoner of war status, which would accord them higher protections. Rumsfeld justified the use of restraints, saying it was necessary to "prevent" attacks and "keep" dangerous prisoners from killing American soldiers. He also emphasized the importance of extracting information from the prisoners to "prevent" future attacks. The controversy highlights the moral dilemma of balancing national security with human rights and the rule of law.
