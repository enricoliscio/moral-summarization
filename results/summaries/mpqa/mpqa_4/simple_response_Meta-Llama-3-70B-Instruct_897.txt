SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are treated humanely and that the released photographs showing them in restraints are being misinterpreted. However, critics argue that the US is using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners for interrogation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have expressed concerns, with the latter calling for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Several governments have also joined the criticism, while Britain and Spain have supported the US. Rumsfeld's defense of the treatment raises moral questions about the balance between national security and human rights.
