SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Cuba, arguing that they were being treated humanely and that the recent outcry over their treatment was exaggerated and sensationalized. He dismissed concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques, stating that the use of restraints and isolation was necessary for the safety of American soldiers. The debate surrounds the legal status of the detainees, with critics arguing that they should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention, while the US has not officially designated them as such. Rumsfeld justifies this by stating that the Geneva Conventions protect prisoners from countries, not terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda, which some of the detainees belong to. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have criticized the US, with the latter calling for the detainees to be allowed access to lawyers. The moral dilemma surrounds the balance between upholding human rights and ensuring national security, with critics arguing that the US has crossed ethical boundaries in its treatment of detainees. Rumsfeld, on the other hand, justifies the treatment as necessary to prevent future attacks and protect American lives. END OF SUMMARY.
