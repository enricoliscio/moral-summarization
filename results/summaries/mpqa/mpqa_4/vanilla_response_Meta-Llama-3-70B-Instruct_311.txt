SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." The controversy arose after photos were released showing prisoners kneeling, shackled, and blindfolded. Critics accused the US of using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners for interrogation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressed concern, and several governments called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld argued that the restraints were necessary for transportation and that the prisoners were being treated similarly to POWs, but without official designation. He prioritized extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks, but officials at Guantanamo said no interrogations had taken place and the prisoners did not have lawyers.
