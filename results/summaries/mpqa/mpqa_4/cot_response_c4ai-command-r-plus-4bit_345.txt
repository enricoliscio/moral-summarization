SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the treatment of prisoners in Cuba amidst an international outcry, dismissing criticisms of inhumane practices as hyperbole. He asserted that the detainees are being treated humanely and that the recent photographs do not reflect the entirety of the context. Rumsfeld acknowledged the priority of extracting information from the prisoners, whom he described as "committed terrorists," to prevent future attacks. However, the refusal to classify the captives as prisoners of war has drawn criticism and legal scrutiny, with some arguing that the prisoners should be granted POW status under the Geneva Convention. The debate centers on the balance between upholding norms and values while also effectively dealing with dangerous and committed terrorists. The moral complexities of the situation are underscored by the involvement of prisoners from a range of countries, as well as the presence of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. END OF SUMMARY.
