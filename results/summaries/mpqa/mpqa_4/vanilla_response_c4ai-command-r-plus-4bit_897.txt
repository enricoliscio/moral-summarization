SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism and concerns about the use of sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques. Rumsfeld stated that the prisoners were being treated humanely and that restraints were necessary for the safety of American soldiers. He also addressed the delay in officially designating the detainees as prisoners of war, citing legal complexities regarding terrorist organizations. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the US for possible violations of the Geneva Conventions and the right to legal representation, respectively. Criticism also came from several governments and human rights organizations. In contrast, Britain and Spain supported the US, with Prime Minister Tony Blair's office stating that British prisoners had no complaints about their treatment. Meanwhile, a federal district judge in Los Angeles questioned his jurisdiction over a challenge to the detention of prisoners in Cuba. END OF SUMMARY.
