Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rumsfeld defending the treatment of detainees in Cuba. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rumsfeld is frustrated with international criticism about how the US is treating prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. He's trying to defend the US conduct, calling the criticism "hyperbole." He says he's talked to people there via secure video and hasn't found any evidence of inhumane treatment. 

Then, there are details about the photos released showing prisoners with shackles, masks, and goggles. Critics argue that the US is using sensory deprivation and psychological techniques to interrogate them. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International are criticizing the US for violating Geneva Convention rules and not allowing prisoners to have lawyers.

Some governments, like the EU and Netherlands, are urging the US to recognize the prisoners as POWs, which would give them more protections. However, the US hasn't done that, and Rumsfeld says they're treated similarly to POWs but aren't officially classified as such. He mentions that the Geneva Conventions don't cover terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. 

There's also support from Britain and Spain, saying their nationals aren't complaining. The warden at Guantanamo is focused on maintaining control, and Rumsfeld defends the use of restraints during transport. He admits it was a mistake to release the photos without explanation. The legal status of the prisoners is unclear, and a judge in LA is questioning his authority to handle their detention.

So, the main points are: Rumsfeld defends the treatment, criticism about psychological tactics and Geneva Convention violations, international support and opposition, legal limbo of prisoners, and the release of photos causing controversy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Rumsfeld's defense, the criticism from international bodies, the support from some countries, the legal issues, and the photo controversy. Also, mention that prisoners don't have lawyers and the debate over POW status.

Let me structure it: Start with Rumsfeld's defense, mention the photos and criticism, the support and opposition, the legal aspects, and the POW status debate. Keep it concise, making sure each point is covered briefly.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point, just hit the key elements. Make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next without being too choppy.

Also, check the word count to stay under 200. Maybe combine some sentences where possible to save words. For example, instead of saying "critics argue psychological tactics" and "Amnesty International says..." I can combine that into one sentence.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as exaggerated. He stated that prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showing them in restraints sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, accused the U.S. of violating the Geneva Convention by making prisoners a spectacle and denying them legal rights. Some governments, like the EU and Netherlands, urged POW status for detainees, while others, such as Britain and Spain, supported U.S. actions. Rumsfeld noted that prisoners were treated similarly to POWs but weren't officially classified as such, citing Geneva Convention limitations for terrorist groups. The legal status of detainees remains unresolved, with a U.S. judge questioning jurisdiction over their detention. END OF SUMMARY.
