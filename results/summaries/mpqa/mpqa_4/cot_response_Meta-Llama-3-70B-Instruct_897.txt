SUMMARY:
 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." He claimed that the prisoners are treated "humanely" and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argue that the use of sensory deprivation, shackles, and humiliation amounts to "inhumane" treatment. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have expressed concerns, with the latter stating that the US is using "classic techniques" to break the prisoners' spirits. Rumsfeld countered that the prisoners are "committed terrorists" and that the US is keeping them off the streets to prevent future attacks. The debate has sparked a discussion on the importance of upholding "values" and "norms" in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
