SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. The criticism arose after photos were released showing prisoners kneeling, shackled, and blindfolded. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accused the US of using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners. Several governments, including the European Union and the Netherlands, called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. However, Britain and Spain supported the US position. Rumsfeld argued that the photos were taken out of context and that the prisoners are being treated as prisoners of war, despite not being officially designated as such.
