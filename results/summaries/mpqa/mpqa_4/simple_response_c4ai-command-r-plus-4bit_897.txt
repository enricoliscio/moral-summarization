SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld staunchly defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Cuba amid growing international criticism. He dismissed claims of inhumane treatment, stating that the prisoners are being handled humanely and securely. Rumsfeld acknowledged the release of controversial photographs but argued that the use of restraints during transportation was necessary for the safety of American soldiers. He emphasized the priority of extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks and highlighted the challenge of determining their legal status, particularly for those belonging to terrorist organizations. Critics, including Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, argue that the United States may have violated Geneva Convention rules and that the prisoners should be granted prisoner-of-war status. Several governments have joined the chorus of criticism, while Britain and Spain have supported the US. The debate surrounds the balance between security and moral obligations, with Rumsfeld emphasizing the need to protect American lives and critics advocating for the rights and humane treatment of prisoners.
