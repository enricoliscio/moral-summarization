SUMMARY:
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid an international outcry. Rumsfeld dismissed the criticism as hyperbole and asserted that the detainees were being treated humanely. However, critics argued that the United States was employing sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners for interrogation. The release of photographs depicting shackled and bound prisoners sparked further controversy, with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressing concern over potential violations of the Geneva Convention. 

The debate centered on the detainees' status, with several governments advocating for their recognition as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld acknowledged the legal complexities, noting the challenge of granting Geneva Convention protections to members of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. He emphasized the priority of extracting information from the detainees to prevent future attacks and reiterated his belief that they were being treated appropriately. 

The situation highlighted the ethical dilemma of balancing security needs with humane treatment, and the moral implications of legal technicalities surrounding prisoner status. The United States faced criticism for its handling of the detainees, particularly regarding the use of restraints, isolation, and potential violations of international law.
