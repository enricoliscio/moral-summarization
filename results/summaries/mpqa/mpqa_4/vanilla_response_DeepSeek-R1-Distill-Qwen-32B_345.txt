Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rumsfeld defending the US treatment of detainees in Cuba. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Rumsfeld is frustrated with international criticism about how prisoners are treated at Guantanamo Bay. He's defending the US conduct, calling the criticism exaggerated. He claims that all prisoners are treated humanely and has seen no evidence to the contrary.

Then, the article describes the photos released by the Defense Department showing prisoners in restraints, which sparked criticism. Critics argue that the US is using psychological techniques like sensory deprivation to make interrogations more effective. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International are involved, with the former saying the US might have violated Geneva Convention rules by distributing the photos. Amnesty wants access for lawyers.

Several governments are criticizing the US, wanting prisoners to be recognized as POWs under Geneva Convention for higher protections. The EU and the Netherlands are examples. On the other hand, Britain and Spain support the US, with their prisoners not complaining. The warden at Camp X-Ray is focused on maintaining control, and a retired general explains the psychological tactics used.

Rumsfeld mentions that releasing the photos was probably a mistake but defends the restraints as necessary for safety. He's unsure about legal designations and says the priority is extracting information. The prisoners are from various countries, complicating legal matters. A judge in LA is questioning his jurisdiction to challenge their detention.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Rumsfeld's defense, the criticism from international bodies and governments, the psychological tactics, the legal issues, and the support from some countries. Also, mention the judge's doubt about jurisdiction.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Rumsfeld's defense, then the criticisms, the psychological methods, the legal status, and the international reactions, ending with the legal challenges.

Let me make sure I hit all key points without getting too detailed. Avoiding specific names unless necessary. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
