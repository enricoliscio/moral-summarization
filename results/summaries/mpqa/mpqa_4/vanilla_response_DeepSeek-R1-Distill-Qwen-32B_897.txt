Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rumsfeld defending the treatment of detainees in Cuba. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Rumsfeld defended the U.S. conduct at Guantanamo Bay, countering international criticism. He claims all prisoners are treated humanely and dismisses the criticism as exaggerated. He mentions spending time with the people there and hasn't found any inhumane treatment.

Then, it talks about the release of photos showing prisoners in restraints, which caused a lot of criticism. Critics argue that the U.S. is using psychological techniques to make interrogations more effective. The Red Cross and Amnesty International are mentioned, with the Red Cross breaking their usual code to criticize the U.S. for possibly violating the Geneva Convention by making a spectacle of the prisoners. Amnesty wants access to the prisoners and for them to have lawyers.

Several governments are criticizing the U.S., saying the prisoners should be recognized as prisoners of war (POWs) under the Geneva Convention, which would give them more protections. Rumsfeld says the U.S. hasn't designated them as POWs because they belong to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, which aren't recognized under the Geneva Conventions. He also mentions that the U.S. hasn't interrogated them yet and is focused on gathering intelligence to prevent future attacks.

Some countries support the U.S., like Britain and Spain, while others, like the Netherlands, urge the U.S. to recognize them as POWs. The warden at Guantanamo says they maintain "positive control" over the prisoners, which involves psychological tactics. Rumsfeld defends the use of restraints, saying it's necessary for safety, especially with dangerous prisoners.

The article also mentions legal issues, like the prisoners being in a legal limbo and the lack of official designation as POWs. There's a judge in Los Angeles questioning his jurisdiction over the detainees.

So, to summarize, the key points are:
- Rumsfeld defends U.S. treatment of detainees, denying inhumane treatment.
- International criticism over photos showing restraints and psychological tactics.
- Critics argue the U.S. is violating Geneva Conventions.
- Some countries support the U.S., others criticize.
- Legal issues: detainees not classified as POWs, no interrogations yet.
- Rumsfeld focuses on intelligence gathering.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include Rumsfeld's defense, the criticism, the legal aspects, and the international reactions. I'll avoid getting too bogged down in specifics, just hit the main points.
