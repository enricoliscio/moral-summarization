SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international outcry over the use of sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques. Rumsfeld dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole" and claimed that the prisoners were being treated humanely. However, critics argued that the US was violating Geneva Convention rules by making a spectacle of prisoners and using tactics to break their spirit. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International condemned the treatment, with the latter calling for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status. Rumsfeld justified the use of restraints, saying it was necessary to prevent prisoners from killing American soldiers. He also emphasized the need to extract information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks. Despite the controversy, Rumsfeld maintained that the US was upholding its values and norms in the fight against terrorism.
