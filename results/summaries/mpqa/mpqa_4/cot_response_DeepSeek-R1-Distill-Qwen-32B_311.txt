Okay, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "outcry," "defended," "hyperbole," "humanely," "criticism," "sensory deprivation," "psychological," "humiliation," "values," "protection," "isolated," "domination," "futility," "rewards," "unfortunate," "restraints," "kill," "inhumane," "stupid," "terrorists," "committing," "limbo," "screening," "intelligence," "precedent," "jurisdiction." These words are key because they reflect the moral judgment in the article.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words, keeping those moral terms. I'll start by outlining the main points: Rumsfeld defending US treatment, international criticism, the Geneva Convention, human rights concerns, support from some countries, and the legal limbo of the detainees. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Rumsfeld's defense, then moving to the criticisms, the support, and ending with the legal and moral implications. I need to be concise but comprehensive, ensuring each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

Also, I should check that the summary accurately reflects the original article's moral framing, not just the facts. Words like "outcry," "criticism," "inhumane," and "values" are crucial to convey the moral stance. I'll make sure these are included to preserve the author's tone.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that all the key moral points are addressed. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed the prisoners were treated "humanely," but images showing detainees in shackles and masks sparked accusations of "sensory deprivation" and "humiliation." Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, argued the U.S. violated Geneva Convention rules and used psychological tactics to "break" prisoners. Some countries, like Britain and Spain, supported the U.S., while others, such as the Netherlands and the EU, urged prisoner of war status for detainees. Rumsfeld emphasized extracting intelligence to prevent future attacks, but the detainees remain in "legal limbo" without lawyers or formal classification. The U.S. has not designated them as prisoners of war, complicating legal and moral responsibilities. The debate over their treatment highlights tensions between security and human rights, with critics warning against compromising values in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
