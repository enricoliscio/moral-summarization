SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as hyperbole. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners were being treated humanely and that restraints were necessary for transportation to prevent harm to American soldiers. The release of photographs depicting the prisoners in shackles, masks, and goggles sparked outrage, with critics alleging sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques. The Red Cross and Amnesty International joined the chorus of criticism, with the former suggesting a violation of Geneva Convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners and the latter calling for access to lawyers for the detainees. Rumsfeld acknowledged the delay in officially designating the detainees' status but attributed it to legal complexities surrounding terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. The moral framing of this article revolves around the use of restraints, the violation of Geneva Convention rules, and the potential for sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to break the prisoners' spirits.
