Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rumsfeld is defending the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo, countering international criticism. The photos showing prisoners in restraints have sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological control. International groups like the Red Cross and Amnesty are involved, criticizing the U.S. for violating the Geneva Convention. Some countries support the U.S., while others don't. The detainees are in legal limbo, and there's no official designation as prisoners of war.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list. Words like "tap," "violated," "spectacle," "distributing," "published," "keeping," "use," "humiliation," "shaving," "atrocities," "changing," "victory," "uphold," "control," "imposing," "establish," "restrained," "kill," "designated," "determining," "delay," "prevent," "attacks," "interrogation."

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. Start with Rumsfeld's defense, mention the photos and the criticism. Include the Red Cross and Amnesty's points. Note the support from some countries and the legal issues. Highlight the lack of designation as POWs and the delay in screening.

I need to keep the summary concise, around 200 words. Make sure each sentence flows logically, connecting the moral implications as presented in the article. Avoid adding personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral language used.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Rumsfeld defending the treatment, then mention the photos and the international outcry. Include the specific criticisms about sensory deprivation and psychological control. Note the Red Cross's rare public criticism. Mention the support from Britain and Spain. Highlight the legal limbo and the delay in designation. End with the focus on extracting information to prevent attacks, tying back to the moral framing.

I think that covers all the key points and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it too wordy. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Looks good.

SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showing detainees in restraints sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological control. The International Committee of the Red Cross criticized the U.S. for violating Geneva Convention rules by making a "spectacle" of the prisoners. Amnesty International condemned the "humiliation" tactics, such as "shaving" prisoners, and called for access to lawyers. Some governments, like the EU and Netherlands, urged the U.S. to "uphold" values and grant prisoners of war status, while Britain and Spain supported the U.S. Rumsfeld acknowledged the photos may have been "unfortunate" but defended restraints as necessary for safety. He emphasized the U.S. priority of "preventing" future attacks by extracting information, though no interrogations had occurred. The detainees remain in legal limbo, with no official "designation" as prisoners of war, complicating the process of "determining" their status. END OF SUMMARY.
