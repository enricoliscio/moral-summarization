SUMMARY: In response to international criticism, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stating that they were being treated humanely and that criticism was exaggerated. The criticism arose after the release of photographs showing prisoners restrained and hooded. Amnesty International and the Red Cross expressed concern over potential human rights violations, with Amnesty seeking access to the prisoners and legal representation for them. Several governments joined the criticism, advocating for POW status for the detainees under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld acknowledged the delay in screening and determining the status of the prisoners but emphasized the priority of extracting information to prevent attacks. He attributed the delay partly to the legal complexities of granting Geneva Convention protections to members of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, a US federal judge questioned his jurisdiction over a challenge to the detention of prisoners in Cuba. END OF SUMMARY.
