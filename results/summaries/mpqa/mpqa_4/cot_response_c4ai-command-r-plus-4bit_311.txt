END OF SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees in Cuba amid international outcry and criticism. He dismissed concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological tactics, stating that the detainees are being treated humanely. Rumsfeld acknowledged the release of controversial photographs but argued that restraints are necessary for dangerous prisoners. The debate centers on whether the detainees should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention, which would provide them with additional protections. Critics argue that the United States is violating the Geneva Convention and employing inhumane tactics to break the detainees' spirits. Meanwhile, officials at Guantanamo Bay state that no interrogations have taken place, and the detainees do not have lawyers. The legal status of the detainees remains unclear, with some arguing they are in a state of legal limbo. Rumsfeld maintains that the priority is to extract information to prevent future attacks. The debate raises moral and legal questions about the treatment of detainees and the complexities of combating terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
