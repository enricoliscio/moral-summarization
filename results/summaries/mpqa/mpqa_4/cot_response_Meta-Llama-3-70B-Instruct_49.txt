SUMMARY:
 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." He claimed that the prisoners were treated "humanely" and that there was no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argued that the use of sensory deprivation, shackles, and other techniques was a form of "humiliation" and "psychological control" to break the prisoners' spirits. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International raised concerns about the treatment, with the latter calling for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners were "committed terrorists" and that the US was keeping them off the streets to prevent future attacks. Despite the controversy, Britain and Spain supported the US position. END OF SUMMARY.
