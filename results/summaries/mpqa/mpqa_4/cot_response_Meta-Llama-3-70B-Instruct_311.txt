SUMMARY:
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." He claimed that the prisoners are being treated "humanely" and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argue that the US is using "sensory deprivation" and "psychological control techniques" to weaken the prisoners, which is a violation of Geneva Convention rules. Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross have expressed concerns over the treatment of prisoners, with the latter stating that the US may have violated rules against making a spectacle of prisoners. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners are being kept in "positive control" to prevent them from harming American soldiers, but critics see this as a form of "isolation, domination, and futility." The debate has sparked a moral dilemma, with some arguing that the US should uphold its "values" and "norms" in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
