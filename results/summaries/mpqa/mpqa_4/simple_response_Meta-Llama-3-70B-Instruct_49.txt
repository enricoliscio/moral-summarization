SUMMARY:

US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and dismissed allegations of sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques as "breathless armchair hyperbole." However, human rights organizations like Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross have expressed concerns over the treatment of prisoners, including the use of restraints, masks, and goggles. They argue that these methods violate the Geneva Convention and amount to psychological torture. Rumsfeld's defense of the US actions has been met with skepticism, with many calling for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status and access to lawyers. The moral implications of the US treatment of detainees are significant, with critics arguing that the use of such techniques undermines the values of human dignity and respect for human rights.
