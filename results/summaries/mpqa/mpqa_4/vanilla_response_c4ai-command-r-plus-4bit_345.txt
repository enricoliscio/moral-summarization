SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following international criticism sparked by the release of photographs depicting prisoners in restraints, sensory deprivation, and humiliation. Rumsfeld denied any mistreatment and attributed the criticism to hyperbole. He argued that restraints were necessary for the safety of American soldiers during prisoner transportation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the United States for possible violations of the Geneva Convention and the use of sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. Several governments joined the criticism, advocating for prisoner of war status for the detainees, while Britain and Spain supported the U.S. Rumsfeld acknowledged the priority of extracting information from the prisoners and the legal complexities surrounding their classification, given their affiliation with terrorist organizations. Critics demanded the identification and legal representation of the detainees, while a federal judge questioned the jurisdiction over their detention. END OF SUMMARY.
