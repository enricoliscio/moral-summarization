SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism and outcry. Rumsfeld dismissed claims of inhumane treatment and sensory deprivation, stating that the detainees are being treated humanely and that restraints are necessary for the safety of American soldiers. He acknowledged that the release of photographs of restrained prisoners was unfortunate but argued that such measures are essential to maintain "positive control." The debate surrounds the legal status of the detainees, with critics arguing for their designation as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, which would grant them additional protections. Rumsfeld stated that the priority is to extract information from these "committed terrorists" to prevent future attacks, but critics argue that the United States is violating the Geneva Conventions by distributing photographs and keeping the detainees in legal limbo. Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross have joined the chorus of criticism, with the latter stating that the United States might have violated rules against making a spectacle of prisoners. The debate highlights the challenges of balancing security needs with upholding moral values and international legal obligations. END OF SUMMARY.
