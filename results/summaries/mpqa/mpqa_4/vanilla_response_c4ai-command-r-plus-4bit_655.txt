SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism and concerns over the release of photographs depicting the prisoners in restraints and sensory deprivation. Rumsfeld denied any inhumane treatment, stating that the prisoners were restrained for security reasons during transportation. He emphasized the priority of extracting information from the detainees to prevent future attacks and the legal complexities of designating them as prisoners of war, particularly those from terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. Criticism arose from organizations like Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as some foreign governments, regarding the use of sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. While some countries supported the US, others urged the recognition of detainees as prisoners of war, granting them legal protections under the Geneva Convention. Officials at Guantanamo stated that no interrogations had taken place and the prisoners did not have lawyers. The article also mentions a legal challenge to the detention of prisoners in Cuba, with a federal judge questioning the jurisdiction.
