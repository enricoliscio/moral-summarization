Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I'll have to identify the key points and condense them effectively.

First, the article is about Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld defending the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay. He's responding to international criticism, so that's a main point. The photos released over the weekend showing prisoners in restraints are a significant detail because they sparked the criticism.

Rumsfeld's defense includes stating that he's seen the detainees and hasn't found any inhumane treatment. He also addresses the release of photos, saying it was probably a mistake but defends the use of restraints for safety. That's an important point about the reasoning behind the restraints.

The international reaction is another key aspect. Organizations like the Red Cross and Amnesty International are criticizing the methods, mentioning sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. Some governments support the U.S., while others, like the EU and Netherlands, are urging better treatment under the Geneva Convention.

The legal aspect is also crucial. The detainees are in legal limbo, not classified as prisoners of war, which complicates their status. Rumsfeld mentions that they're treated as if they were POWs but without the official designation. The delay in determining their status is a point of contention.

Additionally, the article mentions that no interrogations have taken place yet, and the detainees don't have lawyers. There's a legal challenge in the U.S. questioning jurisdiction over the detainees.

I need to make sure the summary includes Rumsfeld's defense, the criticism from international bodies, the split in support from other countries, the legal status issue, and the ongoing debate about their treatment and rights.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: start with Rumsfeld's defense, move to the international criticism, mention the support from some countries, touch on the legal aspects, and conclude with the ongoing issues and legal challenges.

I should keep each sentence concise, avoiding unnecessary details. Also, ensure that the word count stays under 200. Let me check the main points again to make sure I haven't missed anything important.

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed no inhumane treatment had been observed, though photos showing prisoners in restraints sparked concerns. Critics accused the U.S. of using sensory deprivation and psychological tactics, with the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressing alarm. Some governments, including the EU and Netherlands, urged POW status for detainees, while others like Britain and Spain supported the U.S. Rumsfeld defended the use of restraints for safety, though he admitted the photo release may have been "unfortunate." The detainees remain in legal limbo, with no interrogations or lawyers. The U.S. has not officially designated them as POWs, complicating their status under the Geneva Conventions. A federal judge also questioned jurisdiction over the detainees. END OF SUMMARY.
