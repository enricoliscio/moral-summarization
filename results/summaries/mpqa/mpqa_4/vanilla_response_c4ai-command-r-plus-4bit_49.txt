SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following international criticism sparked by the release of photographs showing prisoners restrained and hooded. Rumsfeld denied any mistreatment and attributed the criticism to "hyperbole." He argued that restraints were necessary for the safety of American soldiers during prisoner transportation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International criticized the U.S., with the latter calling for access to prisoners and the provision of lawyers. Several governments joined the criticism, advocating for prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. However, Britain and Spain supported the U.S., and Colonel Terry Carrico, warden at Camp X-Ray, emphasized the need for "positive control" over prisoners. Rumsfeld acknowledged the priority of information extraction from prisoners and the legal complexities surrounding the designation of detainees as prisoners of war, particularly those from terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. Officials noted the diverse nationalities of the prisoners, further complicating their legal status. A federal district judge in Los Angeles questioned his jurisdiction over a challenge to the detention of prisoners in Cuba. END OF SUMMARY.
