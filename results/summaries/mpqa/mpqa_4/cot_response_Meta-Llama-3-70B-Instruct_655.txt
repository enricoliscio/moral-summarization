SUMMARY:
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the US treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." He claimed that the prisoners are treated "humanely" and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argue that the use of sensory deprivation, restraints, and humiliation amounts to "inhumane" treatment. Rumsfeld countered that these measures are necessary to prevent "dangerous and suicidal" prisoners from harming American soldiers. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have expressed concerns that the US may have violated Geneva Convention rules. Rumsfeld emphasized that the priority is to extract information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks, calling them "committed terrorists." The debate has sparked a moral dilemma, with some arguing that the US must uphold its "values" and "norms" in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
