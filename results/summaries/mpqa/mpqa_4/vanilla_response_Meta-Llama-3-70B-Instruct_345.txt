SUMMARY:

US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. The criticism arose after photos were released showing prisoners in restraints, sparking accusations of sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressed concerns, with the latter seeking access to the prisoners and calling for them to be granted prisoner of war status. Several governments, including the European Union and the Netherlands, also criticized the US, while Britain and Spain supported the US position. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners are being treated as prisoners of war in practice, but the US has not officially designated them as such. He stated that the priority is to extract information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks.
