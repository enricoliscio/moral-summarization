SUMMARY: Frustrated by international outcry, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing criticism as hyperbole. He argued that the prisoners were being treated humanely and that restraints were necessary for transportation to prevent harm to American soldiers. The release of photographs showing prisoners in shackles, bound, and with covered eyes and mouths, sparked criticism from international organizations and governments, who argued that the United States was using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to break the prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that the US might have violated Geneva Convention rules by distributing the photographs, while Amnesty International called for access to the prisoners and the provision of lawyers. Several governments joined the chorus, advocating for prisoner of war status for the detainees under the Geneva Convention. Mr. Rumsfeld acknowledged the priority of extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks but faced questions about the lack of official designation of the detainees as prisoners of war. Critics argued that the delay in screening and determination of status was unjustified.
