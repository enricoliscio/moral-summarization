Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Rumsfeld defending the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo. There's international criticism over photos showing prisoners in restraints. Critics argue the U.S. is using techniques like sensory deprivation, which violates Geneva Conventions. Rumsfeld dismisses the criticism as hyperbole and defends the methods, saying they're necessary for security. He mentions preventing future attacks and ensuring interrogations are effective. The detainees are in legal limbo, not designated as POWs, causing delays in their status. Some countries support the U.S., while others criticize. The summary needs to include the specified moral words and stay under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to cover Rumsfeld's defense, the international outcry, the techniques used, the legal issues, and the support/criticism from other countries. I'll make sure to use the moral terms like "tap," "violated," "spectacle," etc. I'll also need to keep the summary concise, focusing on the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary elements. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "breathless hyperbole." He claimed no evidence of inhumane treatment, though critics accused the U.S. of using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to facilitate interrogation. The release of photos showing prisoners in restraints sparked concerns over Geneva Convention violations, with the Red Cross calling it a "spectacle." Amnesty International criticized the "humiliation" of prisoners, including "shaving," and demanded access to lawyers. Rumsfeld acknowledged the photos were "unfortunate" but defended the use of restraints to prevent suicide or attacks on soldiers. He emphasized the priority of extracting intelligence to "prevent future attacks." However, the detainees remain in legal limbo, with no official designation as prisoners of war, complicating their status. Some countries, like Britain and Spain, supported the U.S., while others urged adherence to humanitarian norms. Rumsfeld acknowledged the legal complexities, particularly regarding terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda, and deferred to legal experts. The debate over detention practices continues, with critics arguing the U.S. must uphold its values to avoid "changing our way of life" in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
