Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rumsfeld is defending the US treatment of detainees in Guantanamo, countering international criticism. The author uses specific moral terms like "tap," "violated," "spectacle," etc., which I need to include.

I should start by identifying the key events: Rumsfeld's defense, the release of photos showing harsh treatment, international reactions, and the debate over prisoner status. I'll need to mention the criticism from organizations like the Red Cross and Amnesty International, using terms like "humiliation," "shaving," and "sensory deprivation."

I'll also note the support from Britain and Spain, the legal implications, and Rumsfeld's stance on preventing future attacks. It's important to include the moral framing words to convey the ethical concerns raised.

I'll structure the summary to cover Rumsfeld's defense, the criticism, the techniques used, international reactions, support from allies, legal issues, and the ongoing debate. I'll ensure each moral term is appropriately placed to reflect the author's framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check each sentence to see if it captures the moral angle and adjust as needed to maintain clarity and coherence.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed all prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showing shackled, masked prisoners sparked accusations of sensory deprivation and psychological control. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, argued the U.S. violated Geneva Convention rules by creating a "spectacle" and using techniques like "humiliation" and "shaving" to "break" prisoners' spirits. Several governments urged recognizing detainees as prisoners of war, emphasizing the need to "uphold" values. Rumsfeld countered that restraining dangerous prisoners was necessary to "prevent" attacks, though he acknowledged the photos may have been "unfortunate" to release. The U.S. has not officially "designated" the detainees as POWs, leaving them in "legal limbo." Rumsfeld emphasized extracting intelligence to "prevent" future attacks, but officials denied interrogations had occurred. The debate over "interrogation" techniques and "delayed" legal determinations continued, with critics warning against "changing" core values in the fight against terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
