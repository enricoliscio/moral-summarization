Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rumsfeld is defending the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo, facing international criticism. The article mentions photos showing prisoners restrained, which led to accusations of violating the Geneva Convention and using techniques like sensory deprivation. Rumsfeld argues that the methods are necessary for security and not inhumane. There's support from some countries but criticism from others. The detainees aren't classified as POWs, causing legal issues. The summary should include key points: Rumsfeld's defense, international outcry, specific criticisms, Rumsfeld's arguments, support and opposition, legal limbo, and the implications. I'll make sure to use as many of the provided moral words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the moral debate around the treatment methods and their justification for security.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showed them restrained, masked, and blindfolded, raising concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological control. Critics accused the U.S. of violating the Geneva Convention by creating a "spectacle" and using techniques to "break the spirit" of prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International condemned the treatment, while some governments, like the Netherlands and EU chief Javier Solana, urged recognizing detainees as prisoners of war to uphold values. Rumsfeld argued restraints were necessary to prevent attacks, but the legal status of detainees remained unclear, with no official designation as POWs. The U.S. prioritized extracting intelligence to "prevent future attacks," though no interrogations had occurred. The moral debate centered on whether the treatment, including "humiliation" and "control," aligned with international norms and values. END OF SUMMARY.
