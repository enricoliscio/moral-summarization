Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified a two-step process: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. These are words that imply right or wrong, good or bad, or have ethical implications. Let me read through the article again and note these words.

Looking at the article, the main points are about Rumsfeld defending the US treatment of detainees, international criticism, the use of restraints, sensory deprivation, psychological techniques, Geneva Convention violations, human rights groups like Amnesty International, and the legal status of prisoners.

So, the morally framed words I can identify are: criticize, hyperbole, humanely, violate, Geneva Convention, human rights, inhumane, torture, dignity, norms, values, justice, illegal, accountability, fairness, transparency, moral high ground, legal limbo, terrorism, justice, fairness, transparency, moral integrity, ethical standards, human rights, dignity, norms, values, justice, fairness, transparency, moral integrity, ethical standards, human rights, dignity, norms, values, justice, fairness, transparency, moral integrity, ethical standards.

Wait, some of these might be repeated or not in the article. Let me check each occurrence. For example, "criticize" appears when talking about international criticism. "Hyperbole" is used to dismiss the criticism as exaggerated. "Humanely" is Rumsfeld's claim about treatment. "Violate" comes up with the Geneva Convention. "Geneva Convention" itself is a legal and moral framework. "Human rights" are mentioned by groups like Amnesty International. "Inhumane" is used to describe possible treatment. "Torture" is implied through techniques like sensory deprivation. "Dignity" relates to how prisoners are treated. "Norms" and "values" are mentioned in the context of not changing them. "Justice" and "fairness" come up in legal discussions. "Transparency" is about the US being open. "Legal limbo" refers to the unclear status of prisoners. "Moral high ground" is about maintaining values. "Illegal" is about possible violations. "Accountability" relates to being answerable. "Fairness" and "transparency" are repeated.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, using as many of these moral words as possible. The key points are Rumsfeld's defense, international criticism, treatment methods, legal status, and the moral arguments on both sides.

I should start by stating Rumsfeld's defense, mention the criticism, describe the treatment methods, the Geneva Convention issues, the stance of human rights groups, the support from some countries, and the legal uncertainties. I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing words identified.

I'll structure it by first introducing Rumsfeld's defense, then the criticism, the methods used, the legal aspects, and the international reactions. Make sure to include words like criticize, hyperbole, humanely, violate, Geneva Convention, human rights, inhumane, dignity, norms, values, justice, fairness, transparency, legal limbo, moral high ground, illegal, accountability.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral dimensions involved.

**SUMMARY:**  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as exaggerated "hyperbole." He claimed prisoners were treated "humanely" and denied allegations of "inhumane" practices like sensory deprivation. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, accused the U.S. of violating the Geneva Convention by using psychological techniques to "break" prisoners' spirits. The release of photographs showing prisoners in restraints sparked global outrage, with some governments urging the U.S. to grant the detainees "prisoner of war" status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld argued that restraining dangerous prisoners was necessary for safety, but the lack of "transparency" and "accountability" raised concerns about "justice" and "fairness." The detainees remain in "legal limbo," with no clear designation under international law. The debate highlights the tension between national security and upholding "moral integrity" and "ethical standards." END OF SUMMARY.
