SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners were treated humanely and that there was no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argue that the US is using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners for interrogation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have expressed concerns, and several governments have called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld dismissed the criticism, saying that the photographs of prisoners in restraints were taken out of context and that the US is prioritizing extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks.

The moral framing of this article highlights the tension between national security concerns and human rights. While Rumsfeld emphasizes the importance of preventing future attacks, critics argue that the US is compromising its values by using questionable interrogation techniques and denying prisoners their rights. The article raises important questions about the balance between security and humanity in the context of the war on terror.
