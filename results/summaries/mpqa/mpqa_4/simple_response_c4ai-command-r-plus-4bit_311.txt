SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld addressed the controversy surrounding the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism and concerns about potential human rights abuses. Rumsfeld defended the US conduct, stating that the prisoners were being treated humanely and that the use of restraints and sensory deprivation techniques were necessary for security and did not constitute inhumane treatment. He argued that the prisoners were dangerous and needed to be restrained during transport to prevent harm to American soldiers. The debate centered on whether the detainees should be granted prisoner of war (POW) status under the Geneva Convention, with critics arguing for POW status and the associated protections. Rumsfeld acknowledged that the prisoners were being treated as POWs in practice but had not been officially designated as such due to legal complexities surrounding terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. While some countries joined the criticism, others, including Britain and Spain, supported the US position. The article also mentions the lack of interrogation and legal representation for the prisoners, as well as the concerns raised by Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
