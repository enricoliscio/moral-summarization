SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. However, critics argue that the use of sensory deprivation, shackles, and other psychological control techniques violate Geneva Convention rules and are meant to break the prisoners' spirits. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have spoken out against the US's actions, and several governments have called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners are being transported in restraints for safety reasons and that it would be "stupid" to do otherwise. He also stated that the priority is to extract information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks. The moral framing of the article suggests that the US's actions are questionable and may be violating human rights and international law.
