Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rumsfeld defending the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. So, first, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning Rumsfeld's defense against international criticism. He claims the treatment is humane and dismisses the criticism as hyperbole. There are photos showing prisoners in restraints, which have sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. The Red Cross and Amnesty International are critical, saying the US might be violating the Geneva Convention.

I should note the moral issues here: the use of restraints, sensory deprivation, lack of legal representation, and the detainees' status. The US hasn't designated them as POWs, which is a legal and moral question. Some countries support the US, while others, like the EU and Netherlands, argue for upholding values and POW status.

Rumsfeld's arguments include security needs and the necessity of restraints, but critics argue it's inhumane and against international law. The legal limbo and lack of transparency are also key points.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements, highlighting the moral debate without taking sides. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showing them restrained and masked sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological tactics. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, accused the U.S. of violating the Geneva Convention by making a spectacle of prisoners and denying them legal rights. Some governments, like the EU and Netherlands, argued for granting POW status to detainees, emphasizing the need to uphold values against terrorism. Rumsfeld countered that restraints were necessary for security, though he acknowledged the photos' release was "unfortunate." The legal status of detainees remained unclear, with experts urging the U.S. to clarify their POW designation. The moral and legal debate centered on balancing security needs with humanitarian obligations.  
END OF SUMMARY.
