Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rumsfeld defending U.S. detainee treatment in Cuba. The key points are Rumsfeld's defense, the international criticism, the Geneva Convention concerns, and the differing opinions from various countries and organizations.

First, I should identify the main elements: Rumsfeld's claims of humane treatment, the released photos causing outrage, the use of restraints, and the debate over prisoner of war status. The moral aspect involves the ethical treatment of detainees and adherence to international laws.

I need to ensure the summary includes Rumsfeld's arguments, the criticisms from organizations like the ICRC and Amnesty International, the support from some countries, and the legal implications. Also, the lack of official POW designation and the focus on intelligence gathering are important.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects both the U.S. defense and the international condemnation, highlighting the moral issues involved.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed all prisoners were treated humanely, citing secure video briefings with officials. However, released photos showing prisoners in restraints sparked concerns about sensory deprivation and psychological control. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, accused the U.S. of violating Geneva Convention rules and called for prisoner of war (POW) status. Rumsfeld argued that restraining dangerous prisoners was necessary for safety, not inhumane. Despite his claims, legal experts questioned the lack of official POW designation, leaving detainees in legal limbo. The U.S. prioritized extracting intelligence to prevent future attacks, while some countries, like Britain and Spain, supported the U.S., though others, like the Netherlands, urged adherence to international norms. The debate highlighted tensions between counterterrorism measures and human rights obligations.
