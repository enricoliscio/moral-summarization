SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism and concerns over potential violations of the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld dismissed claims of inhumane treatment and sensory deprivation, stating that the prisoners were restrained for security reasons during transportation. He acknowledged the challenge of determining the legal status of detainees from various countries and terrorist organizations, but emphasized the priority of extracting information to prevent future attacks. Critics, including Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, argued for the prisoners' right to legal representation and against the use of psychological tactics such as sensory deprivation and humiliation. The debate surrounding the treatment of prisoners sparked a global discussion on values and the upholding of norms, with some governments supporting the US while others pushed for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention.
