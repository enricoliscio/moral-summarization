SUMMARY: Frustrated by international criticism, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the United States' treatment of detainees in Cuba, dismissing claims of inhumane conditions and stating that their restraint was necessary to prevent harm to American soldiers. Amid criticism from organizations like Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, Rumsfeld acknowledged the release of photographs depicting restrained prisoners was unfortunate but emphasized the need to maintain "positive control." He also highlighted the absence of interrogation at the facility and the challenge of legally designating detainees from countries and terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, some governments called for the prisoners to be granted POW status under the Geneva Convention, while a federal judge in Los Angeles questioned jurisdiction over the case. The debate surrounding the detainees' status and treatment sparked discussions about values, legal technicalities, and preventing future attacks.
