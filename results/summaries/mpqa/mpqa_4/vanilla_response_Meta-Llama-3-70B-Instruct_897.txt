SUMMARY:

US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. The criticism was sparked by the release of photographs showing prisoners in restraints and masks. Rumsfeld argued that the restraints are necessary for transportation and that the prisoners are being treated similarly to prisoners of war. However, the US has not officially designated them as POWs, leaving them in "legal limbo." International organizations, such as the Red Cross and Amnesty International, have criticized the US for possible violations of the Geneva Convention. Several governments, including the European Union, have called for the prisoners to be granted POW status. Britain and Spain have supported the US position.
