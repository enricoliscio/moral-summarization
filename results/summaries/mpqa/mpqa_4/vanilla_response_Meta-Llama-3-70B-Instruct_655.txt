SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid international criticism. He claimed that the prisoners are being treated humanely and that there is no evidence of mistreatment. The criticism was sparked by the release of photographs showing prisoners in restraints and sensory deprivation. International organizations such as the Red Cross and Amnesty International have accused the US of violating Geneva Convention rules and using psychological control techniques to break the prisoners' spirits. Several governments have also called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status. However, Britain and Spain have supported the US position. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners are being treated similarly to prisoners of war, but the US has not officially designated them as such. He emphasized that the priority is to extract information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks.
