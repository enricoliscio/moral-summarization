Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Rumsfeld defending U.S. detainee treatment in Cuba. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Rumsfeld is responding to international criticism about how prisoners at Guantanamo are being treated. He's denying any inhumane treatment, saying they're being treated humanely. The article mentions photos that showed prisoners restrained, which sparked criticism about psychological tactics and Geneva Convention violations.

I should note the key arguments from both sides. Rumsfeld's defense includes the necessity of restraints for safety, especially for dangerous prisoners. Critics argue that techniques like sensory deprivation are being used to break the prisoners' spirits, which is against international laws.

Also, the legal status of the prisoners is a big point. They're not classified as POWs, which leaves them in legal limbo. Countries like Britain and Spain support the U.S., while others like the Netherlands and the EU are critical, emphasizing the need to uphold values.

I need to include Rumsfeld's points, the criticism from organizations like Amnesty International and the Red Cross, the release of photos, and the debate over POW status. It's important to highlight the moral dilemma between security and human rights.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Rumsfeld's defense, then the criticism, the legal issues, and the international reactions. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure each point is concise but covers the moral framing.

Let me check if I included all main points without going over the word limit. I think I covered Rumsfeld's stance, the criticism, the legal status, and the international divide. That should capture the moral aspects the author emphasized.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, dismissing international criticism as "hyperbole." He claimed prisoners were treated humanely, though photos showing restrained and masked detainees sparked accusations of sensory deprivation and psychological tactics to facilitate interrogations. Critics, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, argued the U.S. may have violated the Geneva Conventions by making a spectacle of prisoners. Some governments, like the Netherlands, urged recognizing detainees as prisoners of war for legal protections, while others, like Britain and Spain, supported the U.S. Rumsfeld emphasized the priority of extracting intelligence to prevent attacks, though no interrogations had occurred. The legal status of detainees remained unclear, with some classified as terrorists not covered by Geneva protections. The debate highlighted a moral dilemma between security and human rights.  
END OF SUMMARY.
