SUMMARY:

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst international outcry over photographs showing prisoners in shackles and masks. Rumsfeld claimed the prisoners were treated humanely and dismissed criticism as "breathless armchair hyperbole." However, critics argued that the US was using sensory deprivation and psychological control techniques to weaken prisoners for interrogation. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International expressed concerns, and several governments called for the prisoners to be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld argued that the prisoners were being treated similarly to POWs, but the US had not officially designated them as such. He prioritized extracting information from the prisoners to prevent future attacks, but officials at Guantanamo said no interrogations had taken place and prisoners did not have lawyers. The moral framing of this issue is one of concern for human rights and the ethical treatment of detainees, with many arguing that the US is violating international norms and values.
