SUMMARY: Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld addressed concerns regarding the treatment of detainees in Cuba, asserting that they are being treated humanely and that the recent outcry is exaggerated. Rumsfeld stated that the use of restraints and sensory deprivation techniques are necessary for the safety of American soldiers and do not constitute inhumane treatment. The controversy arose after the release of photographs depicting prisoners in shackles, with their eyes and mouths covered. International criticism argued that these techniques amounted to psychological control and violated Geneva Convention rules. While some countries supported the U.S., others urged the recognition of the detainees as prisoners of war, granting them legal protections. The debate centers on the balance between security and moral obligations, with Rumsfeld prioritizing information extraction from "committed terrorists" over legal technicalities. The article concludes by highlighting the legal complexities surrounding the detainees' status and the ongoing debate about their rights and treatment.
