SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also highlights abuses in countries allied with the US in the war on terror. Notably, the report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war on terror overshadows concerns about human rights. In exchange for support, the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the coalition, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The report poses a challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a pursuit of US interests over universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The author argues that the US must prioritize human rights in its battle against terror and reconsider its role as the world's policeman, lest it become an accomplice in human rights destruction.
