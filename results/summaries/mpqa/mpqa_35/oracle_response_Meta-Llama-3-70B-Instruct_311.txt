SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance. Notably, the report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's tone is strong, but it proposes no corrective action, prioritizing the war on terror over human rights concerns. This approach has led to a two-sided justice system, where the US turns a blind eye to abuses by its allies, including Russia, China, and Israel. The report highlights the naked pursuit of US interests, which undermines the universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The author argues that the US must prioritize human rights to effectively combat terrorism, rather than ignoring abuses within its own alliance. This approach risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
