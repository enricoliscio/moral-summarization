SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked controversy by justifying Israel's human rights abuses as "understandable" due to terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, the report glosses over the US's own post-Sept. 11 restrictions on civil rights and ignores abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition, such as Russia, China, and Israel. This "two-sided justice" approach undermines the universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The report's frank but toothless criticism of human rights abuses is overshadowed by the US's pursuit of its own interests, which is morally problematic. The author argues that the US must promote human rights and democracy, rather than compromising with countries that suppress individual freedom and perpetuate "evil." By doing so, the US risks becoming an accomplice in the destruction of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
