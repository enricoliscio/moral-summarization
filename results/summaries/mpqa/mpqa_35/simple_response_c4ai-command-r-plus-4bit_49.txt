SUMMARY: On March 4, the US State Department's annual human rights report was released, criticizing countries for human rights abuses while notably omitting mention of post-9/11 restrictions in the US itself. The report acknowledges Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a justification for rights abuses, revealing a double standard. While the report is frank, it offers no corrective actions, indicating that the anti-terror alliance and the war on terror take precedence over human rights concerns. The US interpretation of good and evil is challenged by the report, exposing the pursuit of self-interest. The breeding ground for terrorists within the anti-terror alliance, including Russia, China, and Israel, is overlooked. The planned extension of military aid to countries with human rights violations risks making the US complicit. The article questions the legitimacy of the US as a global policeman and suggests reconsidering the role of the UN or adopting a model like the European parliament to better represent international diversity and compromise between countries' interests. The naked pursuit of US interests under the guise of good versus evil lacks understanding and tolerance, hindering the achievement of peace.

END OF SUMMARY.
