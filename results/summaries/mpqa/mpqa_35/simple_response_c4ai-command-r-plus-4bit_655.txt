SUMMARY: A recent US State Department human rights report criticizes countries in the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses while overlooking abuses by members of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report highlights the double standards of US-led anti-terror efforts and prioritizes US interests over universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace. This approach undermines the legitimacy of the US's "good vs. evil" narrative and risks making the US complicit in human rights abuses by providing military aid to countries with poor human rights records. The article argues that the US should instead prioritize universal values and respect for human rights to effectively combat terrorism and promote peace. It suggests that the international community reconsider the role of the UN or look to the European Parliament as a model for balancing the interests of multiple countries in a diverse, globalized world.
