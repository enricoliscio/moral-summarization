Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand its main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes several countries, including those in the anti-terrorist alliance. It mentions that the report downplays human rights abuses by allies like Israel, Russia, China, and others, while focusing on "axis of evil" countries. The author is critical of the US's approach, suggesting that it's more about pursuing their own interests than upholding human rights. There's a moral judgment here about the US's priorities and the hypocrisy in their stance.

I need to identify the morally framed words first. Let me go through the article again. Words like "abusing," "counter-terrorism measures," "restrictions," "curbing," "ignoring," "suppression," "anti-terrorist alliance," "universal values," "realist political science," "legitimacy," "demonizing," "peace," "terrorism," "human rights," "compromising," "interests," "hypocrisy," "universal values," "pursuit," "justice," "evil," "good," "orthodoxy," "unorthodoxy," "supporters," "important ammunition," "military aid," "destruction," "policeman," "compromising," "international diversity," and "reconsider" stand out as morally charged.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. The summary should highlight the US's criticism of certain countries while ignoring allies, the hypocrisy in their human rights stance, the pursuit of self-interest over universal values, and the call for a more balanced international approach. I should ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and maintains the original moral framing.

I'll start by mentioning the report's release, its criticism of some countries but leniency towards allies. Then, point out the hypocrisy and the shift in focus post-9/11. Highlight the US's actions as self-serving, the impact on human rights, and the call for a more inclusive international approach. Make sure to include terms like "abusing," "counter-terrorism measures," "hypocrisy," "universal values," "anti-terrorist alliance," "compromising," and "international diversity."

I should also note the author's suggestion that the US's approach risks being an accomplice in human rights destruction and the need for the international community to reconsider the UN's role. This ties back to the moral framing of justice and collective responsibility.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, ensuring each key point is covered without losing the moral perspective. I'll make sure to use the identified morally framed words to maintain the original tone and message.

**SUMMARY:**  
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea for human rights abuses while overlooking similar violations by anti-terrorist alliance members such as Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's actions against terrorism but ignores US restrictions on civil liberties post-9/11. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows human rights concerns, with the US tacitly accepting allies' abuses in exchange for support. The report highlights the US's pursuit of self-interest, framing its actions as a battle between good and evil, but this narrative lacks depth and understanding. The author argues that human rights are crucial in combating terrorism, but the US's failure to uphold these values within its alliance risks becoming complicit in human rights destruction. The article calls for a more balanced international approach, emphasizing the need for the UN and other bodies to prioritize collective values over unilateral interests. END OF SUMMARY.
