Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report. It mentions that the report criticizes countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, but also includes some allies in the anti-terrorism coalition. The focus is on Israel, where the report justifies their human rights abuses because of their counter-terrorism measures against terrorist attacks. Interesting, so the US is kind of excusing Israel's actions because of the threat they face.

The article also points out that the US doesn't mention its own post-9/11 policies that restricted civil liberties, like travel and immigration controls, or measures affecting accused persons. The report is strong in its wording but doesn't suggest any corrective actions. It seems like the priority is on maintaining the anti-terrorism alliance rather than addressing human rights concerns.

The author criticizes the US for not promoting universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace. They argue that the US is more focused on its interests, using the "good vs. evil" narrative to justify its actions. This is seen as a realist approach in politics, where the US's interests are presented as just, but it's really about power.

The article also mentions that countries with poor human rights records, like Russia, China, and Israel, are being overlooked because they're part of the anti-terrorism alliance. This is a problem because it sets a double standard. The US is supposed to be the world's policeman but isn't holding itself or its allies accountable.

The author suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN and perhaps look into models like the European Parliament, which can better handle the complexities of international diversity. The conclusion is that compromising between different countries' interests is better than letting one country dominate.

So, the moral framing here is about the US's hypocrisy in promoting human rights while ignoring abuses by its allies and not addressing its own policies. It's a critique of realpolitik over universal values, highlighting the double standards and the consequences for global peace and justice.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I should mention the report, the countries criticized, the lack of corrective actions, the US's focus on the anti-terrorism alliance, the hypocrisy in ignoring allies' abuses, the critique of the "good vs. evil" narrative, and the call for a more balanced international approach.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the report's release, mention the criticism of both enemies and allies, highlight Israel's case, note the absence of US self-criticism, discuss the prioritization of the alliance over human rights, critique the US's approach as hypocritical, and conclude with the call for a more equitable international system.

I should ensure that the moral perspective is clear, emphasizing the ethical issues with the US's handling of human rights in the context of the anti-terrorism efforts.

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, while also addressing human rights abuses in anti-terrorism alliance members, notably Israel, whose counter-terrorism measures are justified due to terrorist threats. The report, however, overlooks the US's own post-9/11 policies that restricted civil liberties. It lacks corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terrorism alliance over human rights concerns. The author critiques the US for promoting universal values like democracy and human rights while ignoring abuses by allies, such as Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The "good vs. evil" narrative is seen as a hypocritical justification for US interests. The article calls for a more equitable international approach, suggesting the UN and European Parliament models to balance diverse interests, emphasizing that global peace requires addressing human rights within the alliance. The critique highlights the US's double standards and the need for a more just international system. 

SUMMARY: The US State Department's human rights report criticizes both adversarial "axis of evil" nations and anti-terrorism alliance members, notably Israel, whose counter-terrorism measures are justified despite rights abuses. The report overlooks US post-9/11 policies restricting civil liberties and lacks corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terrorism alliance over human rights. The author condemns the US for promoting universal values while ignoring allies' abuses, highlighting a hypocritical "good vs. evil" narrative.
