SUMMARY: On March 4, the US State Department's annual human rights report was released, critiquing various countries for human rights abuses, including some members of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures while neglecting to address post-9/11 restrictions in the US. While the report is frank, it proposes no corrective actions, indicating that the anti-terror alliance and war on terror take precedence over human rights concerns. The US interpretation of good and evil is challenged by the report, exposing the pursuit of self-interest. The report underscores the significance of human rights in countering terrorism, but the breeding ground for terrorists within the alliance is overlooked. Planned military aid to countries with poor human rights records risks implicating the US in human rights violations. The article questions whether the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or emulate the European parliament to better balance diverse interests in the new century. The selective emphasis on certain countries and the compromise of human rights in favor of military interests underscore the self-serving nature of US actions. This article calls for a reevaluation of global governance to prioritize universal values of human rights, democracy, and peace.
