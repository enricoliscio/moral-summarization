SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked controversy by justifying Israel's human rights abuses as a necessary response to terrorism, while ignoring similar abuses by other countries in the anti-terrorist alliance. The report's silence on US restrictions on civil rights and air travel raises questions about the country's commitment to human rights. The author argues that the US is prioritizing its own interests over universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace, and that this approach will not lead to a lasting solution to terrorism. By ignoring abuses within the anti-terrorist alliance, the US is compromising its moral authority and risking becoming an accomplice to human rights destruction. The author suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to promoting human rights and democracy.
