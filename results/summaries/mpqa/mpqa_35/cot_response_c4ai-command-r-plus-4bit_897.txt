SUMMARY:
The US State Department's recent human rights report reveals a concerning moral compromise in the name of the "war on terror." While criticizing the "axis of evil" countries and some anti-terrorist alliance members for human rights abuses, the report justifies Israel's actions due to its suffering from terrorist attacks. Notably, the US's own post-9/11 restrictions and civil rights curbs are omitted from the report. The author argues that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of good vs. evil, lacking understanding and tolerance. The report highlights the link between terrorism and human rights abuses, yet the US risks becoming an accomplice in the destruction of human rights by providing military aid to countries with questionable records. The article calls for a reconsideration of the UN's role or adopting the European Parliament's model to better balance the interests of multiple countries and uphold the universal values of human rights, democracy, and peace. The US's selective morality and self-interest undermine its legitimacy as a global policeman.
