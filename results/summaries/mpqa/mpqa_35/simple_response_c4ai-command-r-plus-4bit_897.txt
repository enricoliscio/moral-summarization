SUMMARY: On March 4, the US State Department's annual human rights report was released, criticizing countries for human rights abuses while also acknowledging Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a justification for any rights violations. The report notably omitted any mention of post-9/11 restrictions in the US. The author argues that the US is compromising its commitment to universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace in its pursuit of anti-terrorist alliances and the war on terror, particularly by ignoring abuses by Russia, China, and Israel. The US risks becoming complicit in human rights violations by providing military aid to countries with questionable human rights records. The article concludes by questioning the legitimacy of the US as a global policeman and suggests that the international community should reconsider the UN's role or emulate the European Parliament to better balance the interests of multiple countries in the pursuit of peace and human rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
