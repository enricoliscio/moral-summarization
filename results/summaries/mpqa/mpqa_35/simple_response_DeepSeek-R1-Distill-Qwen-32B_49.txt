Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the US State Department's human rights report, which criticizes some countries but overlooks others in the anti-terrorist alliance. It mentions that the US is focusing more on consolidating its anti-terror alliance than addressing human rights issues. The report highlights that human rights abuses in countries like Russia, China, and Israel are being ignored because they support the US's war on terror. The author argues that this approach is hypocritical and undermines the promotion of universal values like democracy and human rights. They suggest that the US's actions are driven by self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to human rights, which could lead to more conflicts and set a bad precedent for international cooperation. The conclusion is that the international community should consider alternative approaches, like relying more on the UN or the European Parliament model, to better balance diverse interests and promote peace and human rights effectively.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, ensuring the moral critique is clear. I should highlight the US's selective approach to human rights, the hypocrisy in ignoring allies' abuses, the impact on the promotion of universal values, and the call for a more balanced international approach.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Russia, China, and Israel for human rights abuses but overlooks similar issues within the anti-terrorist alliance, prioritizing alliance consolidation over human rights concerns. The report's focus on combating terrorism over promoting universal values like democracy and human rights is seen as hypocritical, driven by US self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to justice. By ignoring abuses by alliance members, the US risks becoming complicit in human rights violations and undermining its claim to global leadership. The author argues that this approach, which frames the conflict as a battle of good versus evil, lacks understanding and tolerance and risks perpetuating cycles of violence. To effectively combat terrorism, the US must address human rights issues within the alliance and avoid prioritizing its interests over universal values. The international community should consider alternative approaches, such as strengthening the UN or adopting models like the European Parliament, to better balance diverse interests and promote peace and human rights in the new century. END OF SUMMARY.
