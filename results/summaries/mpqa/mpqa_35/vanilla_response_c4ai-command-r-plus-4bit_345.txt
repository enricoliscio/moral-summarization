SUMMARY: In its annual human rights report, the US State Department criticizes countries, including some of its anti-terrorist allies, for human rights abuses while overlooking its own post-9/11 restrictions and measures. The report highlights Israel's counter-terrorism measures as understandable due to terrorist attacks, but the US ignores abuses by other members of the coalition, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The US justifies its actions as a battle between good and evil, but this is simply a pursuit of its own interests, lacking understanding and tolerance. The report acknowledges the link between terrorism and a lack of human rights, but the US risks becoming complicit in human rights abuses by providing military aid to countries with questionable records. The article suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or look to the European parliament as a model for balancing the interests of multiple countries in a diverse world.
