SUMMARY: In its annual human rights report, the US State Department criticizes countries, including some of its anti-terrorist allies, for human rights abuses. While the report acknowledges Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a response to terrorist attacks, it fails to address post-9/11 restrictions in the US. The article argues that the US is overlooking human rights abuses by its allies, such as Russia, China, and Israel, in exchange for support in the war on terror. The author suggests that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of good versus evil, and that this approach lacks understanding and tolerance. The report highlights the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, but the US risks becoming complicit in human rights violations by providing military aid to countries with poor human rights records. The article calls for the international community to reconsider the role of the UN or to emulate the European parliament to better balance the interests of multiple countries.
