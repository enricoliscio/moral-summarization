Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report released on March 4. It mentions that the report criticizes countries like the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses. But interestingly, it also points out that some members of the anti-terrorist alliance, like Israel, Russia, China, and others, are engaging in rights abuses as well.

The report seems to justify Israel's actions because they're dealing with terrorist attacks, making their counter-terrorism measures understandable. However, the US doesn't mention its own post-9/11 restrictions, which might infringe on civil rights. The report is strong in its wording but doesn't suggest any corrective actions. It seems like the focus is more on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance than on human rights.

The article also discusses how the US is ignoring human rights abuses by its allies in exchange for their support in the war on terror. Examples include Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang and with Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The US isn't promoting universal values like democracy and human rights, which is concerning.

The writer points out that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of fighting terrorism, which is a realist approach. They argue that this might not be the best way to achieve peace and that the international community should consider alternative approaches, perhaps through the UN or models like the European Parliament, to balance diverse interests better.

So, to summarize, the key points are: the US report criticizes some allies, justifies others' actions, ignores its own issues, focuses on the anti-terror alliance over human rights, and the critique suggests a need for a more balanced international approach. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include these main ideas.
