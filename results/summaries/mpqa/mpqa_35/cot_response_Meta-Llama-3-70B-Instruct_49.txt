SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also lists abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as "understandable" due to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's "frank" and "strong" language is overshadowed by its lack of proposed "corrective action". The US is prioritizing its "war on terror" over human rights, tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by its allies, such as Russia, China, and Israel. This approach is a "naked pursuit of US interests" and a form of "two-sided justice". The report highlights the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, but the US must not forget the "breeding ground for terrorists" within its own alliance. END OF SUMMARY.
