SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also lists abuses in countries allied with the US in the war on terror. Notably, the report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's silence on US restrictions on civil rights and air travel raises concerns about the US's commitment to human rights. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war on terror overshadows concerns about human rights, effectively allowing the US to ignore abuses by its allies, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The author argues that this approach is a naked pursuit of US interests, compromising the universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The report's findings pose a challenge to the US's interpretation of good and evil, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach that prioritizes human rights and international cooperation.
