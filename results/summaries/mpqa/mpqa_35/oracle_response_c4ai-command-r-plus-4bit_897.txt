SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries, including those in the "axis of evil," for human rights abuses while overlooking abuses by members of the anti-terrorist alliance, particularly Israel. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a response to terrorist attacks, but fails to address post-9/11 restrictions in the US that curb civil liberties. The US's pursuit of its interests in the war on terror overshadows concerns for human rights, with the US tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by Russia, China, and Israel in exchange for support. This reflects a lack of understanding and tolerance, and the demonization of enemies will not lead to peace. The report highlights the importance of human rights in countering terrorism, but the US must also hold its allies accountable for their abuses. Extending military aid to countries with a history of human rights violations risks making the US complicit in those violations. The article questions the legitimacy of the US as a global policeman and suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or look to the European Parliament as a model for compromising between the interests of multiple countries.
END OF SUMMARY.
