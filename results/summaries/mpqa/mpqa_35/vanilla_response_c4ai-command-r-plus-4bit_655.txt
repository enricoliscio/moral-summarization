SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries, including some anti-terrorist allies, for human rights abuses while overlooking similar abuses by Israel and the US post-9/11. The report reflects the US' self-interested pursuit of consolidating the anti-terror alliance and expanding the war on terror at the expense of human rights concerns. The US interpretation of good vs. evil is challenged by the report's acknowledgment that human rights are crucial in combating terrorism. US plans to provide military aid to allies to fight terrorism risk complicity in human rights abuses. The article suggests reconsidering the UN's role or emulating the European Parliament to better represent diverse international interests and uphold universal values.

END OF SUMMARY.
