SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked controversy by justifying Israel's human rights abuses as "understandable" counter-terrorism measures, while ignoring its own restrictions on civil rights. The report's frank language is overshadowed by its lack of corrective action, prioritizing the consolidation of the anti-terrorist alliance over human rights concerns. This "naked pursuit of US interests" has led to a two-sided justice system, where members of the coalition are tacitly allowed to suppress human rights. The report highlights the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, but the US's approach risks making it an accomplice in human rights abuses. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to compromising between different countries' interests, promoting universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace.
