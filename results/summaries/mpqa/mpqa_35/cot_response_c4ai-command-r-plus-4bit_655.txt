SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report highlights abuses in countries labeled as the "axis of evil," while overlooking abuses by members of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a response to terrorist attacks, but fails to address post-9/11 restrictions on civil liberties in the US. The author argues that the US is pursuing its self-interests under the guise of good vs. evil, compromising universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The "war on terror" risks complicity in human rights abuses and undermines legitimacy. To combat terrorism effectively, the US must address the breeding ground for terrorists within its alliance and prioritize human rights, or consider a more diverse and compromising approach through the UN or the European Parliament. The report underscores the importance of human rights in countering terrorism, but the US must practice what it preaches.
