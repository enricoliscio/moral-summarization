SUMMARY: On March 4, the US State Department released its annual human rights report, criticizing countries for human rights abuses, including some members of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures while overlooking post-9/11 restrictions in the US. It reflects a lack of concern for human rights and a pursuit of self-interest in exchange for support in the war on terror. The US interpretation of good vs. evil is challenged by the report, exposing the double standards of the anti-terrorist alliance. The breeding ground for terrorists within the alliance is a concern. Extending military aid to countries with poor human rights records risks making the US complicit in human rights violations. The article questions the US commitment to universal values and suggests reconsidering the UN's role or learning from the European Parliament to better suit the international diversity of the new century.
