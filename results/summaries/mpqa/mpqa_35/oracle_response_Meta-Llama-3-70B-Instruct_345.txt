SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring US restrictions on civil rights. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows concerns about human rights, leading to a two-sided justice system where the US tacitly agrees to ignore abuses by its allies. The report highlights the suppression of resistance in Chechnya, independence advocates in Xinjiang, and the treatment of Palestinians in Israel. The US's pursuit of its own interests is naked and lacks legitimacy, as it fails to promote universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The report suggests that the US must address human rights abuses within its own alliance to effectively combat terrorism, rather than ignoring them and risking destruction of human rights. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to compromising between different countries' interests.
