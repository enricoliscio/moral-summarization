SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance. Notably, the report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's tone is strong, but it proposes no corrective action, suggesting that the US is prioritizing its war on terror over human rights concerns. The report highlights the suppression of human rights in countries like Russia, China, and Israel, which are part of the anti-terror coalition. The author argues that the US is pursuing its own interests, rather than promoting universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The report's findings challenge the US's simplistic "good vs. evil" narrative and raise questions about the country's role as a global policeman.
