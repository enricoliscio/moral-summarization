Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to summarize the article while preserving those moral terms. 

First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about the US State Department's human rights report, which criticizes certain countries but overlooks human rights abuses in key anti-terrorism allies like Israel, Russia, and China. The author is critical of the US's approach, highlighting that their focus on the war on terror is overshadowing human rights concerns.

Next, I should identify the key morally charged words from the list provided. Words like "abusing," "attacks," "suppression," "destruction," and "compromising" are crucial here. I need to ensure these terms are included in the summary to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by outlining the main sections: the report's content, the US's selective criticism, the impact on human rights, and the broader implications for international cooperation. I'll make sure each section incorporates the moral terms.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. That means being precise and avoiding unnecessary details. I'll focus on the most impactful points, such as the US's tacit agreement to ignore allies' abuses and the potential consequences for global human rights.

Finally, I'll conclude by touching on the need for international cooperation and the role of organizations like the UN, emphasizing the moral imperative to balance interests with universal values.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the report's release, moving through the critique, and ending with the call for a more balanced international approach. I'll ensure that each sentence uses the moral terms effectively to convey the author's stance.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Israel, Russia, and China for abusing human rights, but overlooks similar abuses by its anti-terrorism allies. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures due to terrorist attacks, while ignoring post-Sept. 11 restrictions in the US that curb civil rights. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows human rights concerns, with the US tacitly ignoring abuses by its allies, such as Russia's suppression in Chechnya and China's treatment of Uighurs and Falun Gong. The report lacks corrective action, reflecting the US's pursuit of interests under the guise of justice. The author argues that demonizing enemies and neglecting human rights within the alliance risks breeding terrorism and undermining universal values. The US's plan to extend military aid to allies risks becoming complicit in human rights destruction. The international community should reconsider the UN's role and adopt a more compromising approach, balancing diverse interests rather than succumbing to US unilateralism. END OF SUMMARY.
