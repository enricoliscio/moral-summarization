SUMMARY: The US State Department's recent human rights report criticizes countries for abusing human rights, but its selective application and lack of corrective action reveal a double standard. While the report acknowledges Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a justification for rights abuses, it fails to address post-9/11 restrictions in the US that curb civil liberties. The US-led anti-terrorist alliance, driven by self-interest and a simplistic "good vs. evil" narrative, is willing to ignore human rights abuses by its members, including Russia, China, and Israel. This approach undermines the universality of human rights, democracy, and peace. The report acknowledges the link between human rights abuses and terrorism, yet the US risks becoming complicit in the destruction of human rights by providing military aid to countries with questionable records. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN or emulate the European Parliament to balance the interests of multiple countries and promote universal values. The pursuit of US interests above all reflects a lack of understanding and tolerance, and demonizing enemies will not lead to lasting peace.

END OF SUMMARY.
