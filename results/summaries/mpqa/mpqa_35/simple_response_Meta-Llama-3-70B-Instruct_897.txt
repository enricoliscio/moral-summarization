SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked controversy by downplaying abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a necessary response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The author argues that this double standard undermines the US's claim to promote democracy, human rights, and peace. Instead, the report reveals a naked pursuit of US interests, where countries that support the war on terror are given a free pass on human rights abuses. The author warns that this approach will not lead to peace, as it ignores the breeding ground for terrorists within the anti-terrorist alliance. The US's willingness to extend military aid to these countries risks making it an accomplice in human rights destruction. The author suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to promoting universal values.
