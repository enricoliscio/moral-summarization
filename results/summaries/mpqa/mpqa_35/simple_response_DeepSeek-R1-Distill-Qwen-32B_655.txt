Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report released on March 4. It mentions that the report criticizes countries in the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses. However, it also points out that some members of the anti-terrorist alliance, like Russia, China, and Israel, are engaging in human rights abuses without facing criticism from the US. The report is described as frank but doesn't suggest any corrective actions.

The main moral argument here is that the US is prioritizing its anti-terrorism efforts over human rights, leading to a double standard. The article questions the US's commitment to universal values like democracy and human rights, suggesting that the focus on terrorism has overshadowed these principles. It also critiques the US for not addressing its own post-9/11 policies that limit civil rights.

The author seems to argue that the US's approach is hypocritical and self-serving, ignoring human rights issues in its allies while criticizing others. They suggest that this could lead to a lack of peace and that the international community should reconsider relying on the US and instead look to organizations like the UN or the European Parliament for a more balanced approach.

I need to capture all these points in a concise summary, highlighting the moral issues and the critique of the US's stance on human rights in the context of the anti-terrorism alliance.

The article questions the US's commitment to universal values, suggesting its focus on terrorism has overshadowed human rights. It argues that the US's pursuit of interests under the guise of good versus evil lacks understanding and tolerance, potentially breeding terrorism.
