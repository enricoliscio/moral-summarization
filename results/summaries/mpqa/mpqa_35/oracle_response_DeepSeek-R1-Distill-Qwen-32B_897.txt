Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report and its implications on the anti-terrorist alliance. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The report criticizes human rights abuses in some countries, including Israel, but downplays issues in others that are part of the anti-terror coalition. It mentions that the US is focusing more on consolidating its anti-terror alliance than addressing human rights issues. The author is critical of this approach, arguing that it's more about US interests than justice.

I need to highlight the moral terms like "abusing," "abuses," "suffers," "attacks," "curbing," "ignore," "suppression," "treatment," "pursuit," "destruction," etc. I should structure the summary to show how the US is overlooking human rights in exchange for support against terrorism, leading to the destruction of human rights in some regions.

I'll start by mentioning the report's release and its focus on certain countries. Then, I'll note the downplay of US domestic measures. The article criticizes the US for prioritizing the alliance over human rights, citing examples like Russia, China, and Israel. I'll include the moral judgment that this reflects a pursuit of US interests rather than justice.

Finally, I'll mention the author's suggestion for the international community to reconsider the UN's role, emphasizing compromise over single-country interests. I'll make sure the summary stays within 200 words and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes human rights abuses in "axis of evil" countries and some anti-terrorist alliance members, notably Israel, while downplaying post-Sept. 11 measures curbing civil rights in the US. The report, though frank, proposes no corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terror alliance over human rights concerns. The US tacitly ignores abuses by alliance members, such as Russia's suppression in Chechnya, China's repression in Xinjiang and against Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The report highlights the US's pursuit of interests, framing its actions as a battle of good versus evil, but this reflects a lack of understanding and tolerance. The author argues that human rights are crucial in combating terrorism, yet the US risks becoming complicit in human rights destruction by extending military aid to alliance countries. The report challenges the US's interpretation of justice, suggesting that compromising between diverse international interests, rather than succumbing to US dominance, is better suited for the new century. END OF SUMMARY.
