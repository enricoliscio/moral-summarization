SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries, including allies, for human rights abuses while overlooking its own post-9/11 restrictions. The report highlights Israel's counter-terrorism measures as justifiable due to terrorist attacks, while ignoring abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The US's pursuit of its interests overshadows concerns for human rights and promotes a double standard of justice within the anti-terror alliance. The report acknowledges the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, but the US's actions risk making it complicit in human rights violations. The author suggests that the international community reconsider the UN's role or emulate the European Parliament to better balance the interests of multiple countries and promote universal values.
