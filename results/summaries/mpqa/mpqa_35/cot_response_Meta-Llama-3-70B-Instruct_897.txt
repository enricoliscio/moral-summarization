SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as "understandable" due to terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, the US ignores abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition, such as Russia's suppression in Chechnya and China's suppression of independence advocates. The report poses a challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a "naked pursuit of US interests" that compromises universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The author argues that the US must not forget the "breeding ground for terrorists" within the anti-terrorist alliance and instead prioritize human rights to effectively combat terrorism.
