SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar abuses in the US. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war on terror overshadows concerns about human rights. In exchange for support, the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the coalition, such as Russia's suppression of resistance in Chechnya and China's suppression of independence advocates. The report poses a challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a naked pursuit of US interests. The US must not forget that human rights abuses within the anti-terrorist alliance can breed terrorism. Instead of extending military aid to these countries, the US should prioritize human rights, democracy, and peace. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to compromising between different countries' interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
