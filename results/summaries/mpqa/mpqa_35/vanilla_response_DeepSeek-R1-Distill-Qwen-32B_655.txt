Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report released on March 4. It mentions that the report criticizes countries like the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses, but also includes some members of the anti-terrorist alliance. The interesting part is about Israel; the report says that because of terrorist attacks, Israel's counter-terrorism measures are understandable, even if they involve rights abuses. 

Wait, the article also points out that the US didn't discuss its own post-9/11 measures like travel restrictions and civil rights curbs. The report is strong in wording but doesn't suggest any corrective actions. It seems like the focus is more on consolidating the anti-terror alliance than on human rights. The US is ignoring abuses by other alliance members, like Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang and with Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The article argues that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of fighting terrorism, which is a realist approach. It mentions that the US needs to make its interests appear just, but this might not be effective. The report highlights that countries with poor human rights are breeding grounds for terrorism, so the US should promote human rights. However, the US's own actions, like planning to extend military aid, might end up harming human rights instead. The author suggests that the international community should reconsider the UN's role or follow the European Parliament's approach for a more balanced solution.

So, to summarize, the key points are: the US report criticizes some allies and ignores its own issues, uses the anti-terror alliance to justify overlooking human rights abuses, and the article critiques this as a realist approach that may undermine human rights promotion. It also suggests that international cooperation should be more inclusive.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main points: the report's content, the US's approach, the critique of realpolitik, and the call for international solutions. Make sure to mention the countries involved and the implications of the US's strategy.

The US State Department's annual human rights report, released on March 4, criticized several countries, including members of the anti-terrorist alliance, for human rights abuses. Notably, it justified Israel's counter-terrorism measures, despite potential rights violations, while omitting mention of its own post-9/11 restrictions. The report, though strong in tone, proposed no corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terror alliance over human rights concerns. The US has tacitly overlooked abuses by alliance members, such as Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang and with Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The article critiques this as a realist approach, where US interests are framed as just, potentially undermining human rights promotion. It highlights that poor human rights conditions can breed terrorism, urging the US to address these issues. However, plans to extend military aid risk exacerbating human rights abuses. The author suggests the international community should seek a more inclusive approach, possibly through the UN or the European Parliament model, to balance diverse interests and promote universal values.
