Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all the single words that are morally framed, and then writing a summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "abusing," "criticizing," "understandable," "restrictions," "curbing," "ignored," "ignorance," "suppression," "oppression," "injustice," "legitimacy," "justice," "evil," "good," "orthodoxy," "unorthodoxy," "demons," "peace," "ammunition," "battle," "terrorism," "destruction," "universal," "values," "compromising," "diversity," and "policeman." Each of these words carries a moral judgment or implication, so they're important to highlight.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include these morally framed words. The article discusses the US State Department's human rights report, which criticizes some countries but overlooks others in the anti-terrorist alliance. It mentions how the US is focusing more on consolidating its alliance than on human rights, which is a moral failing. The report highlights that human rights abuses can fuel terrorism, so the US should address them, but it's failing to do so, making it complicit. The author suggests the international community should look to the UN or European Parliament for a better approach.

I need to structure this summary to include the key points and the moral words. I'll start by mentioning the report's release and its selective criticism. Then, I'll note the US's focus on the alliance over human rights, the hypocrisy in ignoring abuses, and the potential consequences. Finally, I'll conclude with the suggestion for a more collective international approach.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, includes all the main points, and retains the moral framing without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft that now.

**SUMMARY:**

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Russia, China, and Israel for rights abuses but overlooks similar issues within its anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures while ignoring US post-Sept. 11 restrictions on civil liberties. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows human rights concerns, with the US tacitly ignoring abuses by its allies. The report highlights the link between human rights abuses and terrorism, urging the US to address these issues to combat terrorism effectively. However, the US's failure to promote universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace raises questions about its legitimacy. The author suggests the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or adopt the European Parliament's approach, emphasizing collective compromise over unilateral interests. The report ultimately reflects the naked pursuit of US interests, wrapped in the guise of justice and morality. END OF SUMMARY.
