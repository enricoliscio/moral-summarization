SUMMARY:
The US State Department's recent human rights report highlights abuses in countries labeled as the "axis of evil," while overlooking those committed by members of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's actions as a response to terrorist attacks and ignores post-9/11 restrictions in the US. The author argues that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of good vs. evil, lacking understanding and tolerance. The report acknowledges that terrorists find support in countries with human rights abuses, yet the US risks becoming an accomplice by providing military aid to countries with poor human rights records. The author suggests that the international community should reconsider the UN's role or emulate the European Parliament to better balance the interests of multiple countries and promote universal values of human rights, democracy, and peace. The article concludes that the US's selective morality undermines its legitimacy in the war on terror and that a more inclusive, global approach is needed for the 21st century.
