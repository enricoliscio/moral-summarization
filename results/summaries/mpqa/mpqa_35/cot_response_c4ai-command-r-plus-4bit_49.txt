SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report highlights abuses in countries labeled as the "axis of evil," while overlooking abuses by members of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report acknowledges Israel's counter-terrorism measures as a response to terrorist attacks, justifying its rights abuses. Notably, the report omits any mention of post-9/11 restrictions in the US that curb civil liberties. While the report is frank, it falls short of proposing corrective actions, indicating that the pursuit of US interests and the consolidation of the anti-terrorist alliance take precedence over human rights concerns. The US interpretation of good vs. evil is challenged by the report's acknowledgment that countries with poor human rights records provide fertile ground for terrorism. President Bush's belief in the supremacy of human rights should prompt him to address the breeding ground for terrorists within the alliance. Extending military aid to countries with questionable human rights records risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights. The article concludes by questioning the US's commitment to universal values and suggests that the international community should reconsider the UN's role or emulate the European Parliament to better balance the interests of multiple countries and promote legitimacy.
