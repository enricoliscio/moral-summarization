Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by understanding the article's main points.

The article discusses the US State Department's human rights report, which criticizes several countries but downplays human rights abuses within the anti-terrorist alliance. It highlights how the US is ignoring its allies' actions, like Russia, China, and Israel, in exchange for their support in the war on terror. The report is seen as a tool to justify US interests rather than promote human rights.

I should focus on the moral terms like "abusing," "attacks," "suppression," and "destruction." I need to ensure the summary reflects the critique of the US's approach and the ethical implications. I'll structure the summary to first mention the report's release, then the criticism of allies, the lack of corrective action, and the broader implications for human rights and the UN's role.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start with the report's release, move to the criticism, then the US's stance, and conclude with the call for a more balanced international approach.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries for abuses, including members of the anti-terrorist alliance, while downplaying its own post-Sept. 11 measures curbing civil rights. Israel's counter-terrorism actions are deemed understandable due to terrorist attacks, but the report ignores abuses by Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows human rights concerns, with the US tacitly ignoring allies' abuses in exchange for support. The report reflects a pursuit of US interests, framed as a battle between good and evil, but lacks corrective action. It highlights the importance of human rights in combating terrorism but risks becoming complicit in their destruction. The author questions the US's legitimacy as a global leader and suggests the international community should reconsider the UN's role, advocating for compromise over single-country dominance. The report ultimately reveals the naked pursuit of US interests, compromising universal values of human rights, democracy, and peace. END OF SUMMARY.
