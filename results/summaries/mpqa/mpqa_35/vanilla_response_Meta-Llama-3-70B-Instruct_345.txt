SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for human rights abuses, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses due to terrorist attacks, while ignoring US restrictions on civil rights. The report proposes no corrective action, prioritizing the war on terror over human rights concerns. The US is tacitly ignoring abuses by other anti-terror coalition members, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The report challenges the US interpretation of good and evil, exposing the naked pursuit of US interests. To genuinely combat terrorism, the US must promote human rights and democracy, rather than compromising with countries that suppress individual freedom. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to balancing diverse country interests.
