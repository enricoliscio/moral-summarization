Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But it also mentions that some countries in the anti-terrorism alliance, like Russia, China, and Israel, are accused of human rights abuses. The report seems to excuse Israel's actions because of their counter-terrorism efforts, but it doesn't address the US's own post-9/11 restrictions.

The author points out that the US is focusing more on building its anti-terrorism alliance than on promoting human rights. They mention that the US is ignoring human rights issues in exchange for support in the war on terror. Examples include Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The article also criticizes the US for not promoting universal values like democracy and human rights. It questions the US's approach to justifying its interests as a battle between good and evil, suggesting this lacks understanding and tolerance. The author warns that this could hinder peace and lead to the US being complicit in human rights violations.

Finally, the article suggests that the international community should look into the UN or the European Parliament's approach for a more balanced solution, emphasizing the importance of respecting human rights in the fight against terrorism.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, keeping the moral perspective intact. I should highlight the US's selective criticism, the impact on human rights, the moral justification issues, and the call for a more international approach.

Let me structure this into a summary that flows logically, ensuring each key point is covered without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea for human rights abuses while also highlighting violations within the anti-terrorism alliance, including Russia's actions in Chechnya, China's treatment of Uyghurs and Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The report excuses Israel's counter-terrorism measures but fails to address US post-9/11 restrictions. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorism alliance overshadows human rights concerns, with the US tacitly ignoring abuses by alliance members in exchange for support. The author argues that the US's framing of the war on terror as a battle between good and evil lacks understanding and tolerance, risking complicity in human rights violations. The article emphasizes the importance of respecting human rights to combat terrorism effectively and suggests the international community should reconsider the UN's role or adopt a more collaborative approach, akin to the European Parliament, to balance diverse interests and promote universal values. END OF SUMMARY.
