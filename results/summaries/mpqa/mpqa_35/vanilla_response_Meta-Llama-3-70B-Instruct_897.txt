SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, but fails to propose corrective action. The report's focus on the "axis of evil" and the war on terror overshadows concerns about human rights, and the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by its allies. The report highlights the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, but the US's pursuit of its own interests risks undermining human rights. The author argues that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from the European parliament's approach to balancing diverse country interests.
