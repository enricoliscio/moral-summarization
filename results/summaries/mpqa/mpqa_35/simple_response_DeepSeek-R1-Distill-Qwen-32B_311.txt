Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes some countries but not its allies, especially in the anti-terrorist alliance. The author seems critical of the US's approach, pointing out that it's ignoring human rights abuses in its allies like Israel, Russia, and China. 

First, I'll identify the main points: the report's focus on certain countries, the lack of discussion on US domestic restrictions, the justification for Israel's actions, and the broader implications of the US's realpolitik. The author is highlighting the moral inconsistency and the prioritization of US interests over human rights.

I need to make sure the summary captures the criticism of the US's double standards and the moral implications. Also, the author suggests that the international community should reconsider relying solely on the US and perhaps look to other models like the UN or European Parliament for a more balanced approach.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the report's release, its selective criticism, the justification for Israel, the absence of US domestic issues, and the underlying realpolitik. Then, I'll touch on the author's critique of the US's moral stance and the suggestion for a more inclusive international approach.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically, highlighting the moral framing as the author intended.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticized "axis of evil" countries and some anti-terrorist alliance members for rights abuses, notably Israel, whose counter-terrorism measures were deemed understandable due to terrorist threats. However, the report avoided discussing post-Sept. 11 US restrictions on civil liberties and proposed no corrective actions. The focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadowed human rights concerns, with the US tacitly ignoring abuses by allies like Russia, China, and Israel. The report highlights the US's pursuit of interests under the guise of moral righteousness, with terrorism used to justify realpolitik. The author criticizes the US for failing to promote universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace, instead prioritizing its own interests. The report suggests that human rights are crucial in combating terrorism, yet the US's selective approach risks complicity in rights violations. The author questions the international community's reliance on the US as the "world's policeman" and advocates for a more inclusive, multilateral approach, akin to the UN or European Parliament, to address global diversity and prevent the erosion of human rights.  
END OF SUMMARY.
