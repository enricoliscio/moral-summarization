SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for human rights abuses, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, and ignores US restrictions on civil rights and air travel. The report proposes no corrective action, prioritizing the war on terror over human rights concerns. The US is tacitly ignoring abuses by other anti-terror coalition members, such as Russia, China, and Israel. The report challenges the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a pursuit of US interests over universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The author argues that the US must prioritize human rights to effectively combat terrorism, and that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or learn from the European parliament's approach to balance diverse country interests.
