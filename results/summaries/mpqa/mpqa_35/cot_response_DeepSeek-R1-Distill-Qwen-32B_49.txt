Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "abuse," "criticizing," "counter-terrorism," "restrictions," "ignoring," "suppression," "injustice," "legitimacy," "democracy," "peace," "evil," "good," "orthodoxy," "unorthodoxy," "compromise," "diversity," "just," and "universal values" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The summary should include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll focus on the main points: the US State Department's report, its criticism of certain countries, the oversight of US measures, the focus on the anti-terror alliance, the moral implications, and the call for a more balanced international approach.

I should ensure the summary is under 200 words and captures the essence of the article, highlighting the moral issues discussed. I'll structure it to mention the report's content, the US's approach, the moral implications, and the suggestion for international cooperation.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include the key moral terms and the main arguments without going into too much detail. I'll keep it clear and to the point, ensuring it reflects the original article's moral framing.

### SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Israel, Russia, and China for human rights abuses, while overlooking its own post-Sept. 11 measures that curtail civil liberties. The report emphasizes the need to combat terrorism but fails to propose corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terrorist alliance over human rights. The US's approach, which frames the conflict as "good vs. evil," risks justifying human rights violations by its allies, such as Israel's treatment of Palestinians, Russia's actions in Chechnya, and China's suppression of dissent. The report highlights the moral hypocrisy of using human rights as ammunition in the fight against terrorism while ignoring the breeding grounds for extremism within the anti-terror coalition. The article questions whether the US, as the "world's policeman," can promote universal values like democracy and peace while pursuing its interests. It suggests that the international community should reconsider the role of the UN and adopt a more balanced, collaborative approach to address global diversity and moral complexities. END OF SUMMARY.
