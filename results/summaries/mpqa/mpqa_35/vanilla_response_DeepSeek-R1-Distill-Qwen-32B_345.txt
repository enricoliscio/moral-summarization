Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report released on March 4. It mentions that the report criticizes countries like the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses. But it also points out that some countries in the anti-terrorism alliance are accused of similar issues. 

The section on Israel is highlighted because, while it's dealing with terrorist attacks, the report justifies its counter-terrorism measures. However, the US doesn't discuss its own post-9/11 restrictions on travel and civil rights. The report is strong in wording but doesn't suggest any corrective actions. 

The main idea seems to be that the US is focusing more on consolidating its anti-terrorism alliance rather than addressing human rights concerns. They're ignoring abuses by their allies, like Russia, China, and Israel. The article also criticizes the US for not promoting universal values like democracy and human rights. 

It mentions that the US is now targeting "rogue nations" and using a two-sided justice approach, where you're either with them or against them. The human rights report challenges this view, suggesting that the US is pursuing its interests under the guise of justice. 

The article also points out that terrorism thrives in countries where human rights are neglected, so the US should address this. However, if they continue to ignore their allies' abuses, they risk undermining their own stance on human rights. The conclusion suggests that the international community should reconsider the UN's role and promote a more collaborative approach rather than letting one country dominate.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the report's criticism, the US's focus on the anti-terrorism alliance over human rights, the examples of allies' abuses, the lack of corrective actions, and the critique of US policy. I should make sure to mention the implications for the US's credibility and the suggestion for a more international approach.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the report's release, its criticism of certain countries, the mention of allies' abuses, the US's own policies not being discussed, the lack of corrective actions, the focus on the alliance over human rights, examples of allies' actions, the critique of US interests over justice, the importance of human rights in combating terrorism, the US's plan to aid allies which might harm human rights, and the suggestion for a more international approach.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine these points without getting too detailed. Make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the report's content, moving to the critique of US policy, and ending with the implications and suggestions.

The US State Department's annual human rights report, released on March 4, criticized countries like those in the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses while also highlighting issues within the anti-terrorism alliance. The report justified Israel's counter-terrorism measures but overlooked the US's own post-9/11 policies affecting civil liberties. It criticized allies such as Russia, China, and Israel for human rights violations, yet proposed no corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terrorism alliance over human rights concerns. The report challenged the US's framing of the fight against terrorism as a battle of good versus evil, suggesting that neglecting human rights in allied countries could foster terrorism. Critics argue that the US's focus on its interests risks undermining its promotion of universal values like democracy and peace. The article concludes that the international community should consider a more collaborative approach, such as through the UN, to address human rights and terrorism effectively, rather than relying on a single nation's agenda.
