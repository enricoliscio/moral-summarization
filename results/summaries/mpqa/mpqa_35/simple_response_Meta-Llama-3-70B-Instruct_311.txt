SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report has sparked controversy by downplaying abuses in countries that are part of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's human rights abuses as a necessary response to terrorism, while ignoring similar abuses in the US. This double standard undermines the report's credibility and suggests that the US is willing to overlook human rights violations in exchange for support in its war on terror. The author argues that this approach is morally bankrupt, as it prioritizes US interests over universal values like democracy, human rights, and peace. By ignoring human rights abuses within its own alliance, the US risks perpetuating a cycle of violence and undermining its own claims to be a champion of human rights. The international community should reconsider the role of the UN and learn from more inclusive and diverse institutions like the European parliament.
