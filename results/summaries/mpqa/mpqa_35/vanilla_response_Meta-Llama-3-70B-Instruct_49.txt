SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance, including Israel, Russia, and China. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring US restrictions on civil rights and air travel. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance overshadows concerns about human rights, with the US tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by its allies. The report poses a challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a pursuit of US interests rather than promoting universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The author argues that the US must prioritize human rights in its battle against terror and reconsider its role as the world's policeman, potentially learning from the European parliament's approach to compromising between different countries' interests.
