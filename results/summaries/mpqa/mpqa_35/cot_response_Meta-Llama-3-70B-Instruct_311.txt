SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as "understandable" due to terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, the US ignores abuses by other alliance members, such as Russia, China, and Israel, in exchange for their support in the war on terror. This "naked pursuit of US interests" undermines universal values of democracy, human rights, and peace. The report highlights the importance of human rights in fighting terrorism, but the US's actions may make it an "accomplice" in human rights destruction. The international community should reconsider the UN's role and learn from the European parliament's approach of compromising between different countries' interests. END OF SUMMARY.
