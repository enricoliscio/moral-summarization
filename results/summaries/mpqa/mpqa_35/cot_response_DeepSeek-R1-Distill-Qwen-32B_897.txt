Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should break down the user's instructions. They provided a news article and specific steps. Step 1 is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "abusing," "criticizing," "suppression," "oppression," etc., come to mind. I'll list each of these with an asterisk and on new lines.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words or less. I need to make sure that the moral framing is preserved, so I should include the identified words where appropriate. The summary should reflect the main points: the US State Department's report, the focus on certain countries, the criticism of the US's handling of human rights, and the implications for the anti-terrorist alliance. I should also touch on the author's argument about the US's realist approach and the need for a more balanced international approach.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll start by mentioning the report's release and its contents, then move on to the criticisms, the impact on the anti-terrorist alliance, and the author's suggestions for the international community.

I should also check that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll keep each sentence concise and focused on the key moral points. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens, making sure the formatting is correct as per the user's instructions.

Overall, the key is to balance between summarizing the article accurately and highlighting the moral aspects as the author presented them. I need to make sure that the summary is both informative and retains the critical tone regarding the US's approach to human rights in the context of the anti-terrorism efforts.

**SUMMARY:**  

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries like Russia, China, and Israel for human rights abuses, while overlooking its own post-Sept. 11 measures that curtail civil liberties. The report frames counter-terrorism efforts as justifying rights abuses, particularly in Israel, but fails to propose corrective actions. The US's focus on consolidating its anti-terrorist alliance has overshadowed concerns about human rights, with the US tacitly ignoring abuses by its allies. The report highlights the naked pursuit of US interests, using the rhetoric of good versus evil to legitimize its actions. However, the author argues that this approach risks making the US an accomplice in human rights violations. The article questions whether the international community should reconsider the role of the UN or adopt a more balanced approach, emphasizing the importance of respecting human rights to combat terrorism effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
