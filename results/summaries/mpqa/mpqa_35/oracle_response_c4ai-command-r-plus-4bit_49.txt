SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries for abusing human rights, including members of the anti-terrorist alliance. While the report acknowledges Israel's counter-terrorism measures as understandable, it fails to address post-9/11 restrictions in the US. The report exposes the US's pursuit of self-interest in the war on terror, compromising its legitimacy. By ignoring human rights abuses within the alliance, the US risks becoming an accomplice in the destruction of human rights. With its claims of upholding democracy, human rights, and peace, the US should reflect on its actions. The article suggests reconsidering the UN's role or learning from the European Parliament to balance diverse international interests in the new century. The selective criticism and lack of proposed corrective action in the report highlight a double standard in the US's interpretation of good and evil.
