SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, but also lists abuses in countries part of the anti-terrorist alliance. The report justifies Israel's rights abuses as a response to terrorist attacks, while ignoring similar issues in the US. The report's focus on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war on terror overshadows concerns about human rights. In exchange for support, the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the coalition, such as Russia's suppression of resistance in Chechnya and China's suppression of independence advocates. The report poses a challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil, revealing a naked pursuit of US interests. The US must not forget that human rights abuses within the anti-terrorist alliance can breed terrorists. The report's lack of corrective action and the US's willingness to extend military aid to countries with poor human rights records may lead to further destruction of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
