SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report criticizes countries, including some members of the anti-terrorist alliance, for abuses. Notably, the report justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures despite human rights violations. Post-9/11 restrictions in the US are not addressed. The report reflects a shift in US priorities towards consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war on terror, compromising concerns for human rights. The US turns a blind eye to abuses by allies like Russia, China, and Israel. The author argues that the US interpretation of good vs. evil is self-serving and fails to promote universal values. The report underscores the link between human rights abuses and terrorism, but the US risks becoming complicit in human rights violations by providing military aid to allies with questionable records. The article suggests reconsidering the UN's role or emulating the European Parliament to better balance diverse international interests. 

END OF SUMMARY.
