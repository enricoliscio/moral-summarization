Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report, which criticizes countries like those in the "axis of evil" for human rights abuses. It also mentions that the report includes some members of the anti-terrorist alliance. The focus is on Israel, which is justified in taking counter-terrorism measures because of terrorist attacks. However, the report doesn't discuss US measures post-9/11, like restrictions on travel and civil rights. The report is strong in wording but doesn't propose any corrective actions. The priority is on consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance, overshadowing human rights concerns.

The author points out that the US is ignoring human rights abuses by its allies, such as Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang and with Falun Gong, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The US's own actions don't promote universal values like democracy and human rights. The report challenges the US's view of good versus evil, suggesting it's just about US interests. The author argues that promoting human rights is important for fighting terrorism, but the US's approach risks becoming complicit in human rights destruction. The conclusion suggests the international community should rethink the UN's role and consider a more compromising approach rather than just following US interests.

Now, I need to create a summary using as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "abusing," "abuses," "suffers," "attacks," "measures," "curbing," "discussed," "proposes," "overshadowing," "ignore," "suppression," "treatment," "activities," "become," "pursuit," "reflect," "demonizing," "gained," "respected," "repressed," "attack," "make," "thinking," "destruction," "practicing," "compromising," "succumbing."

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral framing is preserved. I'll mention the report's criticism, the overlooking of US measures, the ignoring of allies' abuses, the pursuit of interests, the reflection on values, and the call for international compromise.

Let me put this together concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

It justifies Israel's counter-terrorism measures due to attacks but ignores post-9/11 US restrictions. The report, though strong, proposes no corrective actions, prioritizing the anti-terrorist alliance over human rights. The US tacitly ignores allies' abuses, such as Russia in Chechnya, China in Xinjiang, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. US activities don't promote universal values, focusing instead on interests, reflecting a lack of understanding. The report challenges the US's good vs. evil narrative, suggesting it's driven by interests. To combat terrorism, human rights must be addressed, but the US risks destruction by aiding allies. The author urges the international community to reconsider the UN's role and adopt a compromising approach, better suited to global diversity.
