Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Shuttle Atlantis launch. The user wants me to focus on preserving the moral framing that the author used. First, I should identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article mentions "successful blastoff," which implies success and achievement. "Flurry of activity" suggests urgency and purpose. "Completion" is a positive goal. "Computer glitch" is a problem, so that's a negative. "Frantically reloaded software" shows urgency and maybe some stress. "Launch delay" is another negative event. "Milestone" is a positive achievement. "First astronaut" highlights an accomplishment. "Space walks" are significant efforts. "Keystone" is crucial, so that's positive. "Solar energy array" is a positive development.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I should structure it to highlight the successful launch, the challenges overcome, and the importance of the mission. I'll start with the launch, mention the delay and the computer glitch, then talk about the mission's milestones and the installation of the key structure. I'll also note the significance of the astronaut's record. I need to make sure the moral framing words are included naturally in the summary.

* glitch
* frantically
* delay
* keystone

**SUMMARY:**
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. The mission, delayed by a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak and a computer glitch, finally took off after engineers frantically reloaded software just in time. Atlantis is carrying seven astronauts and hardware to install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station, a crucial structure supporting a large solar energy array. This launch is part of a flurry of activity to complete the space station. Notably, astronaut Jerry L. Ross achieved the distinction of being the first to make seven space flights. The 11-day mission includes four spacewalks to install the 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "S-Zero" structure. END OF SUMMARY.
