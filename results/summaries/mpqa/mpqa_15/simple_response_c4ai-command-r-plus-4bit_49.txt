SUMMARY: With a truckload of hardware and seven astronauts on board, the space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, marking a significant milestone in U.S. space exploration. Despite a computer glitch that required a last-minute software reload, the launch proceeded smoothly and on time, thanks to the dedicated work of the NASA team led by launch director Mike Leinbach. This mission holds special significance as it marks the seventh space flight for Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather and mission specialist, setting a record in U.S. space exploration. Over the next 11 days, the astronauts will undertake four spacewalks to install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station. Weighing 27,000 pounds and measuring 44 feet in length, the "S-Zero" structure will support a vast solar energy array, showcasing human ingenuity and our unwavering pursuit of knowledge and progress.
