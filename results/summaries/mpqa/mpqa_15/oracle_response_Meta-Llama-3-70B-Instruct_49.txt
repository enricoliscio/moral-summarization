SUMMARY:

In a thrilling milestone for U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis thundered toward the International Space Station on Monday, overcoming a four-day delay and a last-minute computer glitch. The successful blastoff marked the first of six scheduled launches in the next seven months, designed to bring the space station closer to completion. Astronauts and a "truckload of hardware" are now racing toward their destination, with a crucial mission to install the "keystone" center support unit for the space station. This 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure will support a massive new solar energy array, stretching over a football field in length. The launch was a testament to perseverance, with engineers frantically reloading software to overcome the computer glitch, finishing with just 11 seconds to spare. The mission is a remarkable achievement, with mission specialist Jerry L. Ross becoming the first astronaut to make seven space flights, a true milestone in U.S. space flight.
