SUMMARY:
In a milestone mission, Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and critical hardware to the International Space Station. The launch, a moral triumph for NASA, came after a four-day delay due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe. A computer glitch during the countdown further marred the launch, but engineers frantically reloaded software, finishing with mere seconds to spare. The mission, commanded by Mike Bloomfield, marks the first of six launches scheduled over the next seven months, a flurry of activity aimed at completing the space station. Aboard Atlantis is the "S-Zero" structure, a 27,000-pound centerpiece that will support a vast new solar energy array. During four space walks, astronauts will install this "keystone" unit, a crucial step forward in the station's construction. This launch also marks a personal milestone for mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, who becomes the first astronaut to fly seven space flights. END OF SUMMARY.
