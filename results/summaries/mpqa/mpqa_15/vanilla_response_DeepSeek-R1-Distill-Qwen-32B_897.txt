Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shuttle Atlantis. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about the shuttle's successful launch. It mentions that seven astronauts and a lot of hardware are heading towards the International Space Station. The launch was the first of six scheduled over the next seven months, aimed at completing the station.

There's some detail about the engines and the orange fire pillar. Also, there was a computer glitch during the countdown, but they fixed it just in time. The launch was delayed four days because of a leak in the liquid hydrogen vent pipe.

NASA's launch director made a comment to the commander, which seems a bit light-hearted. The mission is a milestone because Jerry Ross is making his seventh flight, which is a first. The main goal is installing a support unit for a new solar array. The structure is 44 feet long and weighs 27,000 pounds, and it's supposed to support a huge solar array.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: the successful launch, the six missions ahead, the delay and computer glitch, the milestone for Jerry Ross, and the main mission objective with the support unit and solar array.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the launch, then the context of the missions, the technical issues, the milestone, and the mission's purpose. I need to make sure it's concise and flows well.

Let me put that together.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched on Monday, carrying seven astronauts and hardware to the International Space Station (ISS). This was the first of six missions over the next seven months aimed at completing the ISS. The launch, delayed four days due to a liquid hydrogen leak, was nearly halted by a computer glitch but resolved just before liftoff. Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield and crew embarked on a mission featuring four spacewalks to install a 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound support structure for a new solar array. Astronaut Jerry Ross, making his seventh flight, became the first to achieve this milestone. The mission marks a significant step toward the ISS's completion. END OF SUMMARY.
