Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the author's tone.

The article talks about the successful launch of the space shuttle Atlantis. It mentions the seven astronauts, the hardware on board, and the destination, the International Space Station. The launch was the first of six in seven months, aimed at completing the space station. There's a description of the engines and the fire pillar, which adds some drama. 

There's a mention of a computer glitch and a software reload just before launch, showing some tension. Also, a four-day delay due to a leak in the vent pipe. The commander gets a light-hearted comment from the launch director. 

Jerry Ross is highlighted as the first astronaut to make seven space flights, emphasizing his dedication and experience. The mission involves installing a crucial support unit, the S-Zero, which is important for future solar arrays. 

Now, looking at the morally framed words the user mentioned: "thundered," "belched," "milestone," "dedication," "frantically," "spared," "extraordinary," "milestone," "dedication," "frantically," "spared," "extraordinary." I need to include these where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to include the successful launch, the mission's importance, the challenges overcome, and the significance of the astronauts' achievements. I'll make sure to use the moral words to convey the effort and dedication involved.

Let me start drafting: The shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, carrying seven astronauts and hardware to the ISS. It was the first of six missions to complete the station. Despite a computer glitch and a four-day delay due to a leak, the launch went smoothly. The engines' fire was dramatic. Commander Bloomfield was told it was time to go after the delay. This mission marks a milestone in space flight, with Ross making his seventh flight. The astronauts will install a key support unit for future solar arrays, highlighting the teamwork and dedication behind the mission.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral framing words. Let me check the word count and adjust as needed. Maybe combine some sentences to keep it tight. Also, ensure that the words like "thundered," "frantically," "milestone," and "dedication" are included naturally.
