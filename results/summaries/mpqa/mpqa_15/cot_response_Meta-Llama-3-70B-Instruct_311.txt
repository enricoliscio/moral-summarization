SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off on Monday, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Despite a four-day delay caused by a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the launch was a triumphant moment, with the astronauts and hardware racing towards the International Space Station. The mission is a significant step towards completing the space station, with the installation of the "keystone" center support unit and a new solar energy array. This achievement is made even more remarkable by mission specialist Jerry L. Ross becoming the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The successful launch is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the NASA team.
