SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and a cargo of hardware for the International Space Station. This launch marked the first of six scheduled missions over the next seven months aimed at completing the space station. The highlight of the mission is the installation of the "S-Zero" structure, a 44-foot-long and 27,000-pound centerpiece that will support a massive new solar energy array. The launch was delayed by four days due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, and a last-minute computer glitch added some suspense. However, the issues were resolved, and the shuttle blasted off without further incident. This mission also marked a milestone for astronaut Jerry L. Ross, who became the first astronaut to fly into space seven times. The 11-day mission includes four spacewalks to complete the installation of the "S-Zero" structure. End of summary.
