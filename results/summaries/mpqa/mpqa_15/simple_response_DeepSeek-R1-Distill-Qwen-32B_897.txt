Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shuttle Atlantis. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, I should first read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

The article starts by talking about the successful launch of Atlantis, which is part of a series of missions to complete the International Space Station. There's mention of a computer glitch and a delay due to a leak, but they managed to fix it just in time. They also highlight Jerry Ross, who became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The mission involves installing a crucial structure for the space station.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points: the launch success, the delays and fixes, the milestone for Ross, and the importance of the mission. The moral framing here seems to be about perseverance and achievement despite challenges. The article emphasizes overcoming obstacles and reaching a significant milestone, so I should reflect that in the summary.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it to first mention the launch, then the challenges, the milestone, and the mission's purpose. That should cover all the important aspects while maintaining the positive and achievement-oriented tone.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and essential hardware toward the International Space Station (ISS). This mission marks the first of six scheduled launches over the next seven months, aimed at advancing the ISS's completion. The launch was delayed by four days due to a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak and a computer glitch, which engineers resolved just 11 seconds before the final countdown. NASA launch director Mike Leinbach greeted the crew with a light-hearted comment as they prepared for liftoff. Atlantis, equipped with three new main engines, thundered into space, carrying the "S-Zero" structureâ€”a critical 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound support unit for the ISS. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four spacewalks to install this keystone structure, which will support a large solar energy array. Notably, astronaut Jerry L. Ross achieved a milestone as the first astronaut to make seven space flights. This mission underscores the resilience and dedication of NASA's efforts to advance space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
