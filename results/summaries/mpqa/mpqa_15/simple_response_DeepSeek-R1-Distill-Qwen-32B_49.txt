Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Shuttle Atlantis launch. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about the successful launch of Atlantis, which is part of a series of six missions to complete the International Space Station. There were some challenges, like a computer glitch and a four-day delay due to a leak. Despite these, the mission went ahead, and it's a milestone with Jerry Ross making his seventh flight. They're installing a crucial support structure for solar arrays.

Now, the moral framing. The article emphasizes overcoming obstacles and teamwork. The delays and glitches didn't stop them; they worked through it. It's about perseverance and the importance of the mission for space exploration. So, in the summary, I should highlight the successful launch despite challenges, the milestone, and the collaborative effort.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention the launch, the challenges faced, the milestone, and the mission's purpose. Make sure to include the technical details like the support unit and its role in the space station.

I should avoid technical jargon but keep it informative. Also, the tone should be positive, reflecting the achievement. Maybe start with the launch, then the challenges, then the milestone, and the mission's significance.

Wait, I should also mention the seven astronauts and the hardware they're carrying. That shows the scale of the mission. And the support unit is crucial for the solar arrays, which is a big step towards completing the ISS.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow from the launch, through the challenges, to the milestone and the mission's purpose, all while highlighting the perseverance and teamwork.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, marking a significant milestone in U.S. space exploration. The mission, delayed four days due to a liquid hydrogen leak and a computer glitch, carried seven astronauts and essential hardware to the International Space Station (ISS). Atlantis, equipped with three new main engines, blasted off at 4:44 p.m., with NASA engineers resolving the computer issue just 11 seconds before liftoff. This launch is the first of six missions aimed at completing the ISS. Notably, astronaut Jerry L. Ross achieved the distinction of being the first to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "S-Zero" support structure, a 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound keystone unit critical for supporting a new solar energy array. This mission underscores the resilience and precision required in space exploration, as the crew overcame challenges to advance the ISS's construction. END OF SUMMARY.
