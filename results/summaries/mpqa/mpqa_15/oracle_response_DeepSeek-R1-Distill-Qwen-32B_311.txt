Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis and a list of morally framed words used by the author. My goal is to summarize the article while preserving those moral elements. 

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, emphasizing values or ethics. In the given list, words like "milestone," "extraordinary," "success," "glitch," "frantic," "extraordinary," "dedication," and "commitment" are used. I should make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the author's moral perspective.

Next, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. The shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, carrying seven astronauts and hardware to the International Space Station. The launch was delayed due to a leak, and there was a computer glitch that required quick action from engineers. Jerry Ross made history as the first astronaut with seven flights. The mission involves installing a crucial structure for the space station.

Now, I'll structure the summary. I should start with the successful launch, mention the milestone, the seven astronauts, and the hardware. I'll include the delay caused by the leak and the computer glitch, using "glitch" and "frantic" to convey the urgency. Then, highlight Jerry Ross's achievement with "extraordinary" and "milestone." Finally, describe the mission's purpose, emphasizing the importance of the structure using "keystone" and "extraordinary."

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the morally framed words. I'll also make sure the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content while maintaining the author's tone and values.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight as it carried seven astronauts and essential hardware toward the International Space Station. The mission, delayed four days due to a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak, was further complicated by a computer glitch that required engineers to frantically reload software, narrowly completing the task with just 11 seconds to spare. Atlantis, equipped with three new main engines, thundered into space, carrying the 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "S-Zero" structure, a keystone component for the space station. Astronaut Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, achieved the extraordinary milestone of becoming the first astronaut to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will perform four spacewalks to install the structure, which will support a massive solar energy array nearly an acre in size. This mission represents a significant step toward completing the space station, showcasing NASA's dedication and commitment to advancing space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
