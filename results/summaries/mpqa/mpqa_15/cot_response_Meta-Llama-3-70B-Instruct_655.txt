**SUMMARY:**

SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off on Monday, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Despite a four-day delay caused by a leaky vent pipe, the launch was a triumphant moment, with astronauts and hardware racing towards the International Space Station. The mission is a crucial step towards completing the space station, with the installation of the "keystone" center support unit and a new solar energy array. This achievement is made even more remarkable by the fact that mission specialist Jerry L. Ross became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The successful launch is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the NASA team. END OF SUMMARY.
