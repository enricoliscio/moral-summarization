SUMMARY:
In a display of perseverance and determination, NASA successfully launched the space shuttle Atlantis with seven astronauts and a substantial hardware payload, marking a significant milestone in U.S. space exploration. Despite a computer glitch that frantically marred the final countdown, engineers acted promptly, reloading software with mere seconds to spare. The launch, a testament to human ingenuity and resilience, followed a brief delay caused by a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak. Atlantis' mission is momentous, as astronaut Jerry L. Ross sets a new record with his seventh space flight. During their 11-day journey, the crew will undertake four spacewalks to install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station. This crucial 27,000-pound structure will support a massive solar energy array, furthering our reach into the cosmos. This launch is a thunderous testament to NASA's unwavering commitment to space exploration and the completion of the International Space Station, setting the stage for future exploration and discovery.
