SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Despite a four-day delay caused by a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the launch was a triumphant moment, with NASA launch director Mike Leinbach telling Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield, "You spent a few extra days in Florida, but it's time to take a ride." The mission is a significant step towards completing the International Space Station, with astronauts set to install the "keystone" center support unit during four space walks. This 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure will support a new solar energy array, stretching over a football field in length. The launch is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the astronauts and engineers involved. END OF SUMMARY.
