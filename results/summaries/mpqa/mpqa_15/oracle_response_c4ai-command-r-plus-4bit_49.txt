SUMMARY: Seven astronauts bravely embarked on a mission to further human exploration of space, carrying a truckload of hardware destined for the International Space Station. Despite a minor computer glitch that was resolved with only seconds to spare, the Atlantis shuttle's launch was a resounding success, thanks to the dedication and expertise of NASA's engineers and launch director Mike Leinbach. This launch was particularly significant as it marked the first of six missions in seven months, a flurry of activity aimed at completing the International Space Station. The Atlantis crew, led by commander Mike Bloomfield, will spend 11 days in space, with mission specialist Jerry L. Ross setting a record as the first astronaut to fly seven space flights. During their mission, they will perform four space walks to install the crucial "S-Zero" structure, a 27,000-pound centerpiece that will support a massive new solar energy array. This courageous and virtuous endeavor advances humanity's noble quest to explore the cosmos and expand our knowledge.
