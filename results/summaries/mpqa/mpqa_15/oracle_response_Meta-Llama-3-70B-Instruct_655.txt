SUMMARY:

In a thrilling milestone for U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis thundered toward the International Space Station on Monday, overcoming a four-day delay caused by a leaky liquid hydrogen vent pipe. Despite a computer glitch that marred the countdown, engineers worked frantically to reload software, finishing the job with just 11 seconds to spare. The successful blastoff marked the first of six scheduled launches over the next seven months, a flurry of activity designed to get the space station closer to completion. Mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, became the first astronaut to make seven space flights, a remarkable achievement. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "keystone" center support unit, a crucial component that will support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size. The launch was a testament to perseverance and determination, with NASA launch director Mike Leinbach urging Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield to "take a ride" after the delay.
