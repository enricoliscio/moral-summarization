SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched with seven astronauts and a cargo of hardware, marking the first of six scheduled launches over the next seven months aimed at completing the International Space Station. The launch was delayed by four days due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, and a last-minute computer glitch caused a frantic software reload just seconds before liftoff. This mission is significant as astronaut Jerry L. Ross becomes the first astronaut to make seven space flights, and the astronauts will install a crucial 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "S-Zero" structure during four spacewalks. The structure will support a massive new solar energy array, marking a key milestone in the construction of the space station. END OF SUMMARY.
