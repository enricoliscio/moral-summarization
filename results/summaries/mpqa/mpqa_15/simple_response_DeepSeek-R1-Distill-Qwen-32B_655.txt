Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shuttle Atlantis launch. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words and includes the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the successful launch of Atlantis, which is part of a series of missions to complete the International Space Station. There were some delays due to a computer glitch and a leak in the liquid hydrogen vent pipe, but they managed to fix it just in time. The mission includes installing a crucial structure for the space station. Also, Jerry Ross made history by being the first astronaut on his seventh flight.

Now, the user mentioned preserving the moral framing. The original text highlights the teamwork, overcoming challenges, and the significance of the mission. So, the summary should reflect these themes: the triumph over obstacles, the importance of the mission, and the milestone in space exploration.

I need to make sure the summary is concise but covers all key points: the launch success, the delays and fixes, the mission's purpose, and Jerry Ross's achievement. I'll structure it to flow from the launch details to the mission's significance, emphasizing the effort and success.

I should also keep it under 200 words. Let me start drafting, making sure to include all these elements without getting too wordy. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and critical hardware to the International Space Station (ISS). This mission marks the first of six scheduled launches over the next seven months, aimed at advancing ISS construction. The launch was delayed due to a computer glitch and a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak, but engineers resolved the issues just in time. Atlantis lifted off with three new main engines, and the mission includes four spacewalks to install a key "keystone" structure for the ISS. This 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound unit will support a large solar array. Additionally, astronaut Jerry L. Ross became the first to achieve seven spaceflights, highlighting the mission's significance in U.S. space exploration. The launch underscored NASA's commitment to overcoming challenges to achieve its ambitious goals. END OF SUMMARY.
