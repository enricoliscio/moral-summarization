SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched with a crew of seven astronauts and a cargo of hardware, marking the first of six planned missions over the next seven months to accelerate the completion of the International Space Station. This launch was delayed by four days due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe. The mission is a significant milestone in U.S. space exploration, with astronaut Jerry L. Ross becoming the first to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four spacewalks to install the "keystone" center support unit, a 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure called "S-Zero," which will support a massive new solar energy array. The launch also featured a last-minute software reload to fix a computer glitch, completed just 11 seconds before liftoff. End of summary.
