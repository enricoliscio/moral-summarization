SUMMARY:

In a thrilling milestone in U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis thundered toward the International Space Station on Monday, overcoming a four-day delay caused by a leaky liquid hydrogen vent pipe. The successful blastoff marked the first of six scheduled launches in the next seven months, aimed at getting the space station closer to completion. Despite a computer glitch that marred the countdown, engineers frantically reloaded software, finishing the job with just 11 seconds to spare. The mission is a testament to perseverance and determination, with Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield being told by NASA launch director Mike Leinbach, "You spent a few extra days in Florida, but it's time to take a ride." The 11-day mission will see astronauts install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station, a crucial step toward supporting a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size.
