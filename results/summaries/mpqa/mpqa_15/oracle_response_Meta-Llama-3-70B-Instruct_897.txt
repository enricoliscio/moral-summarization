SUMMARY:

In a thrilling milestone for U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off on Monday, overcoming a four-day delay and a last-minute computer glitch. The "ride" was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the NASA team, who reloaded software with just 11 seconds to spare. The launch marked a significant step towards completing the International Space Station, with the Atlantis carrying a "truckload" of essential hardware. The mission's seven astronauts, including grandfather and veteran astronaut Jerry L. Ross, who became the first to make seven space flights, will work tirelessly to install the "keystone" center support unit during four space walks. This crucial structure will support a massive new solar energy array, stretching over a football field in length. The successful launch is a testament to the team's perseverance and commitment to advancing space exploration.
