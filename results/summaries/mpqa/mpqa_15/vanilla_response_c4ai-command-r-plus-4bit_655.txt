SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and a load of hardware to the International Space Station. This launch marked a busy period for NASA, with six launches planned in the next seven months to speed up the space station's completion. The mission specialist, Jerry L. Ross, made history as the first astronaut to fly into space seven times. The Atlantis crew will conduct four spacewalks to install the crucial S-Zero structure, which will support a massive new solar energy array for the space station. The launch, though delayed by four days due to technical issues, was a significant milestone in the U.S. space program. Engineers scrambled to fix a computer glitch during the countdown, reloading software just seconds before liftoff. Atlantis' journey underscores NASA's commitment to advancing space exploration and research.
