SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on Monday, carrying seven astronauts and a large payload of hardware towards the International Space Station. Despite a four-day delay due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the launch marked a milestone in U.S. space flight. The mission aims to bring the space station closer to completion, with astronauts set to perform four space walks to install the "keystone" center support unit. This 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure will support a new solar energy array, nearly an acre in size. The launch was also notable for mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, who became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The successful launch demonstrates NASA's perseverance and dedication to advancing space exploration.
