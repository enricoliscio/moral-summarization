SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral on Monday, carrying seven astronauts and a large payload of hardware to the International Space Station. The launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months, aimed at completing the space station. Despite a computer glitch that delayed the countdown, the shuttle lifted off at 4:44 p.m. with just 11 seconds to spare. The mission marks a milestone in U.S. space flight, with astronaut Jerry L. Ross becoming the first to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four space walks to install the "keystone" center support unit for the space station, which will support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size.

END OF SUMMARY.
