SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral on Monday, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Despite a four-day delay due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the launch was a triumph, with the astronauts and hardware racing towards the International Space Station. The mission is a critical step towards completing the space station, with the installation of the "keystone" center support unit and a new solar energy array. The launch was a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the NASA team, who worked tirelessly to overcome the technical glitch. With this successful launch, the team has made the most of their extra time in Florida, and it's now time to take a ride towards the completion of the space station. END OF SUMMARY.
