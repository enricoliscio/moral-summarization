SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and a cargo of hardware to the International Space Station. This mission marks the first of six scheduled launches over the next seven months, aiming to bring the space station closer to completion. A computer glitch caused a delay in the countdown, but engineers managed to fix the issue with just seconds to spare. The launch also marked a milestone for astronaut Jerry L. Ross, who became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The primary objective of the 11-day mission is to install the "S-Zero" structure, which will support a massive new solar energy array. The structure measures 44 feet in length and weighs 27,000 pounds. With Atlantis now racing towards the space station, the crew is set to undertake four spacewalks to complete their mission objectives. End of summary. END OF SUMMARY.
