SUMMARY: Despite a computer glitch and a four-day delay, the successful blastoff of the space shuttle Atlantis with seven astronauts and a cargo of hardware aboard marks a significant milestone in U.S. space exploration. With a new set of powerful engines, Atlantis soared into space, marking the first of six launches planned over the next seven months to accelerate the completion of the International Space Station. The mission, led by commander Mike Bloomfield, is a testament to NASA's dedication and perseverance in the face of challenges. Notably, astronaut Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, achieves the distinction of being the first astronaut to embark on seven space missions. The primary objective of this particular mission is to install the crucial "S-Zero" structure, which will support a vast solar energy array, marking a significant step forward in the expansion of our capabilities in space. This launch demonstrates the determination and skill of NASA professionals and their commitment to advancing space exploration despite obstacles. END OF SUMMARY.
