Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article about the shuttle Atlantis. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, carrying seven astronauts and a lot of hardware towards the International Space Station. The launch was the first of six scheduled over the next seven months, aiming to complete the space station.

There's a mention of three new main engines and a computer glitch that caused a delay. They had to reload software just 11 seconds before launch. Also, there was a four-day delay due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe.

Jerry L. Ross, an astronaut, made history by becoming the first to make seven space flights. The mission includes four space walks to install a critical support unit called the "S-Zero" structure, which is 44 feet long and weighs 27,000 pounds. This structure will support a large solar array.

I should condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include the main events: the launch details, the delays, the milestone for Jerry Ross, and the purpose of the mission.

Let me structure it step by step: mention the launch, the number of astronauts, the purpose, the delays, the milestone, and the mission's main task. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I think that covers all the essential points. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, carrying seven astronauts and a large amount of hardware toward the International Space Station (ISS). This was the first of six planned missions over the next seven months aimed at completing the ISS. The launch, delayed by four days due to a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak and a computer glitch, occurred at 4:44 p.m. Astronaut Jerry L. Ross became the first to achieve seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four spacewalks to install a critical "S-Zero" support structure, weighing 27,000 pounds, to support a new solar array.  
END OF SUMMARY.
