SUMMARY:
The successful blastoff of the space shuttle Atlantis carrying seven astronauts and a truckload of hardware marks a milestone in U.S. space exploration history. Despite a computer glitch during the countdown, engineers frantically reloaded software, launching Atlantis with just seconds to spare. This mission is significant as it is the first of six scheduled launches in the next seven months, aiming to get the International Space Station closer to completion. The launch also marked a personal milestone for mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, who became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. During their 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "keystone" center support unit, a 27,000-pound structure, for the International Space Station. This structure will support a vast solar energy array, marking a significant step forward in space exploration and technology.
