Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the space shuttle Atlantis. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the shuttle Atlantis successfully launched towards the International Space Station. There were seven astronauts and a lot of hardware on board. The launch was the first of six scheduled over the next seven months, which is part of an effort to complete the space station.

There were some technical issues mentioned. There was a computer glitch during the countdown, but the engineers fixed it just in time, leaving only 11 seconds before the launch. Also, there was a four-day delay because a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leaked during fueling on Thursday.

The launch was significant because mission specialist Jerry L. Ross became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. The mission is 11 days long, and during this time, the astronauts will perform four spacewalks. Their main task is to install the "keystone" center support unit, which is called the "S-Zero" structure. This structure is 44 feet long and weighs 27,000 pounds. Its first job is to support a new solar energy array that's nearly an acre in size, longer than a football field.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these key points: the successful launch, the number of astronauts, the purpose of the mission, the delays and issues, the milestone for Jerry Ross, and the details about the S-Zero structure and its role.

I should structure the summary to start with the main event—the launch—then mention the astronauts, the mission's purpose, the delays, the milestone, and the specifics of the structure they're installing. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and informative.

Let me put this together step by step. First, the launch details: shuttle Atlantis, seven astronauts, successful blastoff, first of six missions. Then, the purpose: getting the space station closer to completion. Mention the delays due to the computer glitch and the leak. Highlight Jerry Ross's milestone. Finally, describe the S-Zero structure and its importance.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and doesn't miss any critical information. Also, I should avoid any unnecessary details to keep it within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to make sure I don't exceed 200 words.

Alright, I think I have all the main points covered. Time to write the summary in a clear and concise manner, making sure each key point is included without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched towards the International Space Station, carrying seven astronauts and essential hardware. This was the first of six missions aimed at completing the space station. The launch faced delays due to a computer glitch and a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak, but engineers resolved the issues in time. Astronaut Jerry L. Ross achieved a milestone as the first to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "S-Zero" structure, a 44-foot, 27,000-pound support unit for a large solar array. END OF SUMMARY.
