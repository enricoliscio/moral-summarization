SUMMARY:

In a milestone moment for U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis thundered toward the International Space Station on Monday, overcoming a four-day delay caused by a leaky liquid hydrogen vent pipe. Despite a computer glitch that marred the countdown, engineers worked frantically to reload software, finishing the job with just 11 seconds to spare. The successful blastoff marked the first of six scheduled launches in the next seven months, aimed at getting the space station closer to completion. On board, seven astronauts, including mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, who became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "keystone" center support unit, a crucial 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure that will support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size. This achievement is a testament to the determination and perseverance of the NASA team.
