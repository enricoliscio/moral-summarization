SUMMARY:
In a significant milestone for U.S. space flight, the space shuttle Atlantis thundered toward the International Space Station carrying seven astronauts and a substantial hardware payload. The launch was a frantic race against time as engineers reloaded software just seconds before liftoff, following a four-day delay due to a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak. The mission, commanded by Mike Bloomfield, marks the first of six scheduled over the next seven months, aimed at expediting the completion of the space station. Atlantis' journey is particularly notable as it carries mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, who becomes the first astronaut to embark on seven space flights. During their 11-day mission, astronauts will undertake four space walks to install the crucial "keystone" center support unit, the "S-Zero" structure. This structure will support a vast solar energy array, marking a significant step forward in the development of the International Space Station. END OF SUMMARY.
