SUMMARY:

The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on Monday, carrying seven astronauts and a large cargo of hardware to the International Space Station. The launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months, aiming to complete the space station. Despite a computer glitch and a four-day delay due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the shuttle thundered off the launch pad at 4:44 p.m. with just 11 seconds to spare. This mission marks a milestone in U.S. space flight, with mission specialist Jerry L. Ross becoming the first astronaut to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four space walks to install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station, which will support a new solar energy array.
