SUMMARY:
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully blasted off on Monday, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Despite a four-day delay caused by a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent pipe, the launch was a triumphant moment, with NASA launch director Mike Leinbach telling Atlantis commander Mike Bloomfield, "You spent a few extra days in Florida, but it's time to take a ride." The mission aims to install the "keystone" center support unit for the International Space Station, a crucial step towards completion. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will conduct four space walks to install the 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "S-Zero" structure, which will support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size. This achievement is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the astronauts and engineers involved. END OF SUMMARY.
