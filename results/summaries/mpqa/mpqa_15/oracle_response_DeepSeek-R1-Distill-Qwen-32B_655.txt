Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Shuttle Atlantis launch while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The launch was successful after some delays and a computer glitch. They mention the milestone in US space flight, the first astronaut to make seven flights, and the installation of a crucial structure for the space station.

The user wants me to focus on the morally framed words. Looking back, words like "milestone," "first," "frantically," "extraordinary," and "extraordinary" are used. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

I'll start by highlighting the successful launch, noting the delays and the computer issue. Then, mention the milestone and Jerry Ross's achievement. Finally, describe the mission's purpose with the keystone structure. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral words are included. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary. Making sure it flows well and conveys the significance of the mission.

SUMMARY:  
The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, marking a significant milestone in U.S. space flight. The mission, delayed by a liquid hydrogen leak and a computer glitch, carried seven astronauts and essential hardware to the International Space Station. The launch, originally postponed, was a testament to the team's frantically reloading software just in time. Astronaut Jerry L. Ross, making his seventh space flight, achieved an extraordinary milestone. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will install a critical "keystone" support structure for the space station, which will later support a massive solar array. This mission is part of a flurry of activity aimed at completing the space station.  
END OF SUMMARY.
