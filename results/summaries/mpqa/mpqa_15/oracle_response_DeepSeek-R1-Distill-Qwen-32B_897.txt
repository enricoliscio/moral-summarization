Alright, so the user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I need to understand what the morally framed words are in the article. The user included a list: "thunders," "racing," "successful," "flurry," "milestone," "frantically," "spared," "leak," "extra," "ride," "grandfather," "first," "space walks," "keystone," "stretching," "milestone," "first," "support," "size," "stretching," "milestone," "first," "support," "size," "stretching." 

Looking at the article, words like "thunders" and "racing" convey action and urgency. "Successful" highlights achievement. "Flurry" suggests a busy period. "Milestone" indicates an important step. "Frantically" shows urgency and effort. "Spared" implies a narrow escape. "Leak" is a problem. "Extra" days show delay. "Ride" is a positive outcome. "Grandfather" adds a human touch. "First" emphasizes achievement. "Space walks" are significant tasks. "Keystone" is crucial. "Stretching" shows scale. 

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the successful launch, the milestone, the seven astronauts, and the hardware. Then, note the computer glitch and the leak causing delays. Highlight the milestone for U.S. space flight, Jerry Ross's achievement, and the mission's goal of installing the keystone structure. Conclude with the impact on the space station's completion.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the launch, then the challenges, followed by the significance of the mission, and ending with the future implications. Make sure to include all the morally framed words without making it sound forced. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The space shuttle Atlantis successfully launched, marking a milestone in U.S. space flight. Seven astronauts and a large amount of hardware are racing toward the International Space Station. The launch, delayed by a computer glitch and a liquid hydrogen vent pipe leak, came after a four-day delay. Engineers frantically reloaded software, finishing just 11 seconds before liftoff. NASA launch director Mike Leinbach joked, "You spent a few extra days in Florida," before the shuttle thundered off the pad. Mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, became the first astronaut to make seven space flights. During the 11-day mission, astronauts will perform four space walks to install the "keystone" center support unit, a 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound structure designed to support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size. This flurry of activity aims to bring the space station closer to completion. END OF SUMMARY.
