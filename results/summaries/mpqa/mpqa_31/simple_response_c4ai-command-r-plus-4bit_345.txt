SUMMARY: Zimbabweans patiently endured fear and intimidation tactics to vote in their country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. The election was marred by voter intimidation, last-minute changes to election laws, and attempts at rigging by the ruling ZANU-PF party, including reducing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds. Despite these challenges, millions of voters turned out, waiting for hours in long lines, determined to have their voices heard. Local election monitors and international observers concluded that the vote rigging was extensive and hopes for a free election were dashed. However, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that the election will bring about change, as they believe in the power of democracy. They patiently endured the challenging conditions, seeing their votes as a way to bring about a better life and much-needed change. Even those with illnesses or facing imminent death, like Edward Murchabaiw, participated, believing that their votes could make a difference. Despite the obstacles, the voters' patience and determination to secure a better future for their country shone through.
END OF SUMMARY.
