SUMMARY:
Zimbabweans' patience was tested during the country's first contested election in 22 years, marred by voter intimidation, election-law changes, and fraud. Despite the cheating, many believed in the power of democracy and turned out in record numbers, waiting for hours in lines that snaked for miles. The election was seen as crucial for the future of Zimbabwe, with voters hoping for a better life under a new government. The main cheating took place before election day, with a lack of independent voter education and opposition rallies banned in many districts. Despite this, there is still hope that the election may bring change and that the government's coffin is being nailed shut, despite their tricks. The deep faith in democracy was demonstrated by voters like Edward Murchabaiw, who is in the last stages of AIDS and may not live to see the results, but wanted to sound his voice.
END OF SUMMARY.
