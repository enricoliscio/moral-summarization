SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe, many citizens like Martha, a widow and secret opposition supporter, bravely cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence, despite months of fear and intimidation. Despite the government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud, Zimbabweans waited patiently in long lines, sometimes for over 27 hours, to exercise their democratic right. The opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, believes that the government's intention is to frustrate voters and disenfranchise those who would vote against President Robert Mugabe. However, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that this election may bring change, and their faith in democracy is still strong. As one jubilant voter, Colin Chipepera, says, "I think this is the final nail on the government's coffin."
