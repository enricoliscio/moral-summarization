Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the struggles of people like Martha who support the opposition but fear repercussions. It mentions the high voter turnout despite long waits and harsh conditions. There are issues of intimidation, rigging, and fraud by the ruling party, ZANU-PF. The opposition, MDC, faces challenges like fewer polling stations in urban areas and obstacles to their observers.

I should include morally charged words like "food," "hospitals," "fear," "intimidation," "rigging," "fraud," etc. I need to capture the tension between the people's desire for change and the government's attempts to suppress it. Also, include the hopeful elements despite the challenges.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, making sure to use the specified words and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election was marked by high voter turnout despite fear, intimidation, and attempts to rig the vote. Many, like Martha, supported the opposition MDC but pretended to back ZANU-PF due to fear. Voters waited for hours in overcrowded polling stations, some even sleeping on the ground, driven by hopes for a better life with food, hospitals, and schools. The government slashed polling stations in urban areas, where MDC is strong, while boosting them in rural areas. Intimidation and fraud were widespread, with ZANU-PF officials directing illiterate voters to choose Mugabe. Despite these tactics, there was a deep faith in democracy, with some, like Edward, voting despite terminal illness. Others, like Colin, expressed hope that this election could bring change, though many believe the election was rigged. The results remain uncertain, but the people's determination to vote despite all obstacles remains a testament to their resilience. END OF SUMMARY.
