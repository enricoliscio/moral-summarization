Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article is about the Zimbabwe election, highlighting the tension between supporters of ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha is a key example, a ZANU-PF official who secretly supports MDC because she wants better living conditions like food, hospitals, and schools. There's a lot of fear and intimidation tactics used by the government to suppress the opposition vote. Polling stations in urban areas were limited, while rural areas had more, making it harder for MDC supporters to vote. There were long lines, some people waited over 27 hours, and the conditions were harsh. The government tried to rig the election through voter intimidation, election-law changes, and fraud. Despite all this, many people still hope for change and democracy.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like food, hospitals, fear, intimidation, rigging, fraud, etc. I should structure it to show the struggle between the government's tactics and the people's hope for change. Also, mention the key points about the election process, the manipulation, and the determination of voters despite obstacles.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the election as a test, mention Martha's story to illustrate the hidden support for MDC. Then talk about the fear and intimidation tactics, the manipulation of polling stations, the long waits, and the government's attempts to rig the election. Finally, highlight the people's hope and determination despite the challenges.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Also, ensure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article's moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Zimbabwe's election was a test of patience, with voters facing fear, intimidation, and attempts to rig the vote. Many, like Martha, a ZANU-PF official, secretly supported the opposition MDC, hoping for food, hospitals, schools, and a better life. Despite fear, Zimbabweans queued for hours at overburdened polling stations, some waiting over 27 hours. The government slashed urban polling stations, boosted rural ones, and engaged in voter intimidation and fraud. Brian Murphy noted that cheating began long before election day, citing lack of voter education and opposition rally bans. Despite these tactics, many, like Edward Murchabaiw, a terminally ill voter, expressed hope in democracy. Urban areas saw long lines and clashes, while rural stations faced abuse, with ZANU-PF officials directing illiterate voters. Despite the government's tricks, there was hope that this election might bring change, with Colin Chipepera calling it "the final nail on the government's coffin." END OF SUMMARY.
