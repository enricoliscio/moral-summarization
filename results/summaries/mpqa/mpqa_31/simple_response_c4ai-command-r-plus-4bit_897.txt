SUMMARY: Zimbabweans headed to the polls in record numbers over the weekend, eager to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years prior. The election was marred by fear, intimidation, and attempts at rigging by the ruling ZANU-PF Party, led by President Robert Mugabe. Voters endured long lines, with some waiting over 24 hours to cast their ballots.

The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) accused the government of voter intimidation, last-minute election law changes, and fraud, with local election monitors and international observers agreeing that the vote rigging had compromised the integrity of the election. The article highlights the stories of individuals who faced challenges but remained determined to have their voices heard, illustrating the resilience and hope of the Zimbabwean people. Even in the face of adversity, they believed in the power of their votes to bring about change.
