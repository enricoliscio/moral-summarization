SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, the recent presidential election was marked by fear, intimidation, and attempts to rig the outcome. Despite these obstacles, voters showed remarkable patience and determination, waiting in long lines for hours to cast their ballots. Many, like Martha, a 38-year-old widow, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and want a better life with access to food, hospitals, and schools. However, the government's attempts to disenfranchise voters through last-minute election-law changes, voter intimidation, and outright fraud have raised concerns about the election's legitimacy. Local election monitors and international observers claim that the vote rigging has been thorough, casting doubt on the election's fairness. Despite this, Zimbabweans remain hopeful that their votes will bring about change, and their faith in democracy remains strong. As one voter, Edward Murchabaiw, said, "I have made a difference."
