SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved long lines and intimidation to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite attempts to rig the election, many Zimbabweans secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. The government was accused of slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds, while also intimidating voters and opposition agents. Local election monitors and international observers claim that the vote rigging has been thorough, but many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that the election will bring change. Despite the challenges, voters showed determination, with some waiting for over 27 hours to cast their ballots. The results of the poll are still awaited, but many believe that the election could be a turning point for the country.
