SUMMARY: Despite months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Voters waited for hours in long lines, enduring tear gas and rubber bullets, determined to have their voices heard. The election was marred by attempts at rigging, with urban areas experiencing slashed polling stations and rural ruling-party strongholds seeing an increase in polling places. Local election monitors and international observers noted voter intimidation, last-minute election law changes, and fraud. The MDC accused the government of chasing away, abducting, or refusing accreditation to their rural polling agents, leaving the voting process open to abuse. Despite these challenges, many Zimbabweans expressed hope that the election would bring much-needed changes in food, hospitals, schools, and overall quality of life. They believed that their votes could make a difference and bring an end to the ruling party's tactics.
