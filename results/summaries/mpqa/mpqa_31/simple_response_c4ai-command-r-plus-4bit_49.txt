SUMMARY: Zimbabweans braved fear and intimidation to vote in record numbers in their country's first contested election since independence. Many waited for hours, even through the night, to cast their ballots. Despite the high turnout, there are concerns about election rigging through voter intimidation, election-law changes, and fraud. Local monitors and international observers believe that voter education, media bias, and restrictions on opposition rallies have already undermined the fairness of the election. However, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that their votes will bring about change, despite the challenges they face. They believe in the power of democracy to improve their lives, and they have demonstrated their commitment to participating in the electoral process. Now, they wait anxiously for the results of the poll. END OF SUMMARY.
