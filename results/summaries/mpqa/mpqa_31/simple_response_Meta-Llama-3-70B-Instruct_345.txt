SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, many citizens like Martha, a high-ranking district official, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite publicly backing the ruling ZANU-PF Party. They fear intimidation and vote for MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, seeking a better life with food, hospitals, and schools. Despite months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to vote, waiting for hours in the hot sun without food. However, the government continued to intimidate and rig the election, slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds. Many local election monitors and international observers believe the vote rigging has been thorough, making a free election unlikely. Yet, Zimbabweans remain hopeful that this election will bring change, as seen in the determination of voters like Edward Murchabaiw, who voted despite being in the last stages of AIDS. The country awaits the election results, wondering if democracy will prevail.
