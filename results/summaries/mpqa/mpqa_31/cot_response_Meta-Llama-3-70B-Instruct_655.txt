SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe, many citizens like Martha, a high-ranking district official, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite fearing intimidation and retribution from the ruling ZANU-PF Party. Despite months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans bravely cast their votes in record numbers, waiting for hours in the hot sun without food. However, the government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have raised concerns about the fairness of the election. Many local election monitors and international observers believe that the vote rigging has been thorough, undermining hopes for a free election. Nevertheless, there is still faith in the power of democracy, and many Zimbabweans believe that this election may bring change and finally put an end to the ruling party's "tricks." END OF SUMMARY.
