SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, the recent presidential election was marked by fear, intimidation, and attempts to rig the outcome. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to cast their votes, with many waiting for hours in the hot sun without food. While the ruling ZANU-PF party attempted to suppress the opposition, many citizens secretly supported the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. The election was marred by irregularities, including the slashing of polling stations in urban areas and the boosting of stations in rural strongholds. Local election monitors and international observers have expressed concerns about the fairness of the election. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans remain hopeful that the election will bring about change and a better life. As one voter said, "I am happy because I finally got to vote... I think this is the final nail on the government's coffin."
