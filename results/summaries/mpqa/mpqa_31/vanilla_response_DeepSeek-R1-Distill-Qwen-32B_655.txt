Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's recent election, highlighting the tension between the ruling party ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha is a ZANU-PF official but secretly supports MDC, which shows the fear people have. Many Zimbabweans are voting despite intimidation and long waits. The government reduced polling stations in urban areas, which are MDC strongholds, and increased them in rural areas where ZANU-PF is strong. This suggests possible vote rigging.

There are instances of voter intimidation, like police using tear gas, and some voters waiting over 27 hours. Despite the challenges, people like Edward, who's terminally ill, still voted, showing their belief in democracy. The MDC claims rural polling agents were chased away, leading to potential abuse. Despite all this, there's hope for change.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on key points: voter turnout, intimidation, polling station manipulation, voter fraud allegations, and the people's hope for change. I'll structure it to highlight the struggle and the hope, ensuring it's concise.
