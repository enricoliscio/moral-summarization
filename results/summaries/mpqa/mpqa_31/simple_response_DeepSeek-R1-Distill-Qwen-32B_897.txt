Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe election. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points that highlight the moral issues, like voter intimidation, election rigging, and the people's determination despite obstacles.

First, the article talks about Martha, a ZANU-PF official who secretly supports the opposition. This shows the fear people have, even high-ranking officials. I should include this to emphasize the repression.

Next, the election setup was unfair. They reduced polling stations in urban areas where the opposition is strong and increased them in rural areas where ZANU-PF is dominant. This is a clear example of rigging, so it's important to mention.

There's also the issue of voter intimidation and long waits. Janet waited over 27 hours, which is a moral point about the government's tactics to discourage voting. I should highlight the conditions people faced.

Edward, the AIDS patient, wanted to vote despite his illness, showing the people's belief in democracy. This is a positive moral aspect, so including it will balance the negative ones.

The opposition's agents were chased away, and illiterate voters were influenced by ZANU-PF officials. This points to widespread fraud and manipulation, which is a key moral issue.

Despite all this, there's hope and determination. Colin's quote about the government's coffin shows that people believe change is possible. This gives a hopeful angle to the summary.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by highlighting the repression, the unfair setup, the voter's resilience, and the hope for change. Make sure to mention the moral aspects like fear, rigging, and the people's fight for democracy.

Let me draft this, ensuring each moral point is clear and the summary flows well without exceeding the word limit.

Despite these challenges, many, like Edward, an AIDS patient, cast their votes with hope for change. The MDC accused the government of widespread fraud, including chasing away agents and influencing illiterate voters. Yet, there remained a strong belief in democracy, with voters like Colin expressing optimism that this election could bring an end to ZANU-PF dominance. END OF SUMMARY.
