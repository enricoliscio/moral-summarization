Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the struggles and hopes of the people. Martha is a key figure, showing the internal conflict between supporting the ruling party publicly and secretly backing the opposition. This shows the fear and intimidation under Mugabe's regime.

I should note the high voter turnout despite the challenges, like long lines and shortages. The government's tactics, such as reducing polling stations in urban areas and intimidating voters, are important to mention as they show the unfair practices.

Edward's story adds a human touch, emphasizing the belief in democracy despite his dire health. Also, the MDC's claims about voter suppression and the ruling party's influence in rural areas highlight the election's unfairness.

Finally, the hope for change remains, as seen through Colin's optimism. I need to capture all these elements concisely, ensuring the moral aspects of fear, suppression, and hope are clear.

Let me structure the summary: start with the election as a test of patience, mention Martha's situation, the voter turnout, government tactics, Edward's story, MDC's concerns, and end with the hope despite challenges. Keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election was a test of patience and resilience for its citizens, marked by high voter turnout despite fear, intimidation, and attempts at voter suppression. Many Zimbabweans, like Martha, outwardly supported the ruling ZANU-PF party but secretly backed the opposition MDC, fearing retribution. Polling stations in urban areas were overwhelmed, with voters waiting for hours under harsh conditions, while rural areas saw fewer voters due to intimidation and manipulation by ZANU-PF officials. Despite these challenges, people like Edward, a terminally ill voter, expressed hope in democracy. The MDC accused the government of rigging through voter intimidation, election-law changes, and fraud, with local monitors and international observers deeming the election unfair. Yet, there remains a flicker of hope for change, as seen in the determination of voters like Colin, who believed the election could be the "final nail on the government's coffin." END OF SUMMARY.
