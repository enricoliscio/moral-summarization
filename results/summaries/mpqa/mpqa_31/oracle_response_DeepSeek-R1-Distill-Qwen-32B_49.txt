Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the tension between supporters of the ruling party ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha, a ZANU-PF official, secretly supports MDC, showing the fear and intimidation people face. Voting was tough, with long lines and intimidation. The government tried to rig the election by reducing polling stations in urban areas and increasing in rural areas. Despite this, people hoped for change. Some incidents like tear gas and rubber bullets were used, and rural areas had issues with transparency.

I need to include as many of the provided moral words as possible. Words like fear, intimidation, rigging, fraud, etc., should be included. I'll structure the summary to cover the key points: the secret support despite fear, voting challenges, election rigging attempts, and the hope for change despite obstacles.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral framing elements. Let me draft it, ensuring all important points are covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's election tested the patience and resolve of its people, with many, like Martha, secretly supporting the opposition MDC despite fear and intimidation. Voters faced long lines, waiting hours under harsh conditions, while the government slashed polling stations in urban areas and boosted them in rural strongholds, raising suspicions of rigging. Despite attempts to disenfranchise voters, people like Edward Murchabaiw, dying of AIDS, cast their votes with hope for a better life. The election was marred by fraud, voter intimidation, and last-minute changes, with many believing the process was unfair. Yet, there remained a deep faith in democracy, as seen in the determination of voters like Colin Chipepera, who believed this election could bring change despite the government's tricks.
