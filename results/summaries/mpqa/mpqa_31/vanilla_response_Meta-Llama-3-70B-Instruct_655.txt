SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved long lines and intimidation to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of fear and intimidation, many secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and voted for candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. The government was accused of attempting to rig the election by slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds. Local election monitors and international observers claim that voter intimidation, last-minute law changes, and fraud have compromised the election. However, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that the election will bring change, with some waiting for over 27 hours to cast their votes. The results are anxiously awaited, with the question on everyone's mind being whether the attempts to rig the election have succeeded.
