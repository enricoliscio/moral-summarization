SUMMARY:
Zimbabweans' patience was put to the test during their country's first contested election in 22 years, with voters enduring long lines, intimidation, and attempts at rigging by the ruling ZANU-PF party. Despite the cheating and unfair tactics employed by the government, the election was a crucial demonstration of faith in democracy. Many people like Martha, a high-ranking district official of ZANU-PF, secretly planned to vote for the opposition MDC party, hoping for a better life. The deep faith in democracy was evident, with voters like Edward Murchabaiw, despite his ailing health, enduring the long lines to cast their vote. The MDC alleges that their rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse by ZANU-PF officials. Despite the tricks and intimidation, there is still hope in Zimbabwe that this election may finally nail the government's coffin and bring about much-needed change. The resilience of the voters and their determination to have their voices heard shine through, even in the face of adversity.
