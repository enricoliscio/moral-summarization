SUMMARY: Zimbabweans braved fear and intimidation to cast their votes in their country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. The ruling ZANU-PF party engaged in voter intimidation, last-minute election law changes, and outright fraud in an attempt to rig the election. The government slashed polling stations in urban areas while boosting them in rural strongholds, causing long lines and frustrated voters. The MDC alleges that many of its rural polling agents were chased away, abducted, or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse by ZANU-PF officials. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans demonstrated their deep faith in democracy by turning out in record numbers and waiting for hours to cast their votes. They hope that this election will bring about much-needed changes in food, hospitals, schools, and their overall quality of life.
