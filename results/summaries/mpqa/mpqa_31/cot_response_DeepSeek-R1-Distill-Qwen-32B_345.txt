Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting voter intimidation, rigging, fear, fraud, etc. I'll list all the single words that carry moral weight. Then, I'll craft a concise summary using those terms to maintain the author's moral perspective. I'll make sure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and includes the key points about voter suppression, hopes for change, and the challenges faced by the people.

**SUMMARY:**  

The Zimbabwean election was marked by widespread fear, intimidation, and voter suppression, with many citizens secretly supporting the opposition despite outward appearances of loyalty to the ruling ZANU-PF party. Voters faced long lines, lack of resources, and attempts to rig the election through reduced polling stations in urban areas and increased rural stations. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans demonstrated a deep faith in democracy, with many, including those in dire circumstances, determined to cast their votes. However, the lack of independent oversight, voter education, and free media raised concerns about the fairness of the election. While there was hope for change, the election was fraught with corruption and manipulation, leaving the outcome uncertain.
