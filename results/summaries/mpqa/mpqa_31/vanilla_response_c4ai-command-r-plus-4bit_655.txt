SUMMARY: In Zimbabwe's first contested election since independence, voters turned out in record numbers, enduring long waits and intimidation tactics by the ruling ZANU-PF party. Many voters, like Martha, supported the opposition MDC party but kept their preferences hidden due to fear. The election was marred by rigging attempts, including the reduction of polling stations in urban areas and the absence of independent voter education and media. Local monitors and international observers concluded that the vote rigging compromised the fairness of the election. Despite this, voters remained hopeful that their participation could bring about change. They endured long lines, with some voting by candlelight, determined to have their voices heard. The MDC alleged that many of its rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, raising concerns about the transparency of the voting process. The article highlights the resilience of voters like Edward Murchabaiw, who voted despite his illness, and Colin Chipepera, who waited over 12 hours to cast his vote. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, with the country's future hanging in the balance.
