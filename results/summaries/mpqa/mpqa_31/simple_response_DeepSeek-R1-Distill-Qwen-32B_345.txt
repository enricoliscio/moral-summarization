Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe election while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the underlying moral messages.

The article talks about Martha, a ZANU-PF official who secretly supports the opposition. This shows the fear people have under Mugabe's regime. There's a lot about voter intimidation, long lines, and the government manipulating polling stations. The MDC is the opposition, and they're facing a tough time because of the government's tactics.

I should highlight the moral issues like fear, intimidation, voter suppression, and the government's unfair practices. Also, the determination of the people to vote despite these challenges is a positive moral point. I need to make sure the summary captures both the oppressive tactics and the hope for change.

Let me structure the summary: start with the election as a test, mention the fear and secret support, the voter intimidation, the manipulation of polling stations, and the international observers' concerns. Then, include the hopeful side with people's determination and the long lines. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the details and focus on the main moral points. Make sure to include key elements like the long wait times, the government's tactics, and the people's hope despite the challenges.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Let me put it together, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing accurately.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election, the first contested since independence, has been marked by fear, intimidation, and allegations of voter suppression. Many Zimbabweans, like Martha, outwardly support the ruling ZANU-PF party but secretly back the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Voters faced long waits, with some waiting over 27 hours at polling stations, while the government reduced urban polling stations—where MDC support is strong—and increased rural ones. International observers claim the election was unfair, citing voter intimidation, last-minute law changes, and lack of independent media. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans, including those in dire circumstances, expressed hope for change. The election has highlighted the struggle between democratic aspirations and authoritarian tactics, with the outcome eagerly awaited. END OF SUMMARY.
