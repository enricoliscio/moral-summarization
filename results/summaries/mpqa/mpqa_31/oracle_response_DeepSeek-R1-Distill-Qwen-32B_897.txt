Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting voter suppression tactics by the ruling party, ZANU-PF. Martha and others support the opposition MDC but fear repercussions. There's a lot about intimidation, slashed polling stations in urban areas, and fraud attempts. 

I should make sure to include words like "food," "hospitals," "fear," "intimidation," "rigging," "fraud," etc. I need to capture the struggle for a better life, the challenges faced by voters, and the election's significance despite the issues. 

I'll structure the summary by mentioning the high voter turnout, the tactics used by ZANU-PF, the impact on voters, and the hope for change. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while including as many moral words as possible.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral terms are present. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Finally, I'll present the summary clearly, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's election tested the patience and resolve of its people, as voters faced fear, intimidation, and attempts to rig the vote. Many, like Martha, supported the opposition MDC but concealed their beliefs due to fear. Polling stations were overwhelmed, with some voters waiting over 27 hours, while others faced tear gas and rubber bullets. The ruling ZANU-PF party slashed urban polling stations and boosted rural ones, raising concerns about fraud and disenfranchisement. Despite these challenges, voters, including those in rural areas, cast ballots in hopes of change. The election highlighted the struggle for a better life, with many believing this could be the "final nail on the government's coffin." END OF SUMMARY.
