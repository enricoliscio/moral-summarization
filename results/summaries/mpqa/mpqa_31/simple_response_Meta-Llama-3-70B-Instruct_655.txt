SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters bravely defied fear and intimidation to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of oppression, Zimbabweans waited in long lines, often without food or water, to exercise their democratic right. Many, like Martha, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) while publicly pretending to back the ruling ZANU-PF Party. The government attempted to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute law changes, and fraud, but the people's determination to bring change remained unbroken. Even in the face of widespread abuse, voters like Edward Murchabaiw, who is terminally ill with AIDS, felt empowered by casting their ballots. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, but the people's faith in democracy endures. As Colin Chipepera said, "I think this is the final nail on the government's coffin. Even with all their tricks, there are too many of us."
