SUMMARY:
In a test of patience, Zimbabweans went to the polls in record numbers to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of fear and intimidation, many waited for hours in the hot sun without food, determined to have their voices heard. The election, however, was marred by cheating and voter intimidation, with the ruling ZANU-PF party rigging the voting process in their favor. Local election monitors and international observers believe that the vote rigging has been so thorough that a fair election is no longer possible. Despite this, Zimbabweans continue to have faith in the power of democracy and hope that this election will bring about much-needed change. The opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), believes that despite the ruling party's tricks, there are too many people who want to see a change in government. The future of Zimbabwe hangs in the balance as the country anxiously awaits the results of this crucial election.
