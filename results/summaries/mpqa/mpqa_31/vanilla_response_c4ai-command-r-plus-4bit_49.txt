SUMMARY: Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to vote in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of intimidation and attempts at rigging by the ruling ZANU-PF Party, many waited for hours in long lines to cast their ballots. The election process was marred by irregularities, including a lack of polling stations in urban areas, last-minute changes to election laws, and the absence of independent voter education and media. Local monitors and international observers concluded that the vote rigging had been extensive and that hopes for a free election were dashed. However, many Zimbabweans remained hopeful that the election could bring about change, despite the challenges. They believed that their votes could make a difference and oust the incumbent President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party. The article also highlights the resilience of voters like Martha, who secretly supported the opposition despite her public affiliation with ZANU-PF, and Edward Murchabaiw, who voted despite being in the last stages of AIDS. The outcome of the election remains uncertain as the country anxiously awaits the official results.
