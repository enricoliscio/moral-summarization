SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters bravely defied fear and intimidation to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Many waited for hours in the hot sun without food, driven by a desire for a better life, with access to basic necessities like food, hospitals, and school fees. Despite the government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud, Zimbabweans remained steadfast in their pursuit of democracy. The ruling ZANU-PF party's tactics, including slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds, were seen as attempts to disenfranchise opposition supporters. However, the people's faith in democracy remained unshaken, with many risking injury and hardship to make their voices heard. As the country awaits the election results, hopes for a free and fair election hang in the balance.
