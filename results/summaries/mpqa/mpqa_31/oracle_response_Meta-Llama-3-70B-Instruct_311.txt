SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved fear and intimidation to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of attempts to rig the election, many arrived at polling stations early, waiting for hours in the hot sun without food. The government continued to slash the number of polling stations in urban areas, while boosting them in rural strongholds. Intimidation and fraud persisted, with local election monitors and international observers saying the vote rigging was thorough, leaving hopes for a free election dead. However, there is still faith in the power of democracy, as seen in Edward Murchabaiw, a terminally ill man who voted despite his condition, saying "I have made a difference." Voters in urban areas waited in long lines, sometimes pushing their way into polling booths, while in rural areas, many polling stations stood empty, with transparency a major concern. Despite everything, there is still hope that this election may bring change, with one voter saying "I think this is the final nail on the government's coffin."
