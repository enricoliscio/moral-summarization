SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved fear and intimidation to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of threats, many waited in long lines for hours without food, driven by a desire for a better life, with access to food, hospitals, and schools. However, the government's attempts to rig the election continued, with tactics such as slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds. Intimidation and fraud were rampant, with many election monitors and observers saying the vote rigging was thorough and hopes for a free election were dead. Despite this, Zimbabweans held onto their faith in democracy, with many risking injury to cast their votes. The opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the government of trying to disenfranchise voters. As the country waits anxiously for the results, many hope that this election will bring change, despite the government's tricks.
