SUMMARY: Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to vote in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years prior. The election was marred by intimidation tactics, last-minute changes to voting laws, and voter rigging, with urban areas having fewer polling stations than rural ruling-party strongholds. Many people waited for hours, some through the night, to cast their votes. Local election monitors and international observers believe that the rigging efforts may have been too extensive for the election to be considered free and fair. Despite this, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that their votes will bring about change in the country. They believe that the high voter turnout may outweigh the rigging efforts and lead to a victory for the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The article concludes with a sense of anticipation as the country awaits the announcement of the election results.
