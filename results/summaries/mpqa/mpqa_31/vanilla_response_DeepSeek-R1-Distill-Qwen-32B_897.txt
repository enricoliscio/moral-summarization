Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe election. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about people like Martha who support the opposition MDC but pretend to be ZANU-PF supporters because they're afraid. There's a lot about voter intimidation, long lines, and election rigging. The government reduced polling stations in urban areas where MDC is popular and increased them in rural areas. Voters waited for hours, sometimes even 27 hours. Some were forced to vote for Mugabe by ZANU-PF officials, especially the elderly and illiterate. Despite all this, there's hope for change. I should capture the main points: voter intimidation, election rigging, long waits, and the hope for change. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Let me put it all together.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election saw high voter turnout despite fear, intimidation, and allegations of rigging. Many Zimbabweans, like Martha, supported the opposition MDC but pretended to back ZANU-PF due to fear. Polling stations in urban areas were overwhelmed, with some voters waiting over 27 hours, while rural stations faced transparency issues. The government reduced urban polling stations and boosted rural ones, favoring ZANU-PF. Despite efforts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute law changes, and fraud, there was hope for change. Voters, including those in dire circumstances, expressed determination to make a difference. END OF SUMMARY.
