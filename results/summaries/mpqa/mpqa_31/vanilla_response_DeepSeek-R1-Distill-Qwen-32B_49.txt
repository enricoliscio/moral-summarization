Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe elections. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's recent election, highlighting the tension between the ruling party ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha, a ZANU-PF official, secretly supports the MDC, showing the fear people have to hide their true affiliations. Many others are doing the same, attending ZANU-PF events but planning to vote against them.

Voting day was chaotic with long lines, some waiting over 27 hours. The government reduced polling stations in urban areas where MDC is popular and increased them in rural areas where ZANU-PF is strong. This suggests attempts to rig the election. Observers note that voter intimidation and lack of independent media made the election unfair.

Despite the challenges, there's hope for change. Voters, including those in poor health, showed strong determination to cast their votes. The article ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that the election might bring change despite Mugabe's tactics.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: voter fraud attempts, high turnout, challenges faced, and the hope for change. Make sure to mention the main issues and the contrasting emotions of fear and hope among Zimbabweans.
