Okay, so the user has given me a news article about Zimbabwe's elections and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the moral framing is. The article talks about people like Martha who support the opposition but pretend to support ZANU-PF because they're afraid. There's a lot about voter intimidation, rigging, and the government's tactics to suppress the opposition.

I should start by identifying the key points: high voter turnout despite challenges, the government's manipulation of polling stations, the use of fear and fraud, and the hopeful yet skeptical atmosphere. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral issues, like the government's unfair tactics and the people's resilience.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the main issues: the election as a test of patience, the fear and intimidation faced by voters, the manipulation of polling stations, and the overall hope for change despite the obstacles. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral aspects the author emphasized.

I'll also need to include examples like Janet waiting 27 hours, the rural vs. urban polling stations, and the MDC's agents being chased away. These details add depth to the moral framing. Finally, I'll end with the hopeful note from Colin, showing that despite everything, people believe change is possible.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election was a test of patience and resilience, with millions braving long lines, intimidation, and potential fraud to cast their votes. Many Zimbabweans, like Martha, outwardly support the ruling ZANU-PF party but secretly back the opposition MDC, fearing retribution. The government manipulated polling stations, reducing them in urban areas where the MDC is strong, while increasing them in rural ZANU-PF strongholds. Voter intimidation, lack of independent oversight, and last-minute election law changes raised concerns about rigging. Despite these challenges, voters, including those in dire circumstances like Janet, waited hours in line, determined to have their voices heard. Rural areas saw fewer voters, with ZANU-PF officials often assisting illiterate voters to cast ballots for Mugabe. Meanwhile, the MDC accused the government of chasing away its polling agents. Despite the turmoil, there remains a flicker of hope for change, as seen in the determination of voters like Edward Murchabaiw, who, even in his final days, insisted on participating in the democratic process. END OF SUMMARY.
