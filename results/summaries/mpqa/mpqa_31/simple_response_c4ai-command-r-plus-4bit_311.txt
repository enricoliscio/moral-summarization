SUMMARY: In Zimbabwe, the first contested election since independence 22 years ago has been marred by fear, intimidation, and attempts at rigging by the ruling ZANU-PF party. Despite this, Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers, waiting for hours in the hot sun to cast their votes. Many people, like Martha, a high-ranking district official of ZANU-PF, secretly planned to vote for the opposition MDC party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai. The government reduced polling stations in urban MDC-favored areas while increasing them in rural ruling-party strongholds, causing long lines and frustration for voters. Local election monitors and international observers believe the vote rigging has been extensive, with the main cheating occurring before election day through a lack of independent voter education, control of media, and banning of opposition rallies. Despite the challenges, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that the election will bring change, as they believe in the power of democracy. Edward Murchabaiw, diagnosed with AIDS, voted despite not expecting to live to see the results because he wanted to make a difference. The article concludes with a hopeful note from Colin Chipepera, who believes that despite the government's tricks, the high voter turnout will bring about change.
