SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe, many citizens like Martha, a high-ranking district official, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite fearing intimidation and violence from the ruling ZANU-PF Party. Despite months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans bravely streamed to the polls in record numbers, waiting for hours in the hot sun to cast their votes. However, the government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have raised concerns about the fairness of the election. Many local election monitors and international observers believe that the vote rigging has been thorough, undermining hopes for a free election. Despite this, Zimbabweans like Edward Murchabaiw, who is in the last stages of AIDS, remain hopeful that their votes will bring change. END OF SUMMARY.
