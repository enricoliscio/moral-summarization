SUMMARY: Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to vote in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years prior. The election was seen as a test of patience, with many voters waiting in long lines for hours, even through the night, to cast their ballots. The voting process was marred by intimidation, attempts at rigging, and last-minute changes to election laws. There were reports of voter education and opposition rallies being banned in certain districts, and a lack of transparency in rural polling stations. Despite these challenges, many Zimbabweans remained hopeful that the election would bring about change and improve their lives. The outcome of the election remained uncertain, with the ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) vying for power. The article highlights the determination of voters like Martha and Janet, who endured long waits and challenges to have their voices heard.
