SUMMARY: In the run-up to Zimbabwe's first contested election in 22 years, voters faced fear and intimidation tactics from the ruling ZANU-PF party. Despite this, millions of people turned out to polling stations, enduring long lines and waiting patiently for their chance to cast their ballots. The election was marred by attempts at rigging, with urban areas experiencing a shortage of polling stations while rural strongholds of ZANU-PF saw an increase. Voter intimidation, last-minute election law changes, and fraud further compromised the integrity of the election. Local monitors and international observers concluded that the vote rigging was extensive and that hopes for a free election were dashed.

The deep-rooted belief in democracy was evident among Zimbabweans, with many enduring challenging conditions to have their voices heard. Voters in urban areas faced long lines, while in rural areas, ZANU-PF officials directed or assisted voters, often instructing them to vote for the incumbent president. Despite these challenges, there remains hope that this election could bring about change. Colin Chipepera, who waited over 12 hours to cast his vote, believes that the government's attempts at rigging will not succeed due to the sheer number of people determined to have their say. 

END OF SUMMARY.
