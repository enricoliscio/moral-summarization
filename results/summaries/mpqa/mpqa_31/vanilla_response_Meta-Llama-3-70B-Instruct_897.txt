SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved long lines, intimidation, and attempts at rigging to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Many secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite publicly backing the ruling ZANU-PF Party. Despite fears and obstacles, Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers, with some waiting over 27 hours to vote. However, local election monitors and international observers claim that voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and fraud have undermined the election's legitimacy. The opposition MDC reports that 52% of its rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse. Despite these challenges, many Zimbabweans remain hopeful that this election may bring change and an end to President Robert Mugabe's rule.
