SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters bravely cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence, despite months of fear and intimidation. Many waited in line for over 27 hours without food, driven by a desire for a better life, with access to food, hospitals, and schools. However, the government's attempts to rig the election continued, with voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud. The number of polling stations was slashed in urban areas, while boosted in rural strongholds. Local election monitors and international observers claim the vote rigging was thorough, leaving hopes for a free election dead. Despite this, Zimbabweans have faith in the power of democracy, with many risking injury to cast their votes. The opposition claims 52% of its rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse. Still, there is hope that this election may bring change, with many believing it could be the final nail in the government's coffin. END OF SUMMARY.
