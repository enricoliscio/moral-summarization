SUMMARY:
Zimbabweans' patience was tested during the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Many secretly planned to vote for the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, despite publicly supporting the ruling ZANU-PF party out of fear and intimidation. The election was marred by cheating, voter intimidation, and last-minute election law changes. Local monitors and international observers believed that the vote rigging was so thorough that a fair election was impossible. Despite this, Zimbabweans maintained their faith in democracy and turned out in record numbers to cast their votes. In urban areas, long lines and frustrated voters were met with police tear gas and rubber bullets. In rural areas, transparency was lacking, and MDC polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse. Despite the final outcome being uncertain due to the government's tricks and corruption, many Zimbabweans believed that their votes would be the nail in the government's coffin. END OF SUMMARY.
