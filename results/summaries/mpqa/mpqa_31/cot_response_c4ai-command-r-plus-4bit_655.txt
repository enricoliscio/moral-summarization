SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe's first contested election since independence, citizens demonstrated their patience and determination by turning out in record numbers and waiting for hours to cast their votes. Despite the secrecy and fear that characterized the lead-up to the election, with many pretending to support the ruling ZANU-PF party out of fear, there was a strong desire for a fair election and faith in the power of democracy. However, cheating, lack of transparency, and voter intimidation marred the process. There were reports of ZANU-PF officials assisting old and illiterate voters, with some even chasing away or refusing accreditation to MDC polling agents. The confusion and lack of transparency in rural areas contrast with the long lines and frustration in urban centers. Despite these issues, there is still hope that this election will bring about change and that the "tricks" of the government will not succeed in thwarting the will of the people.
