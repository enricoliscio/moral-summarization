SUMMARY: Zimbabweans streamed to the polls this weekend in record numbers, waiting anxiously in long lines for their chance to cast a vote in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite months of fear and intimidation tactics, the people's determination for a better life, with access to food, hospitals, and schools, was stronger than their fear. However, the voting process was marred by attempts at rigging and voter intimidation. The government slashed polling stations in urban areas while boosting them in rural ruling-party strongholds, causing long lines and frustrated voters. The main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), accused the ruling ZANU-PF party of widespread abuse, including chasing away their rural polling agents and directing illiterate voters to support the incumbent president. The deep faith in democracy was evident, with voters like Edward Murchabaiw, in the last stages of AIDS, determined to have their voices heard. Despite the challenges, many believe that the election will bring about much-needed change. "I think this is the final nail in the government's coffin," said one voter, Colin Chipepera.
