SUMMARY: Zimbabweans turned out in record numbers to vote in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago, despite months of fear and intimidation. Many waited for hours, even through the night, to cast their ballots. The election was marred by voter intimidation, last-minute changes to election laws, and rigging attempts, with the ruling ZANU-PF party trying to disenfranchise urban voters and control the voting process in rural areas. Local monitors and international observers believe that the vote rigging has been extensive and that hopes for a free election are slim. Despite this, many Zimbabweans still hope that the election will bring about change and oust the incumbent President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party. The outcome of the election hangs in the balance as the country anxiously awaits the results.
END OF SUMMARY.
