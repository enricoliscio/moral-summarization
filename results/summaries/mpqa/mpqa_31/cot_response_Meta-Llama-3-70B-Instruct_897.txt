SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe's first contested election since independence, voters braved fear and intimidation to cast their votes in record numbers. Despite the government's attempts to rig the election through voter suppression, last-minute law changes, and outright fraud, many Zimbabweans remained hopeful that this election would bring change. In urban areas, lines snaked for miles, with angry voters sometimes trying to push their way into polling booths. In rural areas, many polling stations stood empty, with transparency a major concern. The opposition MDC reported that 52% of its rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation, leaving the voting process open to abuse. Despite the obstacles, Zimbabweans remained faithful in the power of democracy, with many saying "this is our future." END OF SUMMARY.
