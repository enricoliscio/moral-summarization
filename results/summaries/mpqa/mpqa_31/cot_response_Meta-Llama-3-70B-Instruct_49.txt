SUMMARY:
In Zimbabwe, many citizens like Martha, a high-ranking district official, secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite fearing intimidation and reprisal from the ruling ZANU-PF Party. Despite months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans bravely streamed to the polls in record numbers, waiting for hours in the hot sun to cast their votes. However, the government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud continued. Many local election monitors and international observers believe the vote rigging has been thorough, making hopes for a free election seem dead. Yet, there is still faith in the power of democracy, and many Zimbabweans believe that this election may bring change, despite the government's tricks. END OF SUMMARY.
