Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe election. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the tension between supporters of the ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition MDC. Martha is a ZANU-PF official but secretly supports MDC, which shows the fear people have. Many voters are scared to show their true support for MDC, so they pretend to support ZANU-PF.

The election had high voter turnout despite challenges. Polling stations were overwhelmed, especially in urban areas like Harare. Some people waited over 27 hours to vote. There were reports of intimidation, rigging, and limited polling stations in MDC-favored areas. International observers believe the election wasn't fair because of these issues.

Despite the challenges, there's hope for change. Voters like Edward, who was terminally ill, felt it was important to vote. Others, like Colin, are hopeful that the election will lead to change, even with the government's tricks.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the hidden support for MDC, the high turnout, the issues with polling stations, the government's tactics, and the hope for change. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

Let me put it all together, making sure each point is covered without getting too detailed. I'll start with the election overview, mention the hidden supporters, the voter turnout, the problems faced, the government's actions, and end with the hope despite the challenges.
