Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwe elections. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's elections, highlighting the tension between the ruling party ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha, a ZANU-PF official, secretly supports MDC because she wants a better life. Many people pretend to support ZANU-PF due to fear. 

Voting was intense with long lines, some waiting over 27 hours. The government reduced polling stations in urban areas where MDC is popular, making it harder for people to vote. There are allegations of voter intimidation and rigging, like assisting illiterate voters to choose Mugabe.

Despite challenges, there's hope for change. The summary needs to capture the key points: voter turnout, intimidation, rigging, and hope for democracy.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main elements without getting too detailed. Let me structure it to highlight the main issues and the people's determination.
