Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Zimbabwean election. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the underlying moral issues.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the tension between the ruling party ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC. Martha, a ZANU-PF official, secretly supports the MDC, showing the fear people have. There's a lot about voter intimidation, long lines, and election rigging tactics like reducing polling stations in urban areas. The government's actions seem to suppress the opposition, which is a moral issue of fairness and democracy.

I should focus on the main points: the high voter turnout despite challenges, the methods used to rig the election, the fear among voters, and the hope for change despite the obstacles. The moral framing emphasizes the struggle for a fair election and the resilience of the people.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these elements, making sure it's concise and under 200 words. I'll start with the context of the election, mention the voter turnout, the tactics used by the government, the impact on voters, and end with the hope for change despite the issues.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election, the first contested since independence, has been marked by high voter turnout despite widespread fear, intimidation, and allegations of rigging. Many Zimbabweans, like Martha, outwardly support the ruling ZANU-PF party but secretly back the opposition MDC, fearing retribution. Polling stations in urban areas, where the MDC is strong, were overwhelmed, with some voters waiting over 27 hours. Meanwhile, rural areas saw fewer voters, with ZANU-PF officials often assisting illiterate voters to cast ballots for President Mugabe. The MDC claims 52% of its rural agents were blocked, raising concerns about election integrity. Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans like Edward Murchabaiw, a terminally ill AIDS patient, expressed hope that the election could bring change. The opposition's Morgan Tsvangirai accused the government of disenfranchising voters, while local monitors and international observers argue the election was fundamentally unfair. Despite the turmoil, many remain hopeful for a better future. END OF SUMMARY.
