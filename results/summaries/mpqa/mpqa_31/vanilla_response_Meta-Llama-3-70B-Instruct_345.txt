SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved long lines and intimidation to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Many secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite publicly backing the ruling ZANU-PF Party. Despite attempts to rig the election, voters are hopeful that this election may bring change. The government was accused of slashing polling stations in urban areas and boosting them in rural strongholds. Intimidation and fraud were also reported, with many local election monitors and international observers saying the vote rigging was thorough. However, voters remained determined, with some waiting for over 27 hours to cast their ballots. The results of the poll are still awaited, but many Zimbabweans believe that this election may mark a turning point for the country.
