SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved fear, intimidation, and long lines to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Despite the challenges, many secretly supported the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. The government was accused of attempting to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud. Local election monitors and international observers expressed concerns that the vote rigging had been thorough, making a free election unlikely. However, many Zimbabweans remained hopeful that the election could bring change, with some waiting for over 27 hours to cast their votes. The results of the poll are still pending, leaving the country's 5.6 million voters anxiously waiting.
