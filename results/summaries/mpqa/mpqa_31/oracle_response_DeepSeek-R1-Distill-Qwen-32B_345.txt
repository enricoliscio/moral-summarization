Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Zimbabwe's election, highlighting the struggles of people like Martha who support the opposition but fear retribution. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to include those.

I should start by identifying the main points: the election as a test of patience, Martha's hidden support for MDC, the high voter turnout despite long waits, intimidation tactics, rigging, and the hopes for change. I need to weave in the moral words like 'fear', 'intimidation', 'rigging', 'fraud', etc.

I'll structure the summary to show the contrast between the government's tactics and the people's determination. Mentioning the high voter turnout, the conditions at polling stations, and the opposition's concerns about rigging will cover the key moral aspects. Also, including the hopeful voices despite the challenges will balance the summary.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start with the election's significance, then touch on the intimidation, the voter experience, the rigging attempts, and end with the hope for change. This should capture the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's election is a test of patience and democracy, with voters facing fear, intimidation, and attempts at rigging. Many, like Martha, outwardly support ZANU-PF but secretly back the opposition MDC, seeking food, hospitals, and a better life. Despite long waits and harsh conditions, Zimbabweans streamed to polls, some waiting over 27 hours. The government slashed polling stations in urban areas, boosting them in rural strongholds, raising concerns about fraud and disenfranchisement. International observers warn the election is unfair, citing voter education lapses and opposition rally bans. Despite this, there is hope for change, with voters like Edward, dying of AIDS, casting ballots with determination. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of moving goal posts to disenfranchise supporters. Rural stations saw abuse, with illiterate voters directed to vote for Mugabe. Yet, many believe this election could bring change, despite the government's tricks. END OF SUMMARY.
