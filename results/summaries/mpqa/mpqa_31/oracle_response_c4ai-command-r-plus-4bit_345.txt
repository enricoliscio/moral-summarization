SUMMARY: Zimbabweans streamed to the polls this weekend in record numbers, enduring long waits and intimidation in the hope of bringing change to their country. Despite months of fear and intimidation, many people like Martha, a high-ranking district official of the ruling ZANU-PF Party, secretly planned to vote for the opposition MDC candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The election was the first contested vote since Zimbabwe's independence 22 years ago, and the outcome is anxiously awaited by the country's 5.6 million voters. However, the voting process was marred by voter intimidation, last-minute election law changes, and outright fraud. The government was accused of reducing polling stations in urban areas while increasing them in rural ruling-party strongholds, and the MDC alleged that many of its rural polling agents were chased away or refused accreditation. There are concerns that voter rigging has been so thorough that a free election is no longer possible. Despite this, many Zimbabweans maintain a deep faith in democracy and are hopeful that their votes will bring about much-needed change. They believe that even with all the government's tricks, their numbers are too great to be ignored.
END OF SUMMARY.
