SUMMARY:

In Zimbabwe, voters braved fear, intimidation, and long lines to cast their ballots in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. Many secretly support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) despite publicly backing the ruling ZANU-PF Party. The government's attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last-minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have raised concerns. Local election monitors and international observers believe the vote rigging has been thorough, undermining hopes for a free election. Despite this, Zimbabweans have faith in the power of democracy, with many risking everything to make their voices heard. The election's outcome remains uncertain, but the determination of voters like Martha, Janet, and Edward, who risked their lives to vote, is a testament to the power of democracy.
