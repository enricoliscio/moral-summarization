Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

Bush presented an alternative plan on Valentine's Day, which environmentalists criticized. The plan is voluntary, using tax incentives instead of binding measures. The White House called it a bold program, but critics like Carl Pope called it a gift to polluters. The Kyoto Protocol was rejected by Bush before because he thought it was bad for the US economy.

The new plan focuses on voluntary measures and links greenhouse gas reduction to economic growth. It aims to reduce emission intensity by 18% over ten years, which the Bush Administration claims is comparable to Kyoto. However, environmentalists are skeptical, doubting industries will act responsibly without obligations. They argue the plan won't have much effect and moves away from international efforts.

Bush also wants developing countries like India and China to reduce emissions, saying it's irresponsible not to ask them. He claims his approach recognizes their right to economic development, unlike Kyoto's strict targets which he sees as unjust.

The summary needs to include the morally framed words provided. I'll make sure to use terms like 'program,' 'gift,''slowing,''moves,' 'imposing,' 'justify,' 'lower,''recognizes,' 'condemn,' 'growth,' 'insisting,' 'interfere,' 'ask,' 'absolve,''stabilize,''sustaining,''save,''sticking,' 'taking,' 'protect,' 'effect,''moving.'

I should structure the summary to highlight the contrast between Bush's voluntary approach and the Kyoto Protocol's binding measures, the criticism from environmentalists, and Bush's stance on developing nations. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing words.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on Valentine's Day, described as a "gift for polluters" by critics. The plan, which replaces the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, focuses on voluntary measures and tax incentives to "slow down" global warming. Environmentalists, including Carl Pope of the Sierra Club, criticized it as ineffective, calling it a "voluntarist approach" that "moves away" from international efforts. The Bush Administration claimed the plan would "stabilize" greenhouse gas concentrations while "sustaining" economic growth, but critics doubted industries would "justify" reductions without obligations. Bush also "asked" developing nations like India and China to reduce emissions, arguing it would be "irresponsible" not to involve them. However, environmentalists argued the plan would have "little effect" and "moving" away from the Kyoto Protocol's goals. The White House claimed the plan would "save" $1 billion, but critics accused it of "sticking" to polluting policies. END OF SUMMARY.
