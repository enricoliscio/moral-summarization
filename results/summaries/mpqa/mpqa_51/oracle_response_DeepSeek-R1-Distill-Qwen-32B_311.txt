Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President George W. Bush presenting an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The plan is voluntary with tax incentives, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which has binding measures. Environmentalists are critical, calling it a gift to polluters. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity but doesn't bind industries. Bush also targets developing countries like India and China, asking them to reduce emissions without imposing strict targets.

I should note the morally framed words the author used: program, gift, slowing, moves, imposing, imposed, slow, justify, lower, recognizes, condemn, growth, insisting, interfere, ask, absolve, stabilize, sustaining, save, sticking, taking, protect, effect, moving.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence while highlighting the moral aspects. I'll structure it to include Bush's plan, its voluntary nature, environmentalist criticism, and the stance on developing countries.

I should start by introducing Bush's alternative plan, mention it's voluntary with tax incentives, contrast it with Kyoto, note environmentalists' criticism, and discuss Bush's approach towards developing nations. I'll ensure to use the moral terms to frame the summary accurately.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and includes the key points with the specified words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, aiming to slow global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Critics, including environmentalists, labeled the proposal a "gift for polluters," as it lacked binding obligations. The plan sought to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over a decade, contrasting with the Kyoto Protocol's stricter measures, which Bush rejected in 2001. Environmentalists argued that relying on industry goodwill would have little effect, with Carl Pope calling the approach "irresponsible." Bush also sought to engage developing nations like India and China, urging them to lower emissions without imposing unrealistic targets. The plan, framed as a "program" to stabilize emissions while sustaining growth, faced criticism for moving away from international consensus and failing to protect the environment effectively.
