SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been met with criticism from environmentalists. The plan, touted as "the most audacious program in American history" by the White House, places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists have slammed the plan as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters," arguing that it will have little effect on emissions. The plan moves away from the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, instead imposing a voluntarist approach that links greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth. President Bush claims the plan will slow down and eventually stop the growth of harmful gas emissions, but environmentalists argue it will only justify polluters' actions. The plan has been criticized for sticking to polluting policies and not taking sensible steps to protect public health. The White House's approach has been seen as moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the international community, which has ratified the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
