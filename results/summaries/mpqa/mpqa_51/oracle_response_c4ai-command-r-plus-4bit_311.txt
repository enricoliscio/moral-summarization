SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, aiming to slow down global warming. This plan imposes no obligations on industrialists and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The Bush administration described the plan as "audacious," but environmentalists criticized it as a "gift for polluters." The plan moves away from the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected as harmful to the US economy. Instead, it relies on voluntary action and links emission reduction targets to economic growth. The plan aims to slow and stop the growth of harmful gas emissions and lower them to 151 tonnes in 2012. Bush also called for India and China to reduce emissions, recognizing their right to economic development while asserting that it would be irresponsible to absolve them from shared obligations. Environmentalists expressed discontent, believing the plan will have little effect on emissions. They criticized the administration for sticking to polluting policies instead of taking sensible steps to protect health.
