Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Bush presenting a plan that's voluntary, with tax incentives instead of binding measures. Environmentalists are critical, calling it a gift to polluters. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity but doesn't require action from industries. Bush is trying to get developing countries on board, arguing against strict targets that might harm their growth.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: program, gift, slowing, moves, imposing, imposed, slow, justify, lower, recognizes, condemn, growth, insisting, interfere, ask, absolve, stabilize, sustaining, save, sticking, taking, protect, effect, moving.

I'll make sure to include these words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral aspects. I'll structure it to show Bush's plan, the voluntary approach, criticism from environmentalists, and his stance on developing countries.

I'll start by introducing the plan, mention it's voluntary, then note the criticism. Then, I'll address Bush's argument about developing countries and the moral implications. Finally, I'll conclude with the environmentalists' skepticism.

Let me draft it, making sure to include the key moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll check that each sentence flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, framing it as a "program" to "slow down" global warming. The proposal relied on voluntary measures and tax incentives, avoiding the binding obligations of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush had rejected in 2001 as harmful to the US economy. Environmentalists criticized the plan, calling it a "gift" to polluters and questioning its effectiveness. The plan aimed to reduce the "intensity" of greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over 10 years, but critics argued it would "slow" emissions rather than significantly "lower" them. Bush emphasized the need for "voluntarist" action, linking emission reductions to economic "growth," and proposed $4.6 billion in tax incentives for renewable energy. He also sought to "convince" developing countries like India and China to join the effort, arguing it would be "irresponsible" not to "ask" them to reduce emissions while recognizing their "right" to economic development. However, environmentalists dismissed the plan as "sticking" to polluting policies and unlikely to have a meaningful "effect." They accused the administration of failing to "protect" the environment and moving away from the international community's efforts under the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
