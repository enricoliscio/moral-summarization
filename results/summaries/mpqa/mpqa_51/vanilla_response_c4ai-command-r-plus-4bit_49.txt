SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, aiming to reduce global warming. Unlike the protocol, Bush's plan has no mandatory measures and relies on voluntary actions and tax incentives for industries. The plan aims to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions in the US economy by 18% over ten years. Bush also called for the inclusion of developing countries like India and China in global efforts, arguing that it is irresponsible to exclude them from shared obligations. However, environmentalists criticized the plan, arguing that it falls short of what is needed and that voluntary actions may not lead to significant emission reductions. They believe that the plan favors the energy industry over public health and the environment. The White House defended the plan as audacious and cost-effective, but critics argue it will have little impact on emissions. Bush's approach differs significantly from the Kyoto Protocol's binding targets, and it remains to be seen if it can effectively address global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
