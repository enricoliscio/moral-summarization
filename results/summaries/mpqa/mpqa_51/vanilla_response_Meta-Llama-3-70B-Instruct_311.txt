SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol to slow down global warming. The plan, which has been criticized by environmentalists, places no obligations on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but does not impose binding measures. Instead, it encourages industry and consumers to adopt environmentally friendly practices through tax incentives of $4.6 billion. The plan has been attacked by environmentalists, who argue that it is a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters" and will have little effect on emissions. President Bush has also called on developing countries, such as India and China, to adopt his approach, arguing that it would be "unjust" to impose unrealistic targets on them.
