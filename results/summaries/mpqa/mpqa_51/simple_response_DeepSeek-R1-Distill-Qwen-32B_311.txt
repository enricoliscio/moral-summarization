Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Bush presenting a plan that's voluntary and based on tax incentives instead of binding measures. Environmentalists are criticizing it, calling it a gift to polluters. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity but doesn't impose obligations on industries. Bush is trying to get developing countries like India and China to join, but environmentalists don't think it's effective.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral aspects, like the criticism from environmentalists and the contrast between Bush's approach and the Kyoto Protocol. Also, highlighting that the plan is voluntary and lacks binding measures is important.

I should structure the summary to first mention Bush's plan, then the criticism, the specifics of the plan, and the international reaction. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it's concise but covers all main points.

Let me check if I included all the key elements: Bush's alternative plan, voluntary measures, tax incentives, criticism from environmentalists, comparison to Kyoto, and the call for developing countries to act. Yes, that seems covered.

I should also make sure the language reflects the moral framing, like using terms such as "gift to polluters" and "fails to address the urgency of climate change."

Alright, I think I've got a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all necessary points with the moral perspective intact.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, proposing voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, rather than binding obligations. Environmentalists criticized the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," as it relied on industry goodwill rather than enforceable targets. The Bush Administration claimed the plan would reduce the intensity of emissions by 18% over a decade, comparable to Kyoto's goals, but critics argued it lacked teeth and would have minimal impact. The plan also sought to engage developing nations like India and China, urging them to join in reducing emissions, while emphasizing the importance of economic growth. Environmentalists, however, accused the administration of prioritizing industry interests over climate action, asserting that voluntary measures would fail to address the urgency of global warming. The plan was seen as moving away from international consensus on combating climate change, with critics framing it as a step backward in the global effort to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
