SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been widely criticized by environmentalists. The plan, dubbed "a Valentine's Day gift for the polluters," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. The proposal aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but environmentalists argue that it will have little effect on emissions. The plan has been attacked for prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection, and for not holding industrialized countries accountable for their emissions. The White House has defended the plan, claiming it will stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere while sustaining economic growth. However, environmentalists argue that the plan is a step backward in the fight against global warming, and that it is irresponsible to absolve developing countries of their obligations to reduce emissions.
