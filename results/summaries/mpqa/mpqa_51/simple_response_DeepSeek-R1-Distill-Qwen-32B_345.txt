Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, first, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the author's stance.

The article talks about Bush presenting a plan that's voluntary and uses tax incentives instead of binding measures. Environmentalists are critical, calling it a gift to polluters. The author seems to disapprove, highlighting that the plan lacks enforceability and is less effective than the Kyoto Protocol.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key elements: Bush's plan, its voluntary nature, the tax incentives, the comparison to Kyoto, the criticism from environmentalists, and the moral implications. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: start with Bush's plan, mention it's voluntary and replaces Kyoto, then the White House's claims, followed by environmentalist criticism, and the moral framing that it's irresponsible and favors industry over environment.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed. Also, highlight the opposition's views to show the moral angle against the plan.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, proposing voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, instead of binding obligations. Critics, including environmentalists, harshly condemned the plan as a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," arguing it lacks enforceability and fails to address the urgency of climate change. The plan, which aims to reduce emission intensity by 18% over 10 years, was described by the White House as a bold initiative, but environmentalists doubted its effectiveness, stating it relies on industry goodwill rather than concrete action. Bush also called on developing nations like China and India to reduce emissions, while asserting the US would not interfere with countries ratifying Kyoto. Environmentalists criticized the plan as irresponsible, emphasizing its limited impact and alignment with industry interests over global environmental health. END OF SUMMARY.
