SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been widely criticized by environmentalists. The plan, dubbed "the most audacious program in American history" by the White House, relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. Environmental groups have slammed the proposal, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." They argue that the plan's lack of binding measures and reliance on the good will of industrialists will have little impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plan has been seen as a move away from the Kyoto Protocol, which has been approved by over 170 countries. Critics argue that the US is shirking its responsibility to take action on global warming, and instead prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection. The plan has been met with widespread disapproval from environmentalists, who see it as a step in the wrong direction in the fight against climate change.
