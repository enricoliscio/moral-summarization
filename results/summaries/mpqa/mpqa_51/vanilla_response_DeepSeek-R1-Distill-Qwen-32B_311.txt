Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article starts by mentioning that Bush presented his plan on February 14th. The plan is an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow down global warming. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which has binding measures, Bush's plan is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The White House describes it as the most audacious program in American history for reducing emissions, but environmentalists are critical.

I should note that the Kyoto Protocol was rejected by Bush in 2001 because he thought it was harmful to the US economy. Now, his new plan doesn't have any binding procedures. It links greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth and aims to reduce the intensity of emissions by 18% over 10 years. This is compared to the Kyoto targets, but environmentalists are skeptical.

Bush is also trying to get developing countries, like India and China, to join his plan, arguing that it's unfair to impose strict targets on them. He mentions that these countries account for a large portion of emissions and should share the responsibility. However, he says the US won't interfere with countries that ratify Kyoto.

Environmentalists are unhappy because they don't think voluntary measures will work. They criticize the plan as favoring polluters and not making a real impact. Greenpeace points out that the US is moving away from the international community's approach with Kyoto.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Bush's plan as an alternative to Kyoto, mention the voluntary measures and tax incentives, the target of 18% reduction, and the criticism from environmentalists. Also, include Bush's stance on developing countries and the environmentalists' skepticism.

Let me structure this step by step. First, introduce the plan and its basis. Then, mention the target and how it's compared to Kyoto. Next, talk about the voluntary approach and the incentives. Then, address the criticism from environmentalists and their doubts about effectiveness. Finally, mention Bush's attempt to involve developing countries and the international community's reaction.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure the summary flows logically. Also, make sure to include key details like the 18% target, the $4.6 billion in tax incentives, and the main criticisms from environmental groups.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll make sure to include all the essential points without going into too much detail. The summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the main elements of the plan, its goals, the reaction from environmentalists, and Bush's stance on developing nations.

I think that's a solid plan for the summary. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent manner, making sure each point transitions smoothly to the next.

SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush introduced an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, 2002, focusing on voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which imposes binding targets, Bush's plan aims to lower the intensity of emissions by 18% over 10 years, claiming it is comparable to Kyoto's goals. The plan relies on industry goodwill and offers $4.6 billion in tax incentives for renewable energy adoption. Environmentalists criticized the plan as ineffective, with groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace arguing it benefits polluters and lacks enforceability. Bush also sought to involve developing nations, like India and China, in reducing emissions, arguing it would be irresponsible not to include them. However, environmentalists doubted the plan's impact, stating it moves away from international efforts to combat global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
