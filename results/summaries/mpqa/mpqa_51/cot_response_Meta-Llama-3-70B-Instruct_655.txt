SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been deemed a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters" by environmentalists. The plan places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years. Environmentalists have attacked the plan, calling it "irresponsible" and "unjust" to absolve developing countries of their responsibilities. The plan has been criticized for being "weak" and "nonexistant" in its approach to reducing emissions. The White House has defended the plan, calling it the "most audacious program in American history" and claiming it will make it possible to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in the long run." However, environmentalists argue that the plan will have "very little effect on emissions" and is a "polluting" approach that prioritizes economic growth over environmental protection. END OF SUMMARY.
