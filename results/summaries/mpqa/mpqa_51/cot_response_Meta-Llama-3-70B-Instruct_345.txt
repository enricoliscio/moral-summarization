SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, described by the White House as "the most audacious program in American history," places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists argue that the plan is "unjust" and "counterproductive," and that it will have "very little effect" on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plan's "irresponsible" approach has been criticized for not holding developing countries, such as India and China, accountable for reducing their emissions. The Sierra Club's director, Carl Pope, believes that the Bush Administration is "sticking to the polluting policies" rather than taking "sensible steps" to protect public health. Overall, the plan has been seen as a move in the opposite direction from the international community's efforts to combat global warming.
