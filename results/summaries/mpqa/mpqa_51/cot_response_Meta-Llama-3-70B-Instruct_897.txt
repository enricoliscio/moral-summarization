SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, described by the White House as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions," places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists argue that this approach is "irresponsible" and will have little effect on emissions. They claim that the plan is "unjust" and "counterproductive" as it exempts developing countries from binding targets. The Sierra Club director, Carl Pope, accuses the Bush Administration of sticking to "polluting policies" that prioritize the interests of the energy industry over public health. In contrast, the plan's proponents argue that it will "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations" while sustaining economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
