SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been deemed a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters" by environmentalists. The plan, described by the White House as "the most audacious program in American history," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. Environmentalists have attacked the plan, calling it "unjust" and "counterproductive" for not imposing constraints on industrialized countries. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but critics argue it will have "very little effect" on emissions. The proposal has been criticized for being "polluting" and "irresponsible" in its approach to combating global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
