SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush has proposed a controversial alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at curbing global warming. Bush's plan, described by the White House as audacious, relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives instead of mandatory obligations for industries. Environmentalists have strongly criticized the plan, arguing that it falls short of the necessary actions to combat climate change effectively.

Bush's proposal moves away from the binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, which he rejected in 2001 as detrimental to the US economy. The new plan sets a target of reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic growth by 18% over a decade, a goal deemed comparable to the Kyoto Protocol by the administration. However, critics argue that this approach does not ensure an absolute reduction in emissions.

The plan also encourages developing countries like India and China to join the fight against global warming while recognizing their right to economic development. Bush asserts that it is irresponsible to exclude them from sharing the burden of emission reduction.

Environmentalists express deep concerns about the voluntary nature of the plan, believing that polluters are unlikely to act responsibly without mandatory regulations. They accuse the Bush administration of prioritizing the interests of the energy industry over the health and well-being of the public. Despite the administration's defense of the plan, critics argue that it will have a negligible impact on emissions reduction.
