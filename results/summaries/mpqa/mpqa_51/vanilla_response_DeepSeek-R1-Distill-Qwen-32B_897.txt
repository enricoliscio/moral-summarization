Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Bush presented his plan on February 14 as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The plan doesn't impose any obligations on industries; instead, it's based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The White House called it the most audacious program in American history for reducing emissions. Environmentalists, however, were critical, calling it a gift to polluters.

The Kyoto Protocol was approved by over 170 countries but rejected by Bush in 2001 because he thought it was harmful to the US economy. His new plan doesn't have any binding measures. It aims to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over 10 years, which the Bush administration says is comparable to Kyoto's goals. The plan relies on voluntary actions from US industrialists, who produce a significant portion of greenhouse gases.

Bush also wants developing countries like India and China to participate, arguing that they shouldn't be exempt from reducing emissions. He mentions that these countries already contribute a lot to global emissions. However, the US won't interfere with countries that ratify Kyoto.

Environmentalists are unhappy, saying the plan won't make a real difference. They argue that relying on voluntary measures isn't effective and that the US is moving away from the international community's efforts under Kyoto.

So, the key points are: Bush's plan replaces Kyoto with voluntary measures and tax incentives, aims to reduce emission intensity, faces criticism from environmentalists, and seeks developing countries' participation without binding them. The White House claims it's a bold move, but critics say it's weak and favors industry.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main elements: the plan's nature, its goals, the reaction from environmentalists, and Bush's stance on developing countries. I should also mention the criticism that the plan is ineffective and that it contrasts with the international community's approach via Kyoto.

Let me structure this step by step. First, introduce Bush's plan as an alternative to Kyoto, highlighting it's voluntary and tax incentive-based. Then, mention the White House's claim and environmentalists' criticism. Next, explain the plan's goal of reducing emission intensity, its reliance on industry goodwill, and Bush's stance on involving developing nations without binding them. Finally, note the environmentalists' skepticism about the plan's effectiveness.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed. Keeping it concise but informative is key.

SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush introduced an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, focusing on voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, rather than binding obligations. The plan aims to lower the intensity of emissions by 18% over a decade, which the Bush administration claims is comparable to Kyoto's targets. Environmentalists criticized the proposal, calling it ineffective and favoring industry interests. Bush also sought to involve developing nations like India and China in reducing emissions, arguing they should not be exempt, while stating the US would not interfere with countries ratifying Kyoto. Critics argue the plan lacks enforceability and moves away from international efforts to combat global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
