SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, touted as "the most audacious program in American history" by the White House, places no binding obligations on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists argue that this approach will have little effect on emissions, and that the administration is "sticking to the polluting policies" instead of taking "sensible steps" to protect the environment. The plan aims to "slow down and then stop the growth" of harmful gas emissions, but critics argue that it will not "justify" the necessary reductions. The administration claims that the plan will "stabilize" greenhouse gas concentrations while "sustaining" economic growth, but environmentalists see it as a move in the opposite direction from the rest of the international community.
