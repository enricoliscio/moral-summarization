Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. 

First, I should understand the task. They want me to identify morally framed words and then create a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. 

Looking at the article, I need to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "audacious," "voluntary," "binding," "unjust," "counterproductive," "irresponsible," "champion," "opportunity," "sustainable," "protect," "harmful," "weak," "unrealistic," "absolve," "shared," "stabilize," "finance," "investments," "cleaner," "economic growth," "economic development," "progress," "right," "global fight," "opposite direction," "move away," "tax incentives," "encourage," "public spiritedness," "environmental," "taxpayers' money," "cost-effective," "science-based," "shared responsibility," "global community," "binding measures," "voluntarist," "polluters," "unreasonable," "harmful," "weak," "nonexistent," "economic growth," "global warming," "greenhouse gas emissions," "environmental protection," "public health," "economic development," "global fight," "opposite direction," "move away," "tax incentives," "encourage," "public spiritedness," "environmental," "taxpayers' money," "cost-effective," "science-based," "shared responsibility," "global community," "binding measures," "voluntarist," "polluters," "unreasonable," "harmful," "weak," "nonexistent," "economic growth," "global warming," "greenhouse gas emissions," "environmental
