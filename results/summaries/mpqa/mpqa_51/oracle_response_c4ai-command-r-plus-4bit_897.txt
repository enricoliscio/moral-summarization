SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, seeking to slow down global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Bush's plan, described by the White House as "audacious," aims to reduce power station gas emissions but has been criticized by environmentalists as a gift to polluters. The plan moves away from the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected as harmful to the US economy and unfair to industrialized countries. Instead, it relies on the good will of US industrialists, who produce 36% of greenhouse gases from industrialized nations. The objectives are to slow and stop the growth of harmful gas emissions and potentially lower them, targeting a reduction in emission intensity of 18% over ten years. Bush also calls for developing countries like India and China to reduce their emissions, recognizing their right to economic development while asserting that it would be unjust to condemn them to weak growth through unrealistic targets. Environmentalists have attacked the plan, arguing that polluters will not voluntarily become reasonable and that the administration is sticking to polluting policies. They believe the plan will have little effect on emissions and that the US is moving in the wrong direction compared to the rest of the international community. The Bush administration, however, defends its approach, stating it will stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth needed for investments in cleaner energy.
