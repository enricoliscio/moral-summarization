SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, touted by the White House as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, imposing no obligations on industrialists. Environmentalists argue that this approach will have little effect on emissions, and that the plan is "sticking to the polluting policies" that harm the environment. The plan aims to slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, but does not insist on reducing them. Instead, it recognizes the right to economic development and asks developing countries like India and China to take action. Critics argue that this approach is irresponsible and will not stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The plan has been met with widespread discontent from environmentalists, who believe it will not protect the environment.
