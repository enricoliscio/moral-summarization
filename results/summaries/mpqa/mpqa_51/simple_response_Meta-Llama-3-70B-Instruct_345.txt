SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been widely criticized by environmentalists. The plan, dubbed "the most audacious program in American history" by the White House, relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. Environmental groups have slammed the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters". The plan's voluntarist approach has been seen as a weak attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions, with critics arguing that it will have little effect on emissions. The Bush Administration has been accused of prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection, and of abandoning its responsibility to lead the global fight against climate change. The plan's lack of binding measures and reliance on tax incentives has been seen as a betrayal of the international community's efforts to combat global warming.
