SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on 14 February, a plan that imposes no obligations on industrialists and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Described by the White House as "audacious," the Bush plan aims to slow down global warming by encouraging a voluntarist approach and linking emission reduction goals to economic growth. Bush also proposes tax incentives to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources.

The plan moves away from the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, which was rejected by Bush in 2001 as harmful to the US economy. Instead, it recognizes the right of developing countries to economic development and calls on India and China to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

However, environmentalists have attacked the proposal, criticizing it as a "gift for polluters." They argue that the plan will have little effect on emissions and that the US is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the international community. The administration, on the other hand, believes its approach will stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth needed for investments in cleaner energy.

END OF SUMMARY.
