SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been deemed a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters" by environmentalists. The plan, touted as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions," places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Critics argue that this approach will have little effect on emissions, with Carl Pope of the Sierra Club stating that the Bush Administration is "sticking to the polluting policies that the energy industry asked for rather than taking the sensible steps that can protect our health." The plan's goals are to "slow down and then stop the growth in the emissions of harmful gases" and to "lower polluting emissions" by 18% over the next 10 years. However, environmentalists believe that this approach is insufficient and that the US should be taking a more proactive role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
