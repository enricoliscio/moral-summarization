Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, I should start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

First, the article talks about Bush presenting an alternative plan on Valentine's Day, which is a bit ironic because environmentalists are not happy. The plan is voluntary with tax incentives, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which has binding measures. Environmentalists are criticizing it as a gift to polluters. That's a strong moral statement against the plan.

I need to highlight the key elements: the voluntary nature, tax incentives, comparison to Kyoto, criticism from environmentalists, Bush's argument about economic growth, and the response from developing countries. Also, the moral framing is important—Bush's plan is seen as weak and favoring industry over the environment.

I should structure the summary to include Bush's proposal, its basis on voluntary measures, the environmentalists' criticism, the economic angle, and the international response. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ending with the summary tokens.

Wait, the user mentioned I should use a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, the summary should not be longer than 200 words. I need to make sure I capture all the essential points without going over.

I think I should start by stating that Bush proposed an alternative plan, then explain it's voluntary and based on incentives. Mention the White House's description and the environmentalists' reactions. Then touch on Bush's arguments about economic growth and the response from developing countries. Finally, note the criticism from environmentalists about the plan's ineffectiveness.

I should make sure the moral angle is clear—Bush's plan is seen as inadequate and favoring industry, which is a key point from the article. Also, the contrast between Bush's approach and the Kyoto Protocol's binding measures is important for the summary.

Let me put this together in a concise way, ensuring each sentence covers a main point without unnecessary details. I'll keep each part brief to stay within the word limit.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include all these elements and maintain the moral framing as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on Valentine's Day, focusing on voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists criticized the proposal, calling it a "gift for polluters," as it lacked the binding obligations of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected in 2001. The new plan aims to reduce the intensity of emissions by 18% over 10 years, linking goals to economic growth. Critics argue it relies on industry goodwill and lacks enforceability. Bush also sought to engage developing nations like India and China, urging them to reduce emissions while opposing strict targets for them. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, condemned the plan as ineffective, asserting it prioritizes industry over environmental protection. END OF SUMMARY.
