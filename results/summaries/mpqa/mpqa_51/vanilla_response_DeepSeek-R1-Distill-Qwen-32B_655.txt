Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

Okay, the article starts by explaining that Bush presented an alternative plan on February 14th. This plan is a response to the Kyoto Protocol, which the US had rejected before. The key here is that Bush's plan is voluntary, relying on tax incentives and industry goodwill, whereas Kyoto had binding obligations. Environmentalists are criticizing it, calling it a gift to polluters.

I need to capture the essence of Bush's plan: it's voluntary, uses tax breaks, targets reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years. Also, he's trying to engage developing countries like India and China, but without binding them. The White House claims it's the most ambitious plan, but environmental groups are skeptical, saying it won't make a real difference.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: Bush's plan, its voluntary nature, comparison to Kyoto, the 18% target, tax incentives, criticism from environmentalists, and Bush's stance on developing nations. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise.

Let me make sure I include all the main elements without getting too detailed. Maybe start with the presentation of the plan, its nature, the White House's claims, the environmentalist reactions, and the international aspect with developing countries. That should cover the summary effectively.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, 2002, aimed at slowing global warming. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which imposes binding emission reduction targets, Bush's plan relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives for industries. The White House described it as the "most audacious program in American history" for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, targeting an 18% reduction in emission intensity over 10 years. Environmentalists criticized the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," as it lacks enforceability and depends on industry goodwill. Bush also sought to engage developing nations like India and China, urging them to reduce emissions while opposing the Kyoto Protocol's binding targets. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, dismissed the plan as ineffective, arguing it would fail to significantly reduce emissions. The plan emphasizes economic growth and tax breaks for renewable energy adoption, but critics remain skeptical of its impact. END OF SUMMARY.
