SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, moving away from binding measures to voluntary efforts and tax incentives. While the White House touted the plan as ambitious, environmentalists criticized it as a gift to polluters, with no obligation on industrialists to reduce emissions. The Bush Administration argued that their approach would stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth, but environmentalists like Carl Pope and Philip Clapp argued that it favored the energy industry over public health and would have little effect on emissions. President Bush also asserted that developing countries like India and China should be included in emission reduction efforts, a stance that Greenpeace criticized as moving in the opposite direction of the global community. The plan aimed to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the US economy by 18% over 10 years, but without the binding procedures of the Kyoto Protocol, its effectiveness was questioned. The proposal reflected a voluntarist approach, relying on the goodwill of industrialists, and was met with skepticism and concern by those committed to protecting the environment. END OF SUMMARY.
