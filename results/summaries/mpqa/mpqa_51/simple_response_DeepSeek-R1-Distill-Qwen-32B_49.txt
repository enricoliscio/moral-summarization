Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. They specified that the summary should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, so I need to make sure I capture the tone and the criticisms without adding my own bias.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Bush is presenting a plan that's voluntary, relying on tax incentives instead of binding measures. Environmentalists are critical, calling it a gift to polluters. The plan aims to reduce emissions intensity but not absolute emissions, which is a key point.

I need to highlight the contrast between Bush's approach and the Kyoto Protocol, which was rejected by him. The moral aspect here is the criticism that this plan isn't doing enough, especially compared to other countries. Also, Bush is trying to get developing nations on board, but environmentalists argue that it's not sufficient.

I should structure the summary to include the main elements: the plan's voluntary nature, the criticism from environmentalists, the comparison to Kyoto, and the international response. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by introducing Bush's plan, mention the voluntary measures and tax incentives. Then, note the White House's claims about it being a significant program. Next, include the environmentalists' reactions, their harsh words, and the criticism about the lack of binding measures. Finally, touch on the international angle, how Bush is trying to engage developing countries but environmentalists think it's inadequate.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and each sentence transitions logically. Also, using direct quotes from critics like Carl Pope and Steve Sawyer will emphasize the moral framing. I'll avoid any technical jargon to keep it accessible.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review it to make sure it captures the moral critique and the key details of the plan.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, 2003, focusing on voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, rather than the binding targets of the Kyoto Agreement. Environmentalists criticized the plan as inadequate, with Carl Pope of the Sierra Club calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters." The Bush Administration claimed the plan would reduce the "intensity" of emissions by 18% over 10 years, but critics argued it would not significantly curb emissions or address global warming effectively. The plan relied on industry goodwill and tax breaks, while Bush also urged developing nations like China and India to join efforts, though he criticized the Kyoto Protocol for imposing unrealistic targets on them. Environmentalists accused the plan of prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection, with Steve Sawyer of Greenpeace stating it moved the US "in the opposite direction" of global efforts. The summary highlights the moral critique of the plan's lack of ambition and its alignment with industry interests over climate action.  
END OF SUMMARY.
