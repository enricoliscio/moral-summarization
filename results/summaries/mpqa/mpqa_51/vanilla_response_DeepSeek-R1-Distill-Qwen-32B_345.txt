Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that Bush presented an alternative plan on Valentine's Day, 14th February. This plan is meant to slow down global warming but doesn't impose any obligations on industries. Instead, it's based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The White House calls it the most audacious program in American history for reducing emissions, but environmentalists are critical.

I should note the key points: the plan replaces the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected earlier, saying it was bad for the US economy. The new plan is voluntary, unlike Kyoto's binding measures. It aims to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over 10 years, which the administration says is comparable to Kyoto's targets. However, environmentalists are skeptical, calling it a gift to polluters.

Bush also wants developing countries like India and China to participate, arguing that it's irresponsible not to involve them. He mentions that these countries contribute a lot to emissions. The plan includes tax incentives of $4.6 billion for renewable energy. Environmentalists, like Carl Pope, criticize the plan for not doing enough and relying on voluntary measures, which they don't trust.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bush's plan as an alternative to Kyoto, its voluntary nature, and the tax incentives. Then, I'll note the environmentalists' criticism and Bush's stance on involving developing countries. Finally, I'll include the White House's claims about the plan's effectiveness and the environmentalists' skepticism.

Let me structure this: introduce the plan, its key features, the administration's claims, environmentalist reactions, and Bush's approach to developing nations. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, 2005, aiming to slow global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which imposes binding emission reduction targets, Bush's proposal relies on industry goodwill and economic growth to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years. Environmentalists criticized the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," as it lacks enforceability and fails to address the urgency of climate change. Bush also sought to involve developing nations like India and China, arguing it would be irresponsible not to include them in emission reduction efforts. The plan includes $4.6 billion in tax incentives for renewable energy but faces skepticism from environmental groups, who doubt its effectiveness. The White House claims the plan is the most ambitious in US history for reducing emissions, but critics argue it falls short of meaningful action. END OF SUMMARY.
