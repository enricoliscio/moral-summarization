Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Bush introduced a plan that relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives instead of binding obligations. Environmentalists are criticizing it as ineffective and favoring polluters. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity but doesn't commit to specific emission cuts. It also tries to involve developing countries like China and India, which is seen as a positive step but still criticized.

I should highlight the moral aspects: Bush's plan being seen as a gift to polluters, the lack of binding measures, and the criticism from environmentalists. Also, the contrast between the US approach and the international community's stance on Kyoto is important.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Bush's plan and its basis, then mention the environmentalist criticism. Include the voluntary measures, tax incentives, and the goal of reducing emissions. Then touch on Bush's stance on developing countries. Finally, note the environmentalists' skepticism about the plan's effectiveness.

I should make sure the moral framing is clear, showing the criticism and the lack of strong measures. Avoiding technical jargon and keeping it straightforward. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, focusing on voluntary measures and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, rather than binding obligations. Environmentalists criticized the proposal as a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," arguing it lacks enforceability and fails to address the urgency of global warming. The plan aims to reduce the intensity of emissions by 18% over 10 years, but critics claim it does not sufficiently curb emissions or hold industries accountable. Bush also sought to involve developing nations like China and India, urging them to share responsibility, though environmentalists argued the plan would have minimal impact. The White House framed the proposal as a bold initiative, but critics accused it of prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection, moving the US away from international efforts under the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
