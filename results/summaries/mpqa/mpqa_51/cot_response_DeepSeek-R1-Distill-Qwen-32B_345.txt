Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. They provided an article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The user has two main steps: first, identify all morally framed single words, and second, write a summary preserving those moral terms.

Okay, for the first step, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "audacious," "voluntary," "binding," "unjust," "counterproductive," "irresponsible," "champion," "opportunity," "sustainable," "unrealistic," "weak," "nonexistent," "harmful," "shared," "proactive," "voluntarist," "public spiritedness," "tax incentives," "reduce," "curb," "stop," "diminish," "stabilize," "finance," "investments," "cleaner," "protect," "health," "save," "costs," "binding rules," "impose constraints," "harmful to the US economy," "right to economic development," "shared obligations," "global fight," "greenhouse effect," "international community," "opposite direction," "least ambitious," "weaker than," "inaction," "failure," "global warming," "environmental public spiritedness," "tax incentives," "renewable energy," "economic growth," "right to economic development," "unjust," "counterproductive," "irresponsible," "champion," "opportunity," "sustainable," "unrealistic," "weak," "nonexistent," "harmful," "shared," "proactive," "voluntarist," "public
