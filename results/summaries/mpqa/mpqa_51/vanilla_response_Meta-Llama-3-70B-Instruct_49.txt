SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow down global warming. The plan places no obligations on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. The White House claims it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but environmentalists have attacked the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters." The plan advocates a voluntarist approach, linking greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth, and proposes tax incentives of $4.6 billion for the adoption of renewable energy sources. Bush also called on India and China to reduce their emissions, stating that it would be "irresponsible" not to do so. Environmentalists argue that the plan will have little effect on emissions and that the US is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the international community.
