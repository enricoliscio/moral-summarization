Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. The key elements are that the plan is voluntary, uses tax incentives, and is opposed by environmentalists.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. The list provided includes words like "program," "gift," "slowing," "moves," etc. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too wordy.

I'll start by outlining the main sections: Bush's plan, its voluntary nature, tax incentives, comparison to Kyoto, environmentalist reactions, and the call for developing countries. I need to keep each section concise.

I should make sure to include the moral implications, like the criticism that the plan is a "gift" to polluters and the concern that it doesn't impose real obligations. Also, highlight Bush's argument about not burdening developing countries but still expecting them to reduce emissions.

I'll need to condense each point into a sentence or two, using the moral terms where appropriate. I must stay within 200 words, so I'll be brief but comprehensive.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the author's moral framing without adding any new information or bias.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on 14 February, aiming to slow global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists criticized the proposal, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," as it imposes no obligations on industries. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which was rejected by Bush in 2001, this new plan advocates a voluntarist approach, linking greenhouse gas reduction goals to US economic growth. The Bush Administration claims the plan will lower the intensity of emissions by 18% over 10 years, comparable to Kyoto's targets. However, critics argue that relying on industry goodwill and tax incentives will have little effect on emissions. Bush also called on developing nations like India and China to share the burden, asserting it would be "irresponsible" not to ask them to reduce emissions. Environmentalists, such as Carl Pope of the Sierra Club, accused the administration of "sticking to polluting policies" and failing to take "sensible steps" to protect health and the environment. The plan, they argue, moves in the opposite direction of global efforts to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
