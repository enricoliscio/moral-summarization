SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been widely criticized by environmentalists. The plan, dubbed a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. The White House claims it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over 10 years, but environmental groups argue it will have little impact. The plan has been attacked for prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection and for exempting developing countries from emissions reductions. Critics argue that the plan is a step backward from the Kyoto Protocol, which has been ratified by over 170 countries. The Bush Administration's approach has been labeled as "irresponsible" and "unjust" for failing to hold industrialized countries accountable for their emissions.
