SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, described by the White House as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. Environmentalists argue that this approach will have little effect on emissions and is "irresponsible" for not asking developing countries like India and China to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The plan has been deemed "unjust" and "counterproductive" by environmentalists, who believe it prioritizes economic growth over environmental protection. The Sierra Club director, Carl Pope, accused the Bush Administration of "sticking to the polluting policies that the energy industry asked for rather than taking the sensible steps that can protect our health."
