SUMMARY: On February 14th, US President George W. Bush proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at curbing global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives for industries and consumers. The plan moves away from the binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected in 2001 as harmful to the US economy. Bush's plan sets a target of reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions generated by the US economy by 18% over 10 years, relying on the goodwill of US industrialists who contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. The administration describes the plan as audacious and expects it to save costs compared to binding regulations. However, environmentalists have criticized the plan, arguing that it falls short of the necessary actions to combat global warming effectively. They believe that voluntary measures are insufficient and that the plan favors the energy industry over public health and the environment. Greenpeace asserts that the US is moving in the opposite direction of the international community's efforts with the Kyoto Protocol. Bush, meanwhile, has expressed determination to engage developing countries like India and China in his plan, arguing that binding targets are unjust and hinder economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
