SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush presented his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14th, aiming to reduce global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Bush's plan moves away from the binding measures of the Kyoto Protocol, which was rejected by the US in 2001 as harmful to its economy. The new proposal is based on the good will of US industrialists, who account for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from industrialized countries. Bush's plan sets out to slow and then stop the growth of harmful gas emissions, with the ultimate goal of reducing them if scientific studies justify it. The US President also asserted his determination to include developing countries like India and China in his plan, deeming it unjust and irresponsible to exclude them from shouldering the shared obligations in the fight against global warming. However, environmentalists have criticized the proposal, arguing that it relies on the will of polluters to become reasonable and that it sticks to polluting policies. They believe the plan will have little to no effect on emissions. The Bush administration, on the other hand, defends its approach as a way to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth needed for investments in cleaner energy structures.
