SUMMARY: On February 14th, US President George W. Bush proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at curbing global warming. Unlike the Protocol, Bush's plan imposes no obligations on industries and instead relies on voluntary actions and tax incentives. The plan links greenhouse gas reduction targets to US economic growth and encourages the adoption of renewable energy sources with $4.6 billion in tax incentives. Bush also emphasized the need for developing countries like India and China to reduce their emissions. Environmentalists criticized the plan, arguing that it lacks mandatory measures and falls short of the commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol. They believe that the plan favors the energy industry and will have a negligible impact on emissions reduction. The White House defended the plan as ambitious and cost-effective, but environmentalists remained skeptical about its potential to address global warming effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
