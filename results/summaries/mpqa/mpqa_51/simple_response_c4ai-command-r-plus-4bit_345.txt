SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, a global effort to combat climate change. Bush's plan, criticized by environmentalists as a gift to polluters, relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives instead of binding obligations. The Bush administration argued that their approach would stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth needed to invest in cleaner energy. However, environmentalists strongly criticized the plan, arguing that it lacked the necessary urgency and effectiveness in addressing the global warming crisis. They asserted that voluntary measures were insufficient and that polluters would not suddenly become reasonable. The administration's defense of their plan as the most audacious program in American history was met with skepticism and outrage by those committed to protecting the planet. The Bush plan, they argued, fell far short of what was needed to address the pressing issue of global warming. END OF SUMMARY.
