SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow down global warming. The plan places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists have criticized the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters." The plan proposes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but does not impose binding measures on industrialized countries. Instead, it advocates a voluntarist approach, linking greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth. The plan also proposes tax incentives of $4.6 billion for the adoption of renewable energy sources. President Bush has called on developing countries, such as India and China, to adopt his plan, stating that it would be "unjust" to condemn them to weak economic growth by insisting on unrealistic greenhouse gas reduction targets. Environmentalists have attacked the plan, saying it will have little effect on emissions and is a step backward from the Kyoto Protocol.
