SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has proposed an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow down global warming. The plan, presented on February 14, places no obligation on industrialists and relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives. Environmentalists have criticized the plan, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but does not impose binding measures on industrialized countries. Instead, it links the reduction of emissions to US economic growth and offers tax incentives of $4.6 billion for the adoption of renewable energy sources. The plan has been attacked by environmentalists, who argue that it will have little effect on emissions and is a step backward from the Kyoto Protocol. The White House, however, has described the plan as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions."
