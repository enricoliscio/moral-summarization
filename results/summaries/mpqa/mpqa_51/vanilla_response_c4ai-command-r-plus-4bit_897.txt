SUMMARY: On February 14th, US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at curbing global warming. Unlike the protocol, Bush's plan has no mandatory requirements for industries and is based on voluntary actions and tax incentives. The White House touted the plan as ambitious, expecting to reduce gas emissions intensity by 18% in a decade. However, environmentalists criticized the plan for lacking mandatory measures, with Carl Pope of the Sierra Club calling it a gift for polluters. The plan moves away from the binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected in 2001. Instead, it encourages voluntary actions by linking emission reduction goals to economic growth. Bush also called on developing nations like India and China to reduce emissions, arguing it would be irresponsible to exclude them from shared obligations. Environmentalists were skeptical, believing the plan would have a negligible impact on emissions. They argued that the US was moving away from global efforts to combat climate change embodied in the Kyoto Protocol. 

END OF SUMMARY.
