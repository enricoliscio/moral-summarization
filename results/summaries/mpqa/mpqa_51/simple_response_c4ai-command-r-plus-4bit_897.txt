SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, aiming to curb global warming through voluntary measures and tax incentives. Bush's plan, criticized by environmentalists as a gift to polluters, abandons the binding commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, which Bush rejected in 2001 as detrimental to the US economy. The new proposal sets a goal of reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic growth by 18% over a decade, relying on the goodwill of US industrialists. Bush also intends to persuade developing nations, particularly India and China, to adopt his plan, arguing that binding targets are unjust and hinder economic growth. Environmentalists argue that the plan is ineffective and that the US is shirking its responsibility in the global fight against climate change. The Bush administration defends its plan as a bold move that will stabilize emissions while sustaining economic growth.
