Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, preserving the moral framing used by the author. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should try to include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about Bush presenting an alternative plan on Valentine's Day, which is a bit ironic since environmentalists are not happy. The plan is voluntary with tax incentives, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which has binding measures. Environmentalists criticize it as a gift to polluters. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years, but it's based on voluntary measures, which critics doubt will work.

Bush also wants developing countries like India and China to participate, arguing that it's irresponsible not to involve them. He's trying to position his plan as better than Kyoto, which he rejected before. Environmentalists are upset because they think the plan won't have much effect and that Bush is sticking to industry-friendly policies.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words. I should structure it to include the key points: the alternative plan, its voluntary nature, criticism as a gift to polluters, comparison to Kyoto, Bush's stance on developing countries, and the environmentalists' skepticism.

I need to make sure to include words like "gift," "voluntary," "imposing," "justify," "condemn," "protect," etc. I'll start by introducing the plan, mention it's voluntary, then the criticism, then Bush's arguments, and end with the environmentalists' reaction.

Let me draft the summary step by step. First, the plan's introduction, then the voluntary aspect and incentives. Then, the criticism as a gift to polluters. Next, the comparison to Kyoto and Bush's stance on developing nations. Finally, the environmentalists' skepticism about the plan's effectiveness.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me make sure each sentence includes a moral framing word where possible without forcing it. I'll check the word count as I go.

Wait, the user provided a sample response, so I can use that as a reference to ensure I'm on the right track. The sample includes the key elements and uses the moral words effectively. I need to make sure my summary is similar but in my own words, capturing all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush introduced an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on Valentine's Day, positioning it as a voluntary initiative with tax incentives to slow global warming. Critics, including environmentalists, labeled it a "gift for polluters," as it lacked binding measures. The plan aimed to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over a decade, relying on industry goodwill rather than imposed targets. Bush argued it recognized developing nations' right to economic growth, urging countries like India and China to join, calling it irresponsible not to involve them. Environmentalists doubted its effectiveness, accusing the administration of sticking to industry-friendly policies and failing to protect the environment. The plan, they argued, moved away from global efforts to combat climate change, offering little effect on emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
