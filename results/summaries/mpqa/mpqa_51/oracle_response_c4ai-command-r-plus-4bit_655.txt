SUMMARY: US President George W. Bush unveiled his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, aiming to slow down global warming. This plan, described by the White House as "audacious," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives rather than imposing obligations on industrialists. Mr. Bush proposed to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions, expecting US industrialists to demonstrate environmental responsibility. The plan sets out to "slow and then stop the growth of harmful emissions" and potentially reduce them if scientific studies justify it. The Bush Administration believes this approach will stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations while sustaining economic growth. However, environmentalists strongly criticized the plan, arguing that it falls short of the binding measures in the Kyoto Protocol and that polluters are unlikely to act voluntarily. They accused the administration of sticking to polluting policies instead of taking sensible steps to protect health and the environment. Mr. Bush also called for India and China to act, arguing it would be irresponsible to absolve them from their obligations in the fight against global warming. The proposal sparked discontent among environmentalists who believe it will have little effect on emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
