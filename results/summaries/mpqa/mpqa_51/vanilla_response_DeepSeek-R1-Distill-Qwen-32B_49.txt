Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article talks about Bush presenting an alternative plan on February 14, 2002, as a response to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was rejected by Bush in 2001 because he thought it would harm the US economy. Now, his new plan is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives instead of binding obligations. Environmentalists are criticizing this plan, calling it a gift to polluters.

I should note the key elements: the plan's voluntary nature, the tax incentives, the target of reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years, and the criticism from environmental groups. Also, Bush is trying to get developing countries like India and China to participate, arguing that they should also reduce emissions. The White House claims this is a bold plan, but critics say it won't make a real difference.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Bush's alternative plan, its voluntary approach, and the tax incentives. Then, I'll contrast it with the Kyoto Protocol, which the US rejected. Environmentalists' criticism should be included, along with Bush's efforts to involve developing nations. Finally, I'll touch on the White House's claims versus the critics' doubts about the plan's effectiveness.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. Introduce Bush's plan as an alternative to Kyoto.
2. Explain the voluntary measures and tax incentives.
3. Mention the target reduction and compare to Kyoto.
4. Note the environmentalists' criticism.
5. Discuss Bush's approach to developing countries.
6. Conclude with the White House's claims vs. critics' skepticism.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without going into too much detail. Also, keep it concise to meet the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
US President George W. Bush unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, 2002, aimed at slowing global warming. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which the US rejected in 2001, Bush's proposal relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives rather than binding obligations. The plan seeks to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% over 10 years, a target the Bush Administration claims is comparable to Kyoto's goals. Environmentalists, however, criticized the plan as ineffective, with Carl Pope of the Sierra Club calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters." Bush also sought to involve developing nations like India and China in reducing emissions, arguing that it would be "irresponsible" not to include them. While the White House touted the plan as a bold initiative, critics argued it would have minimal impact on emissions and move the US away from global efforts to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
