SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush has unveiled an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been met with criticism from environmentalists. The plan, dubbed "the most audacious program in American history" by the White House, relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, with no binding obligations on industrialists. Environmental groups have slammed the proposal, calling it a "Valentine's Day gift for polluters." The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% over the next 10 years, but critics argue it lacks teeth and will have little impact on emissions. The proposal has been seen as a move to undermine the Kyoto Protocol, which has been ratified by over 170 countries. Bush's plan has been criticized for prioritizing economic growth over environmental protection, and for failing to hold industrialists accountable for their emissions. Environmentalists argue that the plan is a step backward in the fight against global warming.
