SUMMARY:
US President George W. Bush unveiled his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on February 14, aimed at curbing global warming. Unlike the protocol, this plan imposes no obligations on industrialists and relies on voluntary actions and tax incentives. The Bush administration projects that this approach will reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions relative to economic growth over the next decade. However, environmentalists have criticized the plan, arguing that it lacks the necessary binding measures and that polluters are unlikely to act reasonably without mandatory constraints. They assert that the administration is prioritizing the interests of the energy industry over public health and the environment. The proposal has been described as a gift to polluters, with no expected significant impact on emissions reduction. President Bush has also called for the inclusion of India and China in global efforts, deeming it irresponsible to exclude them from shared obligations in the fight against global warming. The administration defends its plan, stating that it balances economic growth with the long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.
