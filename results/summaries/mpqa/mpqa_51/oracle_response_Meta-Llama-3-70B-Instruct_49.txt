SUMMARY:

US President George W. Bush presented an alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which has been criticized by environmentalists as a "Valentine's Day gift for the polluters." The plan, touted as "the most audacious program in American history," relies on voluntary measures and tax incentives, rather than binding procedures, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists argue that this approach will have little effect, as it relies on the goodwill of industrialists and lacks concrete targets. The plan aims to "slow down and then stop the growth in harmful gas emissions," but critics argue that it will not lead to significant reductions. The Bush Administration claims that the plan will "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere" while sustaining economic growth, but environmentalists see it as a way to "absolve" developing countries from taking action on climate change. The plan has been met with widespread criticism, with many seeing it as a move in the opposite direction from the rest of the international community.
