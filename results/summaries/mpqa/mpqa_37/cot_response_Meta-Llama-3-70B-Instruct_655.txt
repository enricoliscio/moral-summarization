SUMMARY:
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the "important policy measures and initiatives" taken to "promote and protect human rights" in Pakistan. Despite the country's achievements, such as the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women and police and jail reforms, the report states that the government's human rights record "remained poor". The Pakistani government finds this assessment "unacceptable and a gross misstatement of the facts". Instead, they suggest that all states should work together in a spirit of "cooperation and understanding" to address human rights issues. The government feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment and urges a more collaborative approach to promoting and protecting human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
