SUMMARY: 
Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights as inaccurate and unwarranted. It termed the report as reflecting a tendency to pass judgment on other states without acknowledging Pakistan's important initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, a national plan of action for the elimination of child labor, and the creation of a fund for the rehabilitation of working children. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, launched an awareness campaign for human rights, and ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan rejected this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement, feeling constrained to reject the judgmental tendency of some states. It argued that the cause of human rights would be better served by addressing challenges in a spirit of cooperation and understanding.
