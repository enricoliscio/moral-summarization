SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. The government has pointed out several achievements, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of international conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The report's conclusion that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government suggests that instead of judging others, all states should work together to address their own human rights challenges. The moral framing of this response emphasizes the importance of cooperation and understanding in promoting human rights, rather than judgment and criticism.
