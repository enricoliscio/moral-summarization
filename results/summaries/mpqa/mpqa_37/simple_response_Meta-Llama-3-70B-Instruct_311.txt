SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. These initiatives include the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The government argues that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" is a gross misstatement of facts. Instead, the government suggests that all states should work together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The government's rejection of the report reflects a moral stance against hypocrisy and judgmentalism, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and cooperation in promoting human rights.
