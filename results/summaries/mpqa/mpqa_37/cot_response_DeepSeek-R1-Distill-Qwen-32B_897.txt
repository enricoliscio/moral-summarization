Okay, so I need to help this user who is asking for a news summary while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down what they're asking. They provided a news article where Pakistan rejects a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a concise summary.

First, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "rejected," "inaccurate," "unwarranted," "tendency," "judgment," "promote," "protect," "failed," "acknowledge," "important," "initiatives," "amended," "ratified," "signed," "constraint," "unacceptable," "gross misstatement," "cooperation," "understanding," "address," "problems," "cause," "served," "spirit," "better." These words seem to carry the moral weight the author intended.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The key points are Pakistan rejecting the US report, listing their human rights initiatives, and criticizing the US for judging others. I should include all the morally framed words as much as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to show Pakistan's stance, their efforts, and their criticism of the US report. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the essential moral terms.

I should ensure the summary starts with the rejection, mentions the initiatives, and ends with Pakistan's call for cooperation. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate to preserve the original tone and framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
The government of Pakistan rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, women's rights initiatives, police reforms, and child labor policies. Pakistan also amended its citizenship act to allow women to claim nationality for their children and ratified international labor conventions. Despite these measures, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government deemed a "gross misstatement of the facts." Pakistan emphasized the need for cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights challenges, rejecting the tendency of some nations to judge others.
