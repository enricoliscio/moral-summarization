Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They list several initiatives they've taken, like laws for children, women's rights, and international conventions. The key morally framed words are: inaccurate, sit, fails, protect, achieved, ignored, promulgation, amended, enable, remuneration, elimination, labour, respecting, misstatement, protecting.

I need to make sure these words are included. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection, using "inaccurate" and "unwarranted." Then mention that the report failed to acknowledge their efforts, using "fails" and "protect." Highlight their achievements with "achieved" and "ignored." List the initiatives, using "promulgation," "amended," "enable," "elimination," "labour," and "respecting." Conclude by calling the report a "misstatement" and emphasizing their commitment to "protecting" rights.

I should ensure the flow is logical, each sentence connects well, and all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each morally framed word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Pakistan's government rejected the US State Department's human rights report as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted," stating it failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights. The report was criticized for ignoring significant policy measures, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and initiatives to eliminate child labor. Pakistan has also amended the Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified international conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. Despite these achievements, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government called a gross misstatement. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to protecting human rights and urged cooperation among states to address such issues collectively. END OF SUMMARY.
