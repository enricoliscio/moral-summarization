Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The government of Pakistan is rejecting the US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They argue that the report doesn't acknowledge their efforts in promoting human rights.

I should note the key morally framed words the author used: inaccurate, sit, fails, protect, achieved, ignored, promulgation, amended, enable, remuneration, elimination, labour, respecting, misstatement, protecting. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The article mentions several initiatives Pakistan has taken, like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the commission on women's status, police reforms, child labor policies, and amendments to the citizenship act. They also ratified ILO conventions and introduced joint electorates. The US report, however, criticized Pakistan's human rights record, which the government disputes.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Pakistan's rejection of the report, their listed achievements, and their criticism of the report's inaccuracies. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points and moral terms.

Let me start drafting: Pakistan rejects the US report as inaccurate and unwarranted. They mention their initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System, women's commission, police reforms, and child labor policies. They amended the citizenship act and ratified ILO conventions. The report ignores these, leading Pakistan to reject it as a misstatement. They emphasize their efforts to protect and promote human rights, urging international cooperation.

I should make sure to include all the moral terms without making it too wordy. Maybe combine some sentences to keep it concise. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

SUMMARY:  
The government of Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including the achievement of goals set at a 2000 human rights conference. Pakistan has implemented several initiatives, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and the establishment of a commission on women's status. It has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. Despite these measures, the report states Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government calls a "gross misstatement of the facts." Pakistan emphasizes its commitment to protecting human rights and urges international cooperation to address such issues.  
END OF SUMMARY.
