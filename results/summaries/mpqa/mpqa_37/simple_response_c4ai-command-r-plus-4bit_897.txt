SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected a US State Department report on human rights as factually inaccurate and an unwarranted judgment on the country's progress. The Foreign Office spokesman listed several important policy measures and initiatives undertaken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labour. The spokesman also highlighted the introduction of the system of joint electorates, respecting the wishes of minority communities. Despite these significant developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the spokesman termed unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. The Pakistani government asserted that the cause of human rights would be better served by cooperative problem-solving rather than judgmental posturing. Pakistan's rejection of the US report underscores the country's commitment to improving human rights while maintaining sovereignty and self-determination. It also highlights the need for respectful dialogue and cooperation in the international community to effectively address human rights concerns.
