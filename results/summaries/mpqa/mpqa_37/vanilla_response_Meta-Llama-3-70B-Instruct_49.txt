SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government finds unacceptable. Pakistan argues that all states should work together to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The government points out that it has made significant progress in promoting human rights, including the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority communities' wishes. The government feels constrained to reject the report's assessment and urges cooperation among states to promote human rights.
