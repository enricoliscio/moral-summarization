SUMMARY:
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge its "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights. It highlights its achievements, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labour elimination. Despite these developments, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains "poor", which the government finds "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government urges that the cause of human rights would be better served if states address their problems in a spirit of "cooperation and understanding", rather than sitting in judgment over others.
