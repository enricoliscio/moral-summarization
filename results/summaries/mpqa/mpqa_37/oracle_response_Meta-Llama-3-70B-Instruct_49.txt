SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, deeming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims the report fails to acknowledge the important measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, and police and jail reforms. The report ignores the country's achievements, such as the elimination of child labor and the introduction of a system of joint electorates respecting minority communities' wishes. Despite these developments, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which the Pakistani government considers a gross misstatement of facts. The government urges that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states worked together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding to address their human rights challenges.
