SUMMARY: The US State Department's human rights report is rejected by Pakistan as factually inaccurate and an attempt to pass judgment. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, listing several initiatives and policy measures, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and the introduction of joint electorates respecting minority wishes. Despite these advancements, the US report deemed Pakistan's human rights record as poor, which Pakistan strongly refutes. Pakistan emphasizes that the human rights agenda would be better served through cooperative problem-solving rather than judgmental posturing.

END OF SUMMARY.
