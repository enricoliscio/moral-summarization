Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The government of Pakistan is rejecting the US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They list several initiatives they've taken, like the Juvenile Justice System and women's commission. They also mention amendments to citizenship laws and ratifying international conventions. The report, however, criticizes Pakistan's human rights record as poor, which the government strongly disagrees with, emphasizing their efforts and cooperation in promoting rights.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. The list includes words like 'fails','measures', 'initiatives', 'promote', 'protect', 'achieved', 'ignored', etc. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by stating that Pakistan rejected the US report as inaccurate. Then, mention the initiatives they've taken, using words like 'initiatives', 'promote', 'protect', 'achieved'. I should list some key measures, like the Juvenile Justice Ordinance and women's commission. It's important to note that the US report ignored these achievements, so I'll use 'ignored'. Then, highlight their efforts in ratifying conventions and amendments, using terms like 'ratified', 'amended', 'enable'. 

The US report's assessment is called a'misstatement' and 'poor', which Pakistan rejects. I'll make sure to include words like'reject', 'assessment', 'poor'. Finally, emphasize Pakistan's stance on cooperation and mutual respect in addressing human rights issues, using 'cooperation', 'promoting', 'protecting'.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll structure it to cover the main points without going into too much detail. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key morally framed words are included and the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
The government of Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's significant measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and a national plan to eliminate child labor. Pakistan has also amended its Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified key international conventions on human rights. Despite these developments, the report stated that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor," which the government called a gross misstatement. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to addressing human rights challenges through cooperation and understanding, rejecting the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others.  

END OF SUMMARY.
