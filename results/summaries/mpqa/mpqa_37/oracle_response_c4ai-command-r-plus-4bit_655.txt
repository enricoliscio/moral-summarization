SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. According to the Foreign Office spokesman, the report fails to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives undertaken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, introduced joint electorates respecting minority wishes, and launched a mass awareness campaign for human rights and dignity. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor", which the government strongly rejects as a gross misstatement. Pakistan asserts that the cause of human rights would be better served through cooperation and understanding rather than judgment and criticism.
END OF SUMMARY.
