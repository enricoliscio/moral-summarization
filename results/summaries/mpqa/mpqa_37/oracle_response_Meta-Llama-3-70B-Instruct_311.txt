SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the important measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, and police and jail reforms. The report also ignored the country's achievements, such as the elimination of child labor and the introduction of a system of joint electorates respecting the wishes of minority communities. Despite these developments, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which is a gross misstatement of the facts. The government feels constrained to reject the assessment and calls for cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights issues. The cause of human rights would be better served if all states worked together to promote and protect human rights.
