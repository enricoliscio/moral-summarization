SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights. It points out that all goals set at the 2000 human rights conference have been achieved, but were ignored by the report. The government has taken steps such as promulgating the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishing a commission on women's status, and amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children. The report's assessment that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor is deemed a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government urges that the cause of human rights would be better served if states cooperate and address their problems in promoting and protecting human rights, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
