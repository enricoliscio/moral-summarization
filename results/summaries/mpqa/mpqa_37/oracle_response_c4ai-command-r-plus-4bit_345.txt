SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment as a gross misstatement of facts and calls for cooperation and understanding among states in addressing human rights issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
