SUMMARY: The US State Department's human rights report was rejected by the Pakistani government as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report reflected a tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others and failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has taken significant policy measures and initiatives to uphold human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, and introduced the system of joint electorates respecting minority wishes. Despite these achievements, the report inaccurately states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment and believes that cooperation and understanding among states would better serve the cause of human rights. Pakistan feels constrained to reject the report's judgment and calls for a more collaborative approach to address human rights challenges.

END OF SUMMARY.
