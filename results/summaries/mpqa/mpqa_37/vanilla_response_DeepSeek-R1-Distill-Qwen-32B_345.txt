Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Pakistan's response to the US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They mention that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights.

The Foreign Office spokesman's statement lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, a plan to eliminate child labor, and a fund for working children. They also amended the citizenship act to allow women to pass nationality to their children, even if married to foreigners. Plus, they ran a human rights awareness campaign in 2000, ratified some ILO conventions, and signed optional protocols related to children's rights. They introduced joint electorates for minorities.

Despite all this, the US report says Pakistan's human rights record is poor. Pakistan strongly disagrees, calling it a misstatement and rejecting the report's assessment. They believe that cooperation among states is better for addressing human rights issues.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Pakistan's rejection of the report, the initiatives they've taken, and their argument against the report's findings.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with the rejection, then listing the initiatives briefly, and ending with their stance against the report's conclusions. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft that:

"Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it 'factually inaccurate and unwarranted.' The report was criticized for failing to recognize Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and measures to combat child labor. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship law to allow women to pass nationality to their children, ratified ILO conventions on labor rights, and introduced joint electorates for minorities. Despite these initiatives, the report stated Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. The government strongly disagrees, emphasizing its commitment to human rights and urging international cooperation over judgment."

That's 150 words, so I can add more details without exceeding the limit. Maybe include the human rights awareness campaign and the protocols signed.

Revised:

"Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it 'factually inaccurate and unwarranted.' The report was criticized for overlooking Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and initiatives to eliminate child labor. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship law to allow women to pass nationality to their children, ratified ILO conventions on labor rights, and introduced joint electorates for minorities. Additionally, the country launched a human rights awareness campaign and signed optional protocols related to children's rights. Despite these measures, the report stated Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. The government strongly disagrees, emphasizing its commitment to human rights and urging international cooperation over judgment."

Now it's 170 words. I think that covers all the key points without being too lengthy.
