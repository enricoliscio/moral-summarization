SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected a US State Department report on human rights, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge its efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of international conventions on child labor and equal remuneration. The report's conclusion that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor is seen as a gross misstatement of facts. The government argues that all states should work together to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The moral framing of this response emphasizes the importance of cooperation and understanding in promoting human rights, and critiques the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others.
