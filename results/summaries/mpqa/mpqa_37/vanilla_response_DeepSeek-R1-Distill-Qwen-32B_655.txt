Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the government of Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They mention that the report reflects a tendency of some states to judge others. The Foreign Office spokesman's statement is quoted, pointing out that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights.

Then, the article lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, a policy against child labor, and a fund for working children. They also amended the Citizenship Act to allow women to pass nationality to their children. There was a mass awareness campaign in 2000, ratification of ILO conventions, and the signing of optional protocols related to children's rights. Additionally, Pakistan introduced joint electorates to respect minority wishes.

Despite these efforts, the US report says Pakistan's human rights record is poor. Pakistan strongly rejects this, calling it a misstatement and unacceptable. They argue that cooperation among states is better for advancing human rights.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, the reasons given, and list the key initiatives briefly. I'll end with their stance against the report's conclusions and their call for international cooperation.

I should make sure to include all the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to keep the summary concise and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step:

1. Pakistan rejects the US report as inaccurate.
2. The report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's human rights efforts.
3. List the key initiatives briefly.
4. Mention the US report's negative assessment.
5. Pakistan's rejection of that assessment and their stance on international cooperation.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote human rights, such as implementing the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishing a women's status commission, and reforming police and jails. Pakistan has also amended its Citizenship Act to allow women to pass nationality to their children, launched a human rights awareness campaign, ratified ILO conventions on labor rights, and introduced joint electorates for minorities. Despite these measures, the US report criticized Pakistan's human rights record. Pakistan strongly rejects this assessment, calling it a misstatement, and advocates for international cooperation to address human rights issues. END OF SUMMARY.
