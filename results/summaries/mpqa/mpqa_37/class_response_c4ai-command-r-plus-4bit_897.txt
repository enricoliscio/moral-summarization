SUMMARY: The US State Department Report on human rights in Pakistan has been rejected by the Pakistani government as morally reprehensible and factually inaccurate. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights and achieve the goals set at the 2000 human rights conference. These initiatives include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour, and amendment of the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women's rights. The government also introduced the system of joint electorates, respecting the wishes of minority communities. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report inaccurately states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the Pakistani government considers a gross misstatement and an unacceptable judgment by a foreign state. Pakistan asserts that cooperation and understanding among states would better serve the cause of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
