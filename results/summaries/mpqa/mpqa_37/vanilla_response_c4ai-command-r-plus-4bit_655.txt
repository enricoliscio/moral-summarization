SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it factually inaccurate and reflecting a judgmental tendency. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, and police and jail reforms. The government also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the Pakistani government strongly rejected as a gross misstatement. They emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better served through cooperation and understanding rather than judgment.

END OF SUMMARY.
