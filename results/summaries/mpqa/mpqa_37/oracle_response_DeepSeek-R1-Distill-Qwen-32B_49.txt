Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The government of Pakistan is rejecting the US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They list several initiatives they've taken to promote human rights, like laws for juveniles, women's commissions, police reforms, etc. They also mention international agreements they've ratified.

I should identify the morally charged words from the author's list. Words like "fails," "measures," "initiatives," "promote," "protect," "achieved," "ignored," "enlisting," "promulgation," "establishment," "reforms," "plan," "elimination," "rehabilitation," "amended," "enable," "ratified," "remuneration," "signed," "introduced," "respecting," "developments," "remained," "poor," "misstatement," "reject," "assessment," "sit," "judgment," "cooperation," "promoting," "protecting."

I need to incorporate as many of these as possible into a concise summary. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, then list their initiatives using the moral terms. I'll highlight their achievements and the US report's oversight. Finally, I'll conclude with their stance on international cooperation.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the key moral points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first state the rejection, then detail their efforts, criticize the report, and end with their call for cooperation.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary moral framing words. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The government of Pakistan rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's significant measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and a national plan to eliminate child labor. Pakistan has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children, ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor, and introduced joint electorates to respect minority wishes. Despite these developments, the report stated Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor," which the government deemed a gross misstatement. Pakistan emphasized its achievements and rejected the report's assessment, urging international cooperation to address human rights challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
