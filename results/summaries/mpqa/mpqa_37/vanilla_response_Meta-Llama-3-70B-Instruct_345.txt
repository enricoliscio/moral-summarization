SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions. The report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government finds unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. The government suggests that instead of judging others, all states should work together to address human rights issues. Pakistan has made significant progress in human rights, including the introduction of a juvenile justice system, a national policy to eliminate child labor, and a mass awareness campaign for human rights and dignity.
