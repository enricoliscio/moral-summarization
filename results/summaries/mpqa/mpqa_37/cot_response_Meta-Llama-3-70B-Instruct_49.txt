SUMMARY:
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge its "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights. Despite achieving all goals set at the 2000 human rights conference, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains "poor", which is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment, criticizing the tendency of some states to "sit in judgment" over others. Instead, it suggests that the cause of human rights would be "better served" if all states address their problems in a spirit of "cooperation and understanding".
