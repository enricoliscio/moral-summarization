SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The report, according to the government, "fails to acknowledge" the important policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. The government has listed several achievements, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, and police and jail reforms. Additionally, Pakistan has ratified ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour, and introduced a system of joint electorates respecting the wishes of minority communities. Despite these developments, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government deems an "unacceptable" and "gross misstatement of facts". The government urges that all states should cooperate and address human rights issues together, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
