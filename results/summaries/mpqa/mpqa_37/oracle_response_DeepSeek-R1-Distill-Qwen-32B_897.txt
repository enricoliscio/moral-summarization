Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to include as many as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman says the US report is "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They list several initiatives they've taken to promote and protect human rights, like laws for juvenile justice, women's status, police reforms, child labor elimination, and citizenship amendments. They also mention international conventions they've ratified. Despite all this, the US report says Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which Pakistan calls a "gross misstatement."

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words from the author's list. Words like "fails," "measures," "initiatives," "promote," "protect," "achieved," "ignored," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Pakistan's rejection and their list of positive steps, countering the US report's negative assessment.

I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection, then list their initiatives using the moral terms. I'll end by contrasting their achievements with the US report's assessment, emphasizing their rejection of the report's inaccuracies.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all key points. Make sure to use the moral words to frame the summary as the author intended.

SUMMARY:  
The government of Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's significant measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. The report ignored Pakistan's achievements, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and a national plan to eliminate child labor. Pakistan also amended its citizenship act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified key international conventions on human rights. Despite these developments, the report stated that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor," which the government deemed a gross misstatement. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to cooperation and understanding in addressing human rights challenges, rejecting the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others. END OF SUMMARY.
