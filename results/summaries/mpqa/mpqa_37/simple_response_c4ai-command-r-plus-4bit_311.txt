SUMMARY: The government of Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives undertaken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has made considerable progress in upholding human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and introduction of joint electorates respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments, the US report unfairly criticized Pakistan's human rights record as poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment and the notion that some states can sit in judgment over others. Pakistan emphasizes that cooperation and understanding among states are essential for advancing the cause of human rights. Pakistan's stance highlights the importance of recognizing factual information and respecting national sovereignty in human rights assessments.
