SUMMARY:
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the "important" policy measures and initiatives taken to "promote and protect" human rights in Pakistan. The report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross" misstatement of facts. The government highlights its achievements, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions. The government urges that the cause of human rights would be "better" served if states cooperated and understood each other's challenges in promoting and protecting human rights. The Pakistani government feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment and the tendency of some states to "sit in judgment" over others. END OF SUMMARY.
