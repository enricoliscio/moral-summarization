SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected a US State Department human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the country's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to allow Pakistani women married to foreigners to pass on their nationality to their children. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan rejected this assessment and the tendency of some states to pass judgment on others, emphasizing that cooperation and understanding are needed to address human rights challenges.

END OF SUMMARY.
