Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points. 

The article is about Pakistan's response to the US State Department's human rights report. Pakistan has rejected the report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They argue that it doesn't acknowledge their efforts in promoting human rights.

I should note the key initiatives Pakistan mentions. They include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a commission on women's status, police reforms, child labor policies, a citizenship amendment for women, a human rights awareness campaign, ratifying ILO conventions, and introducing joint electorates for minorities.

The US report, however, states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor. Pakistan strongly disagrees, emphasizing their achievements and criticizing the US for judging others.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Pakistan's rejection, their initiatives, and their criticism of the US report. I'll make sure to include all the main points without going into too much detail.

Let me structure the summary to first state Pakistan's rejection, then list their initiatives, and conclude with their criticism of the US's approach. I should keep the language clear and concise to meet the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all essential aspects of the article.

SUMMARY:  
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and measures to combat child labor. Pakistan also highlighted its ratification of ILO conventions on child labor and equal remuneration, as well as a citizenship amendment enabling women to pass nationality to their children. The government condemned the report's assertion that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, calling it a "gross misstatement." Pakistan urged a cooperative approach to addressing human rights issues rather than external judgment.  
END OF SUMMARY.
