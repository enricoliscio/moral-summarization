SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, listing several initiatives and policy measures taken by the government. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan has rejected this assessment and the tendency of some states to pass judgment on others, emphasizing that cooperation and understanding are needed to address human rights issues effectively.
END OF SUMMARY.
