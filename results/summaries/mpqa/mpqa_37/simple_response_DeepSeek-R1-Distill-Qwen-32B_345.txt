Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They list several initiatives they've taken, like laws for children, women's rights, and labor reforms. The US report says their human rights record is poor, but Pakistan strongly disagrees.

I should highlight Pakistan's rejection and the reasons they gave. I need to include the main initiatives they mention to show their efforts. Also, I should note the US report's criticism and Pakistan's response to it.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection, then list the initiatives briefly. Finally, mention the US report's criticism and Pakistan's stance on international cooperation.

Make sure the moral framing is clear: Pakistan is defending its efforts against foreign judgment, emphasizing their progress and the unfairness of the report.

SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report, according to Pakistan, unfairly judges the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights. The government highlighted several initiatives, including reforms in juvenile justice, women's rights, police and jail systems, child labor elimination, and citizenship amendments for women. Pakistan also pointed out its ratification of international labor conventions and its introduction of joint electorates for minority communities. Despite these measures, the US report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as "poor." The government strongly disagreed, emphasizing that such assessments undermine international cooperation and understanding in addressing human rights challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
