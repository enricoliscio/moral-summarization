SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the important measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. Despite achieving all goals set at the 2000 human rights conference, the report ignores these developments. The government has taken steps such as promulgating the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishing a permanent commission on women's status, and introducing police and jail reforms. Additionally, Pakistan has ratified ILO Conventions and signed the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of Child. The government feels that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" is a gross misstatement of facts. Instead of sitting in judgment, the government suggests that all states should cooperate and address their human rights issues in a spirit of understanding.
