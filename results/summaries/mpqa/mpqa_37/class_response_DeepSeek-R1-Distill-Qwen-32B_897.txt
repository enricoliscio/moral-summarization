Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Pakistan's response to the US State Department's human rights report. Pakistan's government is rejecting the report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They argue that the report doesn't acknowledge their efforts in promoting human rights. 

The author uses several morally framed words like "inaccurate," "fails," "protect," "achieved," "ignored," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The key points are:
1. Pakistan rejects the US report as inaccurate.
2. The report is seen as some states judging others.
3. Pakistan lists several initiatives they've taken, such as laws for women, child labor, etc.
4. They feel the report misstates their progress.

I should structure the summary to highlight Pakistan's rejection and their list of achievements, using the moral terms. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all moral words are included without making it too long. I'll make sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Pakistan's government rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report was criticized for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including the promotion of women's status, police reforms, and the elimination of child labor. Pakistan has amended laws to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified international conventions on labor and child rights. Despite these achievements, the report stated Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the government called a "gross misstatement of the facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights through initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and a mass awareness campaign. The government urged cooperation among states to address human rights challenges, rejecting the tendency of some nations to judge others. END OF SUMMARY.
