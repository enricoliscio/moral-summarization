SUMMARY: Pakistan's government has rejected a US State Department report on human rights as factually inaccurate and reflective of a judgmental attitude towards other nations. The Foreign Office spokesman listed several initiatives and policy measures that the report overlooked, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report unfairly stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan's government strongly refuted this assessment, stating that it was unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. They emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better served through international cooperation and understanding rather than judgment and criticism. Pakistan demonstrated its commitment to human rights by taking significant actions and making policy changes to promote and protect the rights of its citizens, especially women, children, and minorities.
