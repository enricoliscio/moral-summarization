SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the important measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, and police and jail reforms. The report ignores the achievements made, such as the elimination of child labor and the establishment of a fund for rehabilitation of working children. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Despite these developments, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which the government rejects as a gross misstatement of the facts. The government calls for cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights issues, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
