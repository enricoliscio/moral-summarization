SUMMARY:
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights as inaccurate and morally unjustified. The report fails to recognize Pakistan's significant efforts to promote and protect human rights, including important initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the elimination of child labor. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act, enabling women to pass on their nationality to their children. Pakistan has ratified and signed multiple international conventions and protocols on human rights. Despite these positive developments, the US report condemns Pakistan's human rights record as poor. Pakistan finds this assessment unacceptable and a gross misstatement. Pakistan rejects the report's judgmental tendency and calls for cooperative understanding to address human rights challenges. Pakistan is constrained to reject the report's assessment and emphasizes its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights.
