SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights. It points out that all goals set at the 2000 human rights conference have been achieved, but were ignored by the report. The government highlights its efforts, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, and police and jail reforms. It also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. The report's assessment that the government's human rights record remained poor is deemed a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government urges that all states should address human rights issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
