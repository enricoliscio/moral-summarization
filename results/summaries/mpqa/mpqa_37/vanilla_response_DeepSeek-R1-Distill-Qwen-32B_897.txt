Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Pakistan's government rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." They argue that the report doesn't acknowledge the efforts Pakistan has made in promoting human rights. 

Looking further, the Foreign Office spokesman's statement lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a commission on women's status, police reforms, a plan to eliminate child labor, and a fund for children. They also amended the Citizenship Act to allow women to pass nationality to their children, even if the father is foreign. Plus, they ran a mass awareness campaign for human rights and ratified some ILO conventions and protocols. 

The US report, however, says Pakistan's human rights record is poor. Pakistan strongly disagrees, calling it a misstatement and rejecting the report's assessment. They believe that cooperation among states is better for addressing human rights issues rather than one country judging another.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include that Pakistan rejected the report as inaccurate, list some key initiatives they've taken, mention the US report's negative assessment, and Pakistan's stance against it. Also, highlight their call for international cooperation.

Let me structure this: Start with the rejection, mention the initiatives briefly, note the US report's criticism, and conclude with Pakistan's response and their stance on cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, includes all key points, and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft.

First sentence: Pakistan rejects the US human rights report as inaccurate. Then list the initiatives in a concise way. Then mention the US report's negative assessment. Finally, Pakistan's response and their call for cooperation.

I think that covers all the main points without going into too much detail. Now, let me write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words.

Pakistan also amended its Citizenship Act to allow women to pass nationality to their children and ratified key ILO conventions. Despite these initiatives, the US report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as poor. Pakistan strongly opposes this assessment, calling it a misstatement, and advocates for international cooperation to address human rights issues rather than unilateral judgment. END OF SUMMARY.
