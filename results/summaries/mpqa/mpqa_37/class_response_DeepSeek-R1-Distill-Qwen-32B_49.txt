Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken, like the Juvenile Justice System, women's commission, police reforms, etc. They also mention legal changes, like amending the citizenship act and ratifying ILO conventions. They argue that the report ignores their progress and is a misstatement.

The user wants a summary that keeps as many of the author's morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: inaccurate, sit, fails, protect, achieved, ignored, promulgation, amended, enable, remuneration, elimination, labour, respecting, misstatement, protecting.

I should make sure to include these words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure the summary: start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, using "inaccurate" and "unwarranted." Mention that the report fails to acknowledge their efforts. List some key initiatives, using words like "promulgation," "amended," "enable," "respecting." Highlight that the report ignores their achievements, leading to a misstatement. Conclude by emphasizing Pakistan's stance on cooperation in human rights.

I need to ensure the flow is logical and all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, checking each morally framed word for inclusion.

SUMMARY: The Pakistani government rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." It criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children. The government also highlighted its achievements, such as ratifying ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor elimination, and introducing joint electorates to respect minority wishes. Despite these measures, the report stated Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the government called a "gross misstatement of the facts." Pakistan emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better served through cooperation and understanding, rejecting the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others. END OF SUMMARY.
