SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government argues that the report fails to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. The report ignores the country's achievements, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor elimination. The government feels that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" is unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Instead of judging others, the government suggests that all states should work together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding to address human rights issues. The report's tendency to sit in judgment over others undermines the cause of human rights.
