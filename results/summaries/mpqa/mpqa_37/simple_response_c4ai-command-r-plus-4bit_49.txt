SUMMARY: Pakistan has categorically rejected the US State Department's human rights report, deeming it factually inaccurate and reflecting a judgmental attitude. The Foreign Office spokesman pointed out several initiatives and policy measures taken by the Pakistani government to promote and protect human rights, which the report failed to acknowledge. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and the introduction of joint electorates respecting minority wishes. Despite these significant developments, the US report unfairly states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor. Pakistan rightfully rejects this assessment and the condescending attitude of certain states that believe they can judge others. The promotion and protection of human rights would be better served by international cooperation and understanding, not unfounded criticism and judgment. Pakistan's rejection of the report underscores its commitment to human rights and its refusal to be unfairly judged by biased assessments. END OF SUMMARY.
