SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The report, according to the government, "fails to acknowledge" the important policy measures and initiatives taken to promote and protect human rights in Pakistan. The government has achieved significant milestones, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, and police and jail reforms. Additionally, Pakistan has amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. The government has also ratified ILO Conventions and signed the Optional Protocols to Convention on the Rights of Child. Despite these developments, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which the government considers a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government urges that all states should address human rights issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
