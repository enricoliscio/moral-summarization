SUMMARY: 
Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as morally unacceptable. The report was deemed factually inaccurate and unwarranted, failing to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. The government highlighted several initiatives, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. It also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to empower women and launched a mass awareness campaign for human rights and dignity. Despite these developments, the US report termed Pakistan's human rights record as poor, which Pakistan rejects as a gross misstatement. Pakistan condemns the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others and believes the cause of human rights would be better served by addressing challenges in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, promoting and protecting human rights together.
END OF SUMMARY.
