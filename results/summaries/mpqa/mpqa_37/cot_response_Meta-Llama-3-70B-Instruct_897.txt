SUMMARY:
The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The report was criticized for failing to acknowledge the government's "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights. The government highlighted its achievements, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions. Despite these developments, the report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained "poor", which the government deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of the facts". The government urged that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states addressed their problems in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
