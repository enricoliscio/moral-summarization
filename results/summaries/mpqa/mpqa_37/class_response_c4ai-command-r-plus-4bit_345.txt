SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report reflected the tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others and failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has taken significant steps to uphold human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women. Important policy measures, such as police and jail reforms and the national policy for the elimination of child labour, have been achieved and ignored by the report. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, and has ratified key ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labour. Despite these developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the government considers a gross misstatement of the facts. Pakistan believes that cooperation and understanding among states would better serve the cause of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
