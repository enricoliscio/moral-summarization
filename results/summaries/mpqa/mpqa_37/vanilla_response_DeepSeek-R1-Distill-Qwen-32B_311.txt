Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed. The user provided an article where the Pakistani government is rejecting a US human rights report. They want a summary of this article, and they specified that it should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read the article to get the main points. The government of Pakistan is dismissing the US report as inaccurate and unwarranted. They list several initiatives they've taken to improve human rights, like the Juvenile Justice System, women's commission, police reforms, and child labor policies. They also mention amending citizenship laws and ratifying international conventions. The US report, however, says Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which Pakistan strongly disagrees with.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by stating that Pakistan rejected the US report, calling it inaccurate. Then, I'll list their main achievements without going into too much detail. I'll mention the specific initiatives they've taken, like the Juvenile Justice Ordinance, women's commission, etc. It's important to note that Pakistan feels the report is biased and that they're highlighting their progress to counter the US claims. Finally, I'll end with their statement about cooperation in addressing human rights issues.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count after drafting to ensure it's under 200. Also, I need to maintain a formal tone as it's a news summary. 

Wait, the user also mentioned using the tokens "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." I need to make sure those are included correctly. I'll structure the summary to start with the rejection, list the initiatives, mention the US report's criticism, and conclude with Pakistan's stance on cooperation. That should cover all the key points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for failing to recognize Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has implemented several initiatives, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a permanent commission on women's status, police reforms, and measures to eliminate child labor. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to allow women of Pakistani descent to claim nationality for their children. Additionally, Pakistan ratified ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labor, and introduced joint electorates for minority communities. Despite these efforts, the report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government called a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized the importance of international cooperation to address human rights challenges rather than unilateral judgments. END OF SUMMARY.
