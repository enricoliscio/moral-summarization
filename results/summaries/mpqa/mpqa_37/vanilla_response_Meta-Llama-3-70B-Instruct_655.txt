SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of several international conventions. The report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government finds unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. The government feels that the report reflects a tendency of some states to judge others, and that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states worked together to address their respective challenges. The government has listed several initiatives it has taken to promote human rights, including a mass awareness campaign and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority communities' wishes.
