SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights and achieve the goals set at a 2000 human rights conference. These initiatives include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children. Despite these achievements, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the spokesman termed as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of the facts. Pakistan feels constrained to reject the assessment and the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others. The spokesman emphasized that cooperation and understanding among states would better serve the cause of human rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
