SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report fails to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the elimination of child labor. The report also ignores Pakistan's ratification of international conventions on equal remuneration and child labor, as well as its introduction of joint electorates respecting minority communities' wishes. Despite these developments, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the government finds unacceptable. The government urges all states to address human rights issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than judging each other.
