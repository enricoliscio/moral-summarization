SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The report was criticized for failing to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, which include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, and police and jail reforms. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Despite these achievements, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which is deemed an unacceptable misstatement of facts. The government urges that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states address their problems in promoting and protecting human rights in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
