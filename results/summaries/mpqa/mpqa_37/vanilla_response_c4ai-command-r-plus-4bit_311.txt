SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it factually inaccurate and reflecting a judgmental tendency. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge Pakistan's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions. Pakistan has also introduced joint electorates respecting minority wishes and amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to benefit women. Despite these developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the Pakistani government considers unacceptable and a gross misstatement. They emphasize that the cause of human rights would be better served through cooperation and understanding rather than judgment.
END OF SUMMARY.
