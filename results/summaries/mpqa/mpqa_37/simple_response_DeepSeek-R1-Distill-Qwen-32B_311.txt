Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report, calling it inaccurate. I should highlight Pakistan's main points: rejecting the report, listing their human rights initiatives, and their stance against external judgment. I'll make sure to mention the specific measures they've taken, like legal reforms and international agreements. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and use the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The government emphasized its efforts to promote human rights, including legal reforms, women's rights initiatives, child labor elimination, and international commitments. It criticized the report for ignoring these achievements and stressed the importance of cooperation rather than external judgment in addressing human rights issues. END OF SUMMARY.
