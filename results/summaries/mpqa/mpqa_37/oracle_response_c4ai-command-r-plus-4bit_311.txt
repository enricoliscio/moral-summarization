SUMMARY: The government of Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. The spokesman enumerated several achievements, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, and introduced joint electorates to respect the wishes of minority communities. Despite these developments and initiatives, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor". Pakistan rejects this assessment and urges states to work together in a spirit of cooperation to address human rights challenges. Pakistan's government feels constrained to reject the report's judgment and calls for mutual understanding in addressing human rights issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
