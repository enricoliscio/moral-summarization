SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report reflects a tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others and fails to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has taken several important policy measures and initiatives to uphold human rights, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women of Pakistani descent to pass on their nationality to their children with foreign fathers. Despite these achievements, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the Pakistani government considers an unacceptable misstatement of the facts. Pakistan believes that cooperation and understanding among states are necessary to better serve the cause of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
