SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman rejected a US State Department human rights report as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also highlighted the amendment to the Pakistan Citizenship Act, which allows Pakistani women married to foreigners to pass on their nationality to their children. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan rejected this assessment and the tendency of some states to judge others, emphasizing that cooperation and understanding are needed to effectively address human rights issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
