SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's recent human rights report, deeming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report failed to recognize Pakistan's significant policy measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives included the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and national policies to eliminate child labor. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to empower women of Pakistani descent to pass on their nationality to their children with foreign fathers. Additionally, Pakistan ratified ILO conventions, signed optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and introduced a joint electorate system respecting minority communities' wishes. Despite these advancements, the US report deemed Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the Pakistani government rejected as unacceptable and a gross misstatement. They criticized the tendency of some states to pass judgment on others and advocated for cooperative problem-solving to better serve human rights. Pakistan's government stands constrained to reject the assessment and upholds its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
