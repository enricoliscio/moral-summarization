Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Pakistan's government rejecting a US human rights report as inaccurate. They're saying the report doesn't reflect the efforts Pakistan has made in promoting human rights. The report was termed as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted," and Pakistan's Foreign Office is pointing out that the US is acting judgmentally.

They list several initiatives Pakistan has taken, like the Juvenile Justice System, women's commission, police reforms, child labor policies, citizenship amendments, and international conventions they've ratified. The government is frustrated that the report didn't acknowledge these efforts and instead criticized their human rights record as poor.

So, the moral framing here is about sovereignty and the right of a country to assess its own progress without external judgment. Pakistan is emphasizing their own efforts and achievements, while criticizing the US for not recognizing their progress.

I need to make sure the summary captures this perspective. It should mention Pakistan's rejection of the report, the specific initiatives they've taken, and their criticism of the US's tendency to judge others. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure this: start by stating Pakistan's rejection, mention the initiatives, and conclude with their criticism of the US report. Make sure to highlight their achievements and the unfairness they perceive in the report.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, the summary should be clear and to the point, sticking to the main points without getting too detailed.

Alright, I think I have a good structure in mind. Let me put it together.

It also noted its ratification of international conventions and a mass awareness campaign on human rights.

Pakistan emphasized the importance of international cooperation in addressing human rights challenges rather than external judgment. 

SUMMARY: Pakistan rejects the US human rights report as inaccurate, citing its achievements in promoting rights through various reforms and initiatives.
