SUMMARY: 
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's Human Rights Report as factually *inaccurate* and *unwarranted*. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report *failed* to acknowledge the *important* policy measures and *initiatives* taken by the Pakistani government to *promote* and *protect* human rights. The statement *recalled* several *initiatives* and achievements, such as the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, *reforms* in police and jail systems, the *national* policy for the *elimination* of child labor, and the *establishment* of a fund for the rehabilitation of working children. Pakistan has also *amended* its citizenship laws to *enable* women to pass on their nationality to their children. 

Additionally, Pakistan *ratified* ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the *elimination* of child labor, *signed* optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and *introduced* a system of joint electorates *respecting* the wishes of minority communities. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record *remained* poor. Pakistan found this *unacceptable* and *constrained* to *reject* the report's *assessment*. The statement also criticized the *tendency* of some states to pass *judgment* on others and emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better *served* if all states worked together to *address* the challenges of *promoting* and *protecting* human rights.
