SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected a US State Department report on human rights, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The government claims that the report ignores the significant progress made in promoting and protecting human rights in Pakistan, including the establishment of a permanent commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of international conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The government argues that the report's negative assessment is a "gross misstatement of the facts" and reflects a tendency of some states to judge others without understanding. Instead, the government suggests that all states should work together to address human rights issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding. The report's criticism is seen as unacceptable and unwarranted, and the Pakistani government calls for a more collaborative approach to promoting human rights.
