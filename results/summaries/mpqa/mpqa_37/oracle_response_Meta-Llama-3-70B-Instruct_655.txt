SUMMARY:

The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, terming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted". The report, according to the government, fails to acknowledge the important measures and initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights. The government has achieved significant milestones, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, and police and jail reforms. Additionally, Pakistan has ratified ILO Conventions and signed the Optional Protocols to Convention on the Rights of Child, demonstrating its commitment to human rights. Despite these developments, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the government deems as a gross misstatement of facts. The government rejects the assessment and urges cooperation among states to address human rights issues, rather than sitting in judgment over others.
