SUMMARY: The Pakistani government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office spokesman, Pakistan highlighted several initiatives and measures it has taken to promote and protect human rights, many of which were ignored by the report. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and the signing of optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children, introduced joint electorates respecting minority wishes, and launched a mass awareness campaign for human rights and dignity. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor," which the government strongly rejected as a gross misstatement. Pakistan expressed concern about the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others and emphasized that cooperation and understanding are needed to better serve the cause of human rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
