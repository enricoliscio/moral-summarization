SUMMARY: Pakistan's government has rejected the US State Department's human rights report as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office spokesman, Pakistan highlighted several initiatives and measures it has taken to promote and protect human rights, many of which have been ignored by the report. These include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and elimination of child labour. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children and introduced a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments and achievements, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor", which the government strongly rejects as a gross misstatement. Pakistan urges all states to address human rights challenges through cooperation and understanding rather than sitting in judgment over one another.
END OF SUMMARY.
