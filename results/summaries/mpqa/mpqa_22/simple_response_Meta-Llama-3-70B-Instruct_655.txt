SUMMARY:

In a remarkable achievement, astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, a small trolley, will roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, facilitating work on the station over the next several years. Notably, Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly despite operating in an extremely hostile environment. Its success is a testament to the ingenuity and perseverance of the engineers from the Canadian Space Agency and MD Robotics. The completion of this project marks a significant milestone in the development of the space station, and its potential to support future space exploration is vast.
