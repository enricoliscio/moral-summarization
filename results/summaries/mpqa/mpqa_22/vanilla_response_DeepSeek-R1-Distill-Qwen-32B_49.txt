Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about the first space railway being set up by astronauts from Atlantis. They installed a rail car as part of the S-0 truss, which is a big part of a 120-meter girder. This girder supports solar panels for the space station. The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, can move at 3 cm per second but might not go that fast in the first test. It's designed to move the Canadarm2 around for construction. 

Canadarm2 has been working well, handling the truss and moving astronauts. There was a minor issue with a joint, but Canadian engineers fixed it. The arm was rewired to get power from the new truss. More truss segments and a handcar will be added later.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the main points: the space railway, the truss, the rail car's speed, Canadarm2's role, the minor issue and its resolution, and future additions. Make sure it's clear and concise, ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, installing a rail car as part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss on the International Space Station (ISS). The Mobile Transporter, or rail car, has a top speed of three centimeters per second and will support the Canadarm2 robotic arm, enabling it to move between construction sites. The completed 120-meter girder will support solar panels generating power for the station. During a six-hour spacewalk, astronauts Steve Smith and Rex Walheim released restraints on the rail car. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the ISS, has performed flawlessly, installing the truss and moving astronauts. A minor issue with one of its joints was resolved by Canadian engineers. The arm was rewired to draw power through the new truss. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. END OF SUMMARY.
