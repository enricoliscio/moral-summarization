SUMMARY:

Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of three centimeters per second and will support thousands of square meters of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter rail car will roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment and moving spacewalking astronauts to different work sites. Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area. The 18-metre arm will be rewired to draw power through the S-0 truss, and eight more truss segments will be added on future missions.

END OF SUMMARY.
