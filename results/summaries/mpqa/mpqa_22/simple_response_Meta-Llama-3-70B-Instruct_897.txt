SUMMARY:

In a remarkable achievement, astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, officially known as the rail car, will roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, enabling work to progress on the station over the next several years. Despite operating in an extremely hostile environment, Canadarm2 has performed flawlessly, lifting the truss segment out of the shuttle's cargo bay and attaching it to the station's laboratory module. The Canadian engineers' successful bypassing of a detected anomaly on one of its joints demonstrates the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of challenges. This milestone marks a significant step forward in the development of the space station.
