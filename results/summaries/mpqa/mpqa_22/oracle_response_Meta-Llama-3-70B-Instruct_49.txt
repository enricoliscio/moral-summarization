SUMMARY:

In a remarkable achievement, astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second, but its significance lies in its ability to support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for the space station. The Mobile Transporter, as the rail car is officially known, is designed to roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, showcasing its "flawless" performance in an "extremely hostile environment". Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the arm's ability to overcome an anomaly detected on one of its joints, stating that "problems are bound to occur and are part of the normal course of space activities". The successful operation of Canadarm2 is a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of the engineers involved.
