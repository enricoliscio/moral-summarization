Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, which probably means highlighting the achievements and the teamwork involved. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about astronauts preparing a rail car for the International Space Station, which is part of a larger truss system. The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, is designed to move the Canadarm2 around. The Canadarm2 is a Canadian robotic arm that's been working flawlessly despite some initial issues.

I should include the main facts: the installation by Atlantis astronauts, the purpose of the rail car, the capabilities of Canadarm2, and the mention of Canadian engineers overcoming a problem. Also, the future additions like the handcar and more truss segments are important for showing progress.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most significant details. I'll start with the setup of the space railway, mention the astronauts, the rail car's purpose, and the Canadarm2's role. Then touch on the engineers' success in solving the anomaly and the future plans. 

I should ensure the summary flows well and highlights the achievements without getting too technical. Using terms like "milestone," "flawless performance," and "teamwork" will maintain the positive moral tone.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, marking a milestone in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The Mobile Transporter, a rail car capable of moving at up to three centimeters per second, was installed as part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, which will eventually support a 120-meter girder and thousands of square meters of solar panels. The rail car will allow the Canadarm2, a Canadian robotic arm, to move between construction sites on the ISS. Canadarm2 has performed flawlessly since its installation, despite an earlier anomaly in one of its joints, which was successfully resolved by Canadian engineers. The Mobile Transporter's first test was set to occur, with ground controllers likely testing it at a slow speed. This development highlights the complexity and teamwork behind the ISS's ongoing construction. END OF SUMMARY.
