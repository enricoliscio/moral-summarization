* flawless 
* flawlessly 

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis successfully prepared the first space railway for its initial run. The rail car, attached to the International Space Station, will facilitate the movement of the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites. The highly complex robot, Canada's contribution to the station, has performed flawlessly in its crucial role, including flawlessly lifting and attaching the truss segment to the station's laboratory module. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will have a top speed of three centimetres per second during its first test. The rail system will eventually span over 120 metres, supporting massive solar panels to power the station. The CSA and MD Robotics engineers closely monitored Canadarm2's flawless operations, addressing a joint anomaly ahead of time. The robotic arm was also rewired to draw power from the truss. Future plans include adding eight more truss segments and an astronaut handcar to enhance mobility along the truss.
