SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car is part of the S-0 truss, which will eventually be a 120-metre girder supporting solar panels for the International Space Station. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will be used to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has played a pivotal role in installing the truss segment and moving astronauts to different work sites. The arm is powerful enough to lift entire station modules and is monitored closely by teams of engineers from the Canadian Space Agency and MD Robotics. An anomaly was detected on one of its joints, but Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem. Canadarm2 is described as a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment. Eight more truss segments and a handcar for astronauts will be added to the rail system in future missions.
END OF SUMMARY.
