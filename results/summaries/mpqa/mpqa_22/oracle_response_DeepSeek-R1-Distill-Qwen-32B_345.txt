Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the installation of a space railway on the International Space Station. The main components mentioned are the Canadarm2, the Mobile Transporter rail car, and the S-0 truss. The author highlights the complexity and uniqueness of the Canadarm2, calling it a "unique and highly complex robot" working in a "hostile environment." They also mention that despite some issues, the arm has performed flawlessly, which shows resilience and teamwork.

I need to make sure that in my summary, I include terms like "unique," "complex," "hostile environment," and "flawlessly." These words add a moral dimension by emphasizing the achievements and the overcoming of challenges.

The article also talks about the purpose of the railway, which is to support solar panels and provide power for the station. This shows progress and the importance of international collaboration, especially Canada's contribution with the Canadarm2.

I should structure the summary to highlight the successful installation, the performance of the Canadarm2, and the overcoming of technical issues. I'll mention the speed of the rail car and its role in future missions, emphasizing the smooth operations and the teams' efforts.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main achievements and the positive outcomes without getting too detailed. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to maintain the author's perspective on the significance of the project.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: The first space railway was successfully prepared for its inaugural run by astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis. The Mobile Transporter, a rail car part of the 13-meter S-0 truss, is designed to support the Canadarm2 robotic arm, enabling it to move between construction sites on the International Space Station. Despite its slow speed of three centimeters per second, the rail car is a unique and highly complex robot operating in an extremely hostile environment. Canadarm2 has performed flawlessly, lifting the truss segment and moving astronauts during spacewalks. Engineers overcame an anomaly in one of its joints, showcasing resilience and teamwork. The completed 120-meter girder will support solar panels, providing power for the station. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. The project highlights international collaboration and technological achievements. END OF SUMMARY.
