SUMMARY: Astronauts from the Atlantis space shuttle prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car is part of the S-0 truss, which will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will help move the Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work continues on the International Space Station. The arm, Canada's contribution to the station, has been instrumental in installing the truss segment and moving spacewalking astronauts to different work sites. An anomaly was detected in one of its joints but was successfully bypassed by Canadian engineers. According to Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, the arm has performed flawlessly in its pivotal role. The arm was also rewired to draw power through the truss. Eight more truss segments and a handcar for astronauts will be added in future missions. The completed truss will be over 120 meters long.
END OF SUMMARY.
