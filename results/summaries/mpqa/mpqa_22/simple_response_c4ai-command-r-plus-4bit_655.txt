SUMMARY: The first railway in outer space, a 13-metre-long truss segment, was installed outside the International Space Station by astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, is designed to increase the mobility and efficiency of construction work on the space station. It will enable the Canadian-built Canadarm2 robotic arm to move effortlessly from one construction site to another, contributing to the addition of thousands of square meters of solar panels to the station's power supply. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the flawless performance of Canadarm2 in lifting and attaching the truss segment to the station's laboratory module. Despite an anomaly detected in one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the issue, demonstrating their expertise and quick problem-solving skills. The rail car and robotic arm represent a significant milestone in the multi-national collaboration on the International Space Station, showcasing human ingenuity, technological advancements, and moral dedication to pushing the boundaries of space exploration.
