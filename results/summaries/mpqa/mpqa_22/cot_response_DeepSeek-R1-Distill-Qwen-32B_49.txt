Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those frames. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the installation of a rail system on the International Space Station (ISS) by astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis. The key components mentioned are the Mobile Transporter (the rail car) and the Canadarm2 robotic arm. The article highlights the complexity and success of these installations, mentioning that the Canadarm2 has been performing flawlessly despite some initial issues.

Now, for step one, I need to identify single words that carry a moral framing. These are words that convey approval, disapproval, or have a positive/negative connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out such words.

1. **Unique**: This word is used to describe the Canadarm2, indicating its special or one-of-a-kind nature.
2. **Complex**: Refers to the robot's intricate design, which is a positive attribute.
3. **Hostile**: Describes the environment, which is a negative term but used neutrally here.
4. **Performed**: Neutral, but in context, it's positive as it's about success.
5. **Flawlessly**: Clearly a positive word, showing excellence.
6. **Pivotal**: Important, positive in context.
7. **Contribution**: Positive, indicating a significant effort.
8. **Smoothly**: Positive, indicating things went well.
9. **Anomaly**: Neutral but can imply a problem, so slightly negative.
10. **Bypassed**: Neutral, but in context, it's a solution, so positive.
11. **Powerful**: Positive, highlighting capability.
12. **Rewired**: Neutral, but implies effort and improvement.

Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral frame. Let me reconsider. The key morally framed words are likely "unique," "complex," "hostile," "flawlessly," "flawlessly," "pivotal," "contribution," "smoothly," "anomaly," "bypassed," "powerful," and "rewired." But "hostile" is more descriptive than moral. Maybe "flawlessly" is the strongest positive word, and "anomaly" is a problem, which is negative.

Moving on to the summary. I need to include these morally framed words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main points: the installation of the railway, the role of Canadarm2, its performance, and the future plans.

I'll structure it by first introducing the setup of the space railway, mention the astronauts' work, describe the Mobile Transporter and Canadarm2, their performance, and then touch on future additions like the handcar. I'll make sure to include words like "unique," "complex," "hostile," "flawlessly," "pivotal," "contribution," and "powerful" to preserve the moral framing.

I should ensure the summary flows well and is within the word limit. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary details without being too verbose.

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me check that to see if I'm on the right track. The example includes words like "unique," "complex," "hostile," "flawlessly," "pivotal," "contribution," "smoothly," "anomaly," "bypassed," "powerful," and "rewired." So, I should include these words where relevant.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the morally framed words as identified.

**STEP 1:**
* Unique
* Complex
* Hostile
* Flawlessly
* Pivotal
* Contribution
* Smoothly
* Anomaly
* Bypassed
* Powerful
* Rewired

**SUMMARY:**
Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have set up the first space railway on the International Space Station (ISS), a unique and complex system designed to support future construction. The Mobile Transporter, a rail car, was installed alongside the Canadarm2, a powerful robotic arm built by Canada. Despite an anomaly in one of its joints, the Canadarm2 has flawlessly performed its pivotal role in installing the S-0 truss segment, a key part of the station's girder system. This system will eventually support solar panels generating power for the ISS. The arm also smoothly moved astronauts during spacewalks, showcasing its contribution to the mission. Future enhancements include adding a handcar for easier astronaut movement. The success of these systems highlights the complexity and hostile environment of space activities, with Canadian engineers successfully bypassing issues to ensure smooth operations. END OF SUMMARY.
