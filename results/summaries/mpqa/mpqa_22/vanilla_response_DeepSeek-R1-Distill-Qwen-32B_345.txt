Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Canadarm2 and the space railway. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the first railway in outer space being set up by astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis. They installed a rail car as part of the S-0 truss, which is a big part of a 120-meter girder on the International Space Station. This girder will support solar panels that generate power for the station. 

The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm around the station. Canadarm2 has been working well so far, even though there was a minor issue with one of its joints that was fixed by Canadian engineers. The arm is crucial for installing truss segments and moving astronauts during spacewalks. 

The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, so I should focus on the key points: the installation of the rail car, its purpose, the role of Canadarm2, and the successful operations despite minor issues.

I'll start by mentioning the astronauts preparing the railway, the rail car's specs, its purpose, and the importance of Canadarm2. I'll also note the minor anomaly and its resolution. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll make sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

Let me structure it: introduction of the railway, details about the rail car and its role, the function of Canadarm2, the anomaly and its fix, and the significance of the setup for future missions.

I think that covers the main points without going into too much detail. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first railway in outer space, part of the International Space Station's construction. The rail car, known as the Mobile Transporter, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm across the station's 120-meter girder, supporting solar panels. The rail car, installed during a six-hour spacewalk, has a top speed of three centimeters per second. Canadarm2, a 18-meter robotic arm built by Canada, has performed flawlessly, despite a minor joint issue resolved by engineers. The system will support future truss segments and allow easier movement for astronauts. END OF SUMMARY.
