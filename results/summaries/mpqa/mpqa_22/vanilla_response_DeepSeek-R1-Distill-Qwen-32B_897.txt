Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. They want the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and to include specific tokens at the beginning and end. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about astronauts preparing a rail car for the International Space Station, which is part of a larger truss structure. The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm around. The Canadarm2 has been working well despite some initial issues.

I need to identify the key elements: the installation of the rail car, its purpose, the speed, the truss's role in supporting solar panels, and the performance of Canadarm2. I should also mention the teams involved and the future additions like the handcar.

I'll structure the summary to include these points succinctly. I'll make sure to start with the main event, mention the speed and purpose, then the truss's function, and end with the success of Canadarm2 and future plans. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but informative.

I should also check that I'm using the correct terminology, like Mobile Transporter and Canadarm2, and mention the Canadian Space Agency's role. I'll avoid going into too much detail about the technical issues, just noting that they were resolved.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and covers all the essential information without unnecessary details. I'll start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, installing a rail car outside the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, as it's officially known, is part of a 13-meter-long truss segment and will eventually support a 120-meter girder to hold solar panels for the station. The rail car, with a top speed of three centimeters per second, will move the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites. Canadarm2 has performed flawlessly, despite initial issues, and was used to install the truss and assist astronauts during spacewalks. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. END OF SUMMARY.
