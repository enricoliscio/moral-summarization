Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Hmm, the original text highlights the complexity and success of the project, especially Canada's contribution. I should make sure to include that.

First, I'll identify the main points: the installation of the rail car, its purpose, the speed, the truss segment, the role of Canadarm2, and the anomaly that was fixed. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise.

I should start with the setup of the space railway, mention the astronauts' work, the rail car's specs, and the truss. Then, talk about Canadarm2's flawless performance and the engineers' efforts. Highlighting the success and the international collaboration would fit the moral framing.

Wait, the user also mentioned being a moral expert. Maybe I should emphasize the triumph and teamwork. Let me make sure to include how the anomaly was overcome, showing resilience and expertise. That adds a positive moral angle.

Putting it all together, I'll structure it to flow from the installation to the functionality, then to Canadarm2's role, and conclude with the future plans. Keeping each sentence tight to stay within the word limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Let me draft the summary now, making sure it's clear and hits all the key points while maintaining the positive tone.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, marking a significant step in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The rail car, part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, is designed to support the Canadarm2 robotic arm, enabling it to move along the station's girder. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, has a top speed of three centimeters per second but may not reach full speed during its first test. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the ISS, has performed flawlessly in its role of installing the truss segment and assisting astronauts during spacewalks. Despite a minor anomaly in one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully resolved the issue. The completed girder will support solar panels generating power for the station. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. The project highlights international collaboration and technological innovation in the extreme environment of space. END OF SUMMARY.
