SUMMARY:

In a groundbreaking achievement, the first railway in outer space is ready to roll, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. The rail car, installed outside the International Space Station, will have a top speed of just three centimeters per second, but its impact will be monumental. The Mobile Transporter, as the rail car is officially known, is designed to roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, showcasing the arm's "flawless" performance in its "pivotal" role. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the arm, calling it a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment." Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, demonstrating the arm's reliability. The completed girder will support thousands of square meters of solar panels, generating power for the station. This achievement is a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance in the face of adversity.
