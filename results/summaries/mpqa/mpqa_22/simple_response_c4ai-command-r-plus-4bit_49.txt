SUMMARY: The first space railway in outer space, the Mobile Transporter, was prepared for its inaugural run by astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis. The rail car is part of the S-0 truss, which will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels providing power for the International Space Station. The rail car will enable the Canadarm2 robotic arm, Canada's contribution to the space station, to move from one construction site to another as work progresses. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the arm's flawless performance in installing the truss segment and moving spacewalking astronauts to different work sites. Engineers from the CSA and MD Robotics monitored its work closely and successfully bypassed an anomaly detected in one of its joints. Garneau highlighted the complexity and challenges of operating such a robot in the hostile environment of space, where problems are bound to occur. The completed girder will be 120 meters long, and eight more truss segments will be added in future missions. A handcar will also be included to facilitate astronaut movement along the truss. The successful installation of the rail car and truss segment demonstrates the collaborative efforts and innovative solutions employed by the international teams involved in space station construction.
