SUMMARY:

In a groundbreaking achievement, the first railway in outer space is ready to roll after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second. The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station. Canadarm2, a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment", has performed "flawlessly" in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, demonstrating the robot's reliability. Captain Marc Garneau praised Canadarm2's smooth and flawless operations, acknowledging that "problems are bound to occur and are part of the normal course of space activities". The 18-metre arm, powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired to draw power through the S-0 truss.
