SUMMARY: In a complex and hostile environment, the Canadarm2 robotic arm has flawlessly performed its pivotal role in installing the new truss segment on the International Space Station. Despite detecting an anomaly in one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the issue, ensuring smooth and flawless operations. The powerful robotic arm, unique in its capabilities, lifted the truss segment and attached it to the station's laboratory module. With a top speed of three centimetres per second, the rail car installed outside the station will enhance mobility for the Canadarm2, allowing it to roll from one construction site to another. The arm has been rewired to draw power through the truss and will continue to play a crucial role in future missions as eight more truss segments are added. The rail system will also provide easier mobility for astronauts along the truss, showcasing the collaborative efforts of the Canadian Space Agency and MD Robotics in overcoming challenges and ensuring the success of space activities.
