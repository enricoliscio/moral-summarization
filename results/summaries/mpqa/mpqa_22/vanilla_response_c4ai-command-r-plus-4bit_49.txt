SUMMARY: Astronauts from the Atlantis space shuttle prepared the first outer space railway for its initial run. The rail car is part of the International Space Station's S-0 truss, which will support solar panels generating power for the station. The rail car, officially called the Mobile Transporter, will move the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites as work on the station progresses. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly, according to Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency. The arm was used to lift the truss segment out of the shuttle's cargo bay and attach it to the station's laboratory module. It was also rewired to draw power from the truss. Engineers from the CSA and MD Robotics monitored Canadarm2's performance closely and successfully bypassed an anomaly detected in one of its joints. The rail system will eventually be longer than a football field, with eight more truss segments and a handcar for astronauts to move along the truss. The first test of the rail car is expected to be conducted slowly, with a top speed of three centimetres per second.
