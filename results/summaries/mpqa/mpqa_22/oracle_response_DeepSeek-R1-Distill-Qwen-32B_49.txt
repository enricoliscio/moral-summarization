Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a sample summary, so I should follow that style. First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. 

The article is about the installation of the first space railway on the International Space Station. The Canadarm2 played a crucial role, and it's described as a unique and complex robot. There's mention of astronauts working on the spacewalk, the rail car's speed, and the future additions like the handcar. 

The user mentioned that the author used morally framed words, so I need to ensure those are included. Words like "unique," "complex," "hostile environment," "pivotal role," "flawlessly," "smoothly," and "bound to occur" are important to retain.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the installation of the rail car, its speed, the role of Canadarm2, the performance of the robot, and future plans. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary details.

I should also mention the teams involved, like NASA, CSA, and MD Robotics, and note that any issues are part of normal space activities. The summary should highlight the success and smooth operations despite challenges.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the installation, the role of Canadarm2, its performance, and future plans. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the article's tone.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear, concise, and includes all the key points with the appropriate moral language.

SUMMARY: The first space railway was prepared for its inaugural run after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis completed its installation on the International Space Station. The rail car, part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, will support solar panels generating power for the station. Astronauts Steve Smith and Rex Walheim performed a six-hour spacewalk to release launch restraints on the rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter. Ground controllers may test it at a slow speed of fractions of an inch per second. The Canadarm2 robotic arm, Canada's contribution to the space station, flawlessly installed the truss segment and moved astronauts during the spacewalk. Despite an anomaly in one of its joints, Canadian engineers resolved the issue, showcasing Canadarm2's reliability in the hostile environment of space. The arm was rewired to draw power through the new truss, and future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. The Mobile Transporter's successful setup marks a pivotal step in the station's construction. END OF SUMMARY.
