SUMMARY: 
Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis successfully prepped the first space railway for its initial run, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. The rail car, part of the S-0 truss, will enhance mobility outside the International Space Station. Though designed for a top speed of three centimetres per second, the initial test will be conducted at a slower velocity. The Mobile Transporter will enable the Canadarm2 robotic arm to move effortlessly between construction sites, showcasing its flawless performance in a challenging environment. The arm, powerful enough to lift entire station modules, played a pivotal role in installing the truss segment, demonstrating Canada's invaluable contribution to the multinational space station. Anomalies were detected and adeptly bypassed by Canadian engineers, highlighting the normal challenges of space activities. With eight more truss segments to be added and plans for a handcar, the space railway will support expanding power needs and facilitate astronaut mobility along the 120-metre girder.
