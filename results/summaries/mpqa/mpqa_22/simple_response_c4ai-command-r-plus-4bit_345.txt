SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully installed a rail car system outside the International Space Station, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the space station. The rail car, known as the Mobile Transporter, is part of the S-0 truss, a 120-metre girder that will support solar panels generating power for the station. The Canadian-built Canadarm2 robotic arm played a pivotal role in the installation process, showcasing its reliability and versatility in the hostile environment of space. Despite an anomaly detected in one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the issue, allowing Canadarm2 to continue its flawless performance. With a top speed of three centimetres per second, the rail car will enhance the mobility of the robotic arm, enabling it to move efficiently between construction sites as work progresses on the space station. The successful collaboration between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency highlights the international cooperation and innovative engineering that define the space program. END OF SUMMARY.
