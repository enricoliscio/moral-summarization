SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis successfully prepped the first outer space railway for its initial run. The rail car, part of the S-0 truss, will support the installation of thousands of square meters of solar panels for the International Space Station. During a six-hour spacewalk, astronauts Steve Smith and Rex Walheim released restraints on the Mobile Transporter rail car, designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites. The Canadian Space Agency's president, Captain Marc Garneau, praised the flawless performance of Canadarm2, which played a pivotal role in installing the truss segment. Despite an anomaly detected in one of its joints, Canadian engineers adeptly bypassed the issue, ensuring normal operations. The powerful robotic arm, capable of lifting entire station modules, was also rewired to draw power from the truss. Future missions will see additional truss segments installed, along with a handcar for astronaut mobility. This rail system will significantly enhance the functionality and power generation capabilities of the International Space Station.
