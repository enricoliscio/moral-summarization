SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of three centimeters per second. The truss will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter rail car will roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. The robotic arm lifted the truss segment out of the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it to the station's laboratory module. Engineers monitored its work closely from the ground, successfully bypassing an anomaly detected on one of its joints several weeks ago.

END OF SUMMARY.
