SUMMARY:

In a major milestone, the first railway in outer space is now ready to roll after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepared it for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the International Space Station, will have a top speed of just three centimeters per second, but its significance lies in its ability to support thousands of square meters of solar panels generating power for the station. The Mobile Transporter, as the rail car is officially known, is designed to roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, facilitating work on the station over the next several years. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised Canadarm2's flawless performance, noting that it's a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment." Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, demonstrating the importance of perseverance and adaptability in overcoming challenges in space exploration.
