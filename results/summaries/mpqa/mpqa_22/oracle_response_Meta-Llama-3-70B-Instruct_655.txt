SUMMARY:

In a remarkable achievement, the first railway in outer space is now ready to roll after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second. The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station. The Canadarm2 robotic arm, a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment", has performed "flawlessly" in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, demonstrating the arm's reliability. The arm's operations went "smoothly and flawlessly" yesterday, said Capt. Garneau. The 18-metre arm, powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired to draw power through the S-0 truss.

END OF SUMMARY.
