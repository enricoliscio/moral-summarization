SUMMARY:

Astronauts on the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of three centimeters per second. The truss will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly, lifting the truss segment and moving astronauts to different work sites. Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area. The robotic arm will be used to install eight more truss segments on future missions, and a handcar will be added to the rail system to facilitate astronaut movement.

END OF SUMMARY.
