Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the language used.

The article is about the Canadarm2 and a new rail system on the International Space Station. The author uses words like "unique," "highly complex," "hostile environment," "smoothly," "flawlessly," and "bound to occur." These terms carry a positive and admiring tone towards the technology and the teams involved.

I should start by identifying the main events: the installation of the rail car, the role of Canadarm2, and the performance of the arm despite an anomaly. The moral framing emphasizes the complexity, success, and teamwork.

I need to make sure to include these morally charged words in the summary. Also, I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me outline the points:

1. First space railway ready for testing.
2. Canadarm2's role in installation and support.
3. Smooth performance despite a joint issue.
4. Mention of the hostile environment and the teams' efforts.

Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure to include the key morally framed words and maintain the positive tone.

SUMMARY: The first space railway, a unique and highly complex system, was prepared for its inaugural test after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis completed its installation. The Mobile Transporter, a rail car part of the 13-meter S-0 truss, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm across the space station, supporting future construction. Canadarm2, a pivotal Canadian contribution, has performed flawlessly, despite a minor joint anomaly resolved by engineers. Operating in an extremely hostile environment, Canadarm2 has successfully installed the truss and assisted astronauts during spacewalks. The system, with a top speed of three centimeters per second, marks a significant milestone in space exploration, showcasing the smooth and flawless teamwork of international efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
