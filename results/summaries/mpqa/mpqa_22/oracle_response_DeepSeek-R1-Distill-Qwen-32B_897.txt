Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the language used.

The article talks about the installation of a space railway by astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis. They set up a rail car on the International Space Station, which is part of a larger truss system. The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm around for future construction tasks. The author uses words like "unique," "highly complex," "hostile environment," and mentions that the arm has performed flawlessly despite some initial issues.

I should make sure to include these morally framed terms in the summary. The key points are the setup of the space railway, the role of Canadarm2, its flawless performance, and the future additions like the handcar. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure the summary to include the main achievements, the moral framing words, and the future plans. I'll start with the setup of the railway, mention the truss and solar panels, then talk about Canadarm2's role and performance, and conclude with the future additions. I'll make sure to use words like "unique," "complex," "hostile," and "flawlessly" to maintain the author's tone.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, a rail car capable of moving at three centimeters per second, was installed as part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, which will eventually support a 120-meter girder and thousands of square meters of solar panels. The Canadarm2, a unique and highly complex robot, has flawlessly performed its role in installing the truss and moving astronauts during spacewalks. Despite an anomaly in one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully resolved the issue, demonstrating the arm's resilience in an extremely hostile environment. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar to enhance mobility. The successful deployment highlights the complexity and precision required for space activities. END OF SUMMARY.
