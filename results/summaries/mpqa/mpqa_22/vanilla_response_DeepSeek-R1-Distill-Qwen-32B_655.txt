Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the first space railway being set up by astronauts from the shuttle Atlantis. They installed a rail car as part of the S-0 truss, which is part of a 120-meter girder. This girder supports solar panels for the space station. The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, can move at three cm per second but might not go that fast in the first test.

Canadarm2 is mentioned as a crucial part of this setup. It's a robotic arm built by Canada, used to install the truss and move astronauts. There was a minor issue with one of its joints, but Canadian engineers fixed it. The arm is 18 meters long and can lift entire modules. It's also been rewired to get power from the new truss.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the key points: the installation of the rail car, its purpose, the role of Canadarm2, the minor issue and its resolution, and the future additions like the handcar.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main event, then the components involved, and the significance. Make sure to mention the speed, the truss's role, and the capabilities of Canadarm2.

Let me put it all together, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring it's clear and informative.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, installing a rail car as part of the 13-meter S-0 truss on the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, as the rail car is officially known, is designed to move at a top speed of three centimeters per second, though initial tests may be slower. This rail system will eventually span 120 meters, supporting solar panels to power the station. Canadarm2, a 18-meter robotic arm built by Canada, played a pivotal role in installing the truss and moving astronauts during the spacewalk. Despite a minor joint anomaly, the arm operated flawlessly, demonstrating its capability in the extreme environment of space. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. END OF SUMMARY.
