SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully installed a rail car system outside the International Space Station, marking the first railway in outer space. The rail car, known as the Mobile Transporter, is part of the S-0 truss, which will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels. The Canadian-built Canadarm2 robotic arm played a pivotal role in the installation process, lifting the truss segment out of the shuttle's cargo bay and attaching it to the station's laboratory module. Captain Marc Garneau of the Canadian Space Agency praised the arm's flawless performance in this complex mission, highlighting its unique capabilities in the harsh environment of space. The rail car system will enhance the mobility of the Canadarm2, allowing it to move efficiently between construction sites as work on the station progresses. This collaboration between the CSA and MD Robotics demonstrates the innovative problem-solving and international cooperation that define space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
