SUMMARY:
Astronauts from the Atlantis space shuttle prepared the first railway in outer space for its first run. The rail car, part of the S-0 truss, will support solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. With a top speed of three centimetres per second, the car will transport the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has flawlessly performed complex tasks in the hostile environment of space. An anomaly was detected on one of its joints, but Canadian engineers bypassed the issue, ensuring smooth operations. The arm was rewired to draw power through the truss and will continue to play a pivotal role in future construction by lifting entire station modules. Eight more truss segments will be added to the girder, and a handcar will enhance astronaut mobility along its length.
