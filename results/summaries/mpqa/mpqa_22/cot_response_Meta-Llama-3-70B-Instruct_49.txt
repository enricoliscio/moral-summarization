SUMMARY:
The first railway in outer space is ready to roll after astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second. The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station. Canadarm2, a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment", has performed "flawlessly" in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, and Canadarm2 operations went "smoothly and flawlessly". The robotic arm will be used to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss. With its ability to lift entire station modules, Canadarm2 is a crucial component of the space station's construction.
