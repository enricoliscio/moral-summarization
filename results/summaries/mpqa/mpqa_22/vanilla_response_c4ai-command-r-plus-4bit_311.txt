SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis successfully installed a rail car system outside the International Space Station, marking the first railway in outer space. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will be used to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites as work progresses on the station. The rail car is part of the S-0 truss, a 13-metre-long centerpiece of a planned 120-metre girder that will support solar panels generating power for the station. During a six-hour spacewalk, astronauts Steve Smith and Rex Walheim released launch restraints on the rail car, which has a top speed of three centimeters per second. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, played a pivotal role in installing the truss segment and moving the astronauts to different work sites. An anomaly was detected on one of its joints, but Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the arm's flawless performance in a hostile environment. The arm was also rewired to draw power from the S-0 truss, and future missions will add eight more truss segments and a handcar for astronaut mobility.
