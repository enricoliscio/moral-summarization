Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. They mentioned I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to understand what the moral framing is here. The article talks about the complexity of the robot, the hostile environment, and the successful operations despite potential issues. The moral aspect seems to highlight human ingenuity and teamwork, maybe the triumph of overcoming challenges in space exploration.

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about the first space railway being set up by astronauts from Atlantis. The rail car is part of a truss that will support solar panels. The Canadarm2 is a key part of this, moving the arm around for construction. There was a problem with one of its joints, but Canadian engineers fixed it. The article emphasizes the complexity and success despite the challenges.

So, the summary needs to capture the setup of the space railway, the role of Canadarm2, the problem and its resolution, and the praise for the technology and teamwork. I should make sure to mention the hostile environment and the flawless performance, highlighting the positive outcome.

I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event, then mention the truss and its purpose. Next, describe the Canadarm2's role and the spacewalk. Then, the problem and its solution, and conclude with the praise for the robot and the teamwork.

Let me structure it step by step. First sentence: astronauts prepare the first space railway. Then, the rail car's specs and its part of the truss. Mention the solar panels. Then, the spacewalk details. Next, the Mobile Transporter and its speed. Then, Canadarm2's role and the anomaly fixed. Finally, the success and the future additions.

I should make sure to include the quotes from Capt. Garneau about the robot's complexity and the successful operations. Also, mention the future plans like adding more truss segments and a handcar.

I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll condense each part into concise sentences without losing the key points and the moral tone of human achievement and teamwork in space exploration.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The railway, part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, will support solar panels generating power for the station. During a six-hour spacewalk, astronauts released restraints on the rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, which will move the Canadarm2 robotic arm between construction sites. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the ISS, has performed flawlessly, despite a recent joint anomaly that was resolved by Canadian engineers. The robotic arm, capable of lifting entire station modules, was rewired to draw power through the new truss. The rail car's top speed is three centimeters per second, but initial tests may be slower. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. Capt. Marc Garneau praised Canadarm2 as a "unique and highly complex robot" operating in a hostile environment, highlighting its smooth performance during the recent installation. END OF SUMMARY.
