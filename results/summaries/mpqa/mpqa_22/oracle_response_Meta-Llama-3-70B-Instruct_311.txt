SUMMARY:

In a groundbreaking achievement, astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have successfully prepped the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second, but its significance lies in its ability to support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, or rail car, is designed to roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another, demonstrating "flawless" performance in its "pivotal role" installing the truss segment. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, praised the arm, calling it a "unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment." Despite an anomaly detected on one of its joints, Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area, showcasing the arm's reliability. This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone in the construction of the space station.
