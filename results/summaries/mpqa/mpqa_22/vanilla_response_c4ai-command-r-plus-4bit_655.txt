SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis successfully prepped the first outer space railway for its initial run. The rail car is part of the S-0 truss, which will eventually support thousands of square meters of solar panels for the International Space Station. The rail car, officially known as the Mobile Transporter, will enable the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm to move from one construction site to another as the station is assembled over the next several years. Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the space station, has performed flawlessly thus far, including in the installation of the truss segment. The arm, which is powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired to draw power from the truss. Eight more truss segments and a handcar for astronauts will be added in future missions, enabling more efficient movement along the truss. The first test of the rail car was scheduled for the following day, with a top speed of three centimeters per second. The rail car and truss system are vital for the continued construction and power generation capabilities of the International Space Station.
