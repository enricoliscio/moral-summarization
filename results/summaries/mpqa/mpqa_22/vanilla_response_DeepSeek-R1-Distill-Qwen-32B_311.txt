Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about astronauts from Atlantis preparing the first space railway. They installed a rail car as part of the S-0 truss, which is a big part of a 120-meter girder on the International Space Station. This girder will support solar panels for power. 

The rail car, called the Mobile Transporter, can move at three cm per second but might not go that fast in the first test. It's designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm around the station for future construction. 

Canadarm2 has been working well so far, even after a minor issue was fixed. It's a complex robot built by Canada, and it's crucial for the station's construction. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main elements: the installation of the rail car, its purpose, the speed, the role of Canadarm2, and its performance. 

I should make sure to mention that the rail car is part of a larger structure supporting solar panels, and that future missions will add more parts. Also, the handcar addition for astronauts is a nice detail to include.

Let me structure the summary to start with the installation, then describe the rail car and its speed, followed by the role of Canadarm2 and its flawless performance. Finally, mention the future additions to the system.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, installing a rail car as part of the 13-meter S-0 truss on the International Space Station. The Mobile Transporter, or rail car, is designed to move the Canadarm2 robotic arm across the station's girder, which will eventually span 120 meters and support solar panels generating power for the station. The rail car, capable of a top speed of three centimeters per second, was tested after astronauts released its launch restraints during a six-hour spacewalk. Canadarm2 has performed flawlessly in its role of installing the truss segment and moving astronauts during construction. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. END OF SUMMARY.
