SUMMARY:

Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first railway in outer space for its inaugural run. The rail car, installed outside the International Space Station, will have a top speed of three centimeters per second. The rail car is part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, which will support thousands of square meters of solar panels generating power for the station. The Canadarm2 robotic arm, built by Canada, has performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment and will be used to move the rail car along the truss. The arm has been rewired to draw power through the S-0 truss and will be used to support construction of the station over the next several years. Eight more truss segments will be added on future missions, and a handcar will be added to the rail system to allow astronauts to move more easily along the truss.

END OF SUMMARY.
