Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Canadarm2 and the space railway. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the installation of the first space railway by astronauts from Atlantis. It mentions the Mobile Transporter, which is part of the S-0 truss. The truss is 13 meters long and part of a larger 120-meter girder that will support solar panels. The Canadarm2 is highlighted as a crucial robot built by Canada, performing flawlessly despite some initial issues.

I need to capture the achievements here: the setup of the railway, the role of Canadarm2, and its performance. The moral framing seems to emphasize innovation, international cooperation, and overcoming challenges. So, the summary should highlight these aspects.

I should start with the setup of the railway, mention the Canadarm2's role, its flawless performance, and the significance of international collaboration. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to end with the required tokens.

Let me structure it: mention the astronauts preparing the railway, the purpose of the truss, the role of Canadarm2, its performance, and the international effort. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key points without being too technical.

I think that covers it. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis have prepared the first space railway for its inaugural run, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The Mobile Transporter, a rail car part of the 13-meter S-0 truss, was installed during a six-hour spacewalk and is designed to support the Canadarm2 robotic arm, enabling it to move along the station's girder. The Canadarm2, Canada's contribution to the ISS, has performed flawlessly in its critical role of installing truss segments and moving astronauts during construction. Despite a minor anomaly in one of its joints, Canadian engineers resolved the issue, showcasing the arm's resilience in the harsh space environment. The completed 120-meter girder will support solar panels generating power for the station. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. This achievement highlights international cooperation and technological innovation in space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
