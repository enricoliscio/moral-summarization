Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article they provided. They also want me to identify the morally framed words and include them in the summary. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the Canadarm2 and the space railway setup on the International Space Station. It mentions astronauts preparing the rail car, the speed, the truss segment, and the role of Canadarm2. There's also some technical details about the arm's performance and a minor issue that was fixed.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, emphasizing the significance or success of the project. Words like "unique," "highly complex," "hostile," "flawlessly," "pivotal," "smoothly," and "successfully" stand out. These words highlight the complexity, success, and importance of the project.

Now, for the summary, I should condense the article, keeping the key points: the installation of the railway, the role of Canadarm2, the performance, and the future additions. I need to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's tone. I'll structure it to mention the successful setup, the arm's flawless performance, overcoming challenges, and future plans.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating those key moral terms. Let me piece it together, ensuring all important aspects are covered without being too technical.

**SUMMARY:**  
The first space railway was prepared for operation by astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. The Mobile Transporter, a rail car capable of moving at three centimeters per second, was installed as part of the 13-meter-long S-0 truss, which will eventually support solar panels for the International Space Station. Canadarm2, a highly complex and unique robotic arm, played a pivotal role in installing the truss and moving astronauts during spacewalks. Despite a minor anomaly in one of its joints, Canadarm2 operated flawlessly, showcasing its reliability in the hostile environment of space. Future missions will add more truss segments and a handcar for easier astronaut movement. The successful setup highlights the precision and innovation required for such ambitious projects.
