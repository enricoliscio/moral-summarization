SUMMARY: The United States began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated for the flight, which was guarded by over 40 military police officers. They will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center with cages for 100 detainees, which will be expanded to hold 2,000 prisoners. The airlift comes as the U.S. prepares to send troops to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants and as American bombers continue to target Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld defended the use of strong measures to restrain the prisoners, citing the violent uprisings in Mazar-i-Sharif and Pakistan. Amnesty International criticized the use of sedation and shackles as a violation of international standards. The number of prisoners held by U.S. forces in Afghanistan continues to rise as interviews with prisoners held by anti-Taliban militias continue. END OF SUMMARY.
