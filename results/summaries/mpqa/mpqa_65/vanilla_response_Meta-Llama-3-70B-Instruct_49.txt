SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 prisoners. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 specially trained military police officers on the 20-hour flight. They will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly face trial before military tribunals. The US has stated that the detainees are not considered prisoners of war, but will be afforded Geneva Convention protections. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers, including Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants. Amnesty International has expressed concern over the treatment of prisoners, citing potential violations of international standards.
