SUMMARY: The United States began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners were shackled and hooded, and may have been sedated during the flight, prompting Amnesty International to raise concerns about "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, search crews continued to comb the wreckage of a Marine Corps tanker plane crash that resulted in the death of seven marines. The cause of the accident remains unknown, but Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that there was no evidence of hostile fire. In the Philippines, the United States is preparing to send a force of more than 100 soldiers to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, which is currently holding two American hostages for ransom. The U.S. has also promised to provide the Philippines with a $100 million antiterrorism aid package. In Afghanistan, American bombers continue to target Al Qaeda training camps, as concerns grow about other underground complexes that could become guerrilla bases for Taliban and Al Qaeda forces.
