SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 prisoners. The prisoners, heavily guarded and shackled, will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly face trial before military tribunals. The Pentagon has defended the use of strong measures, citing violent uprisings by prisoners in the past. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers, including Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. The US has also continued to bomb Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, with senior military officials expressing concern about the existence of other underground complexes that could become guerrilla bases.
