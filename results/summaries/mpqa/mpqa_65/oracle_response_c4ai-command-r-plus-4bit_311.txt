SUMMARY: In a crash that took the lives of seven marines, the United States commenced its first airlift of prisoners, transferring heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Despite the Pentagon's defense of their actions, concerns were raised by Amnesty International regarding the potential use of sedation and shackling, which may violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. 

The prisoners will be held at Camp X-Ray, locked in small cages, and possibly face trial before military tribunals. The number of detainees is expected to increase as American forces continue their operations in Afghanistan, with plans to expand the camp to accommodate up to 2,000 prisoners. 

Meanwhile, the United States is preparing to send troops to the Philippines to assist in the fight against Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. The situation is complicated by the group's holding of two American hostages for ransom. 

The article also mentions the capture of John Walker Lindh, an American found among Taliban forces, and the increasing concern over sophisticated underground complexes in Afghanistan that could serve as guerrilla bases for Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. 

In other news, President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness and acknowledging that the enemies of the United States rely on surprise and deception. 

END OF SUMMARY.
