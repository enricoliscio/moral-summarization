SUMMARY: In a cruel and degrading act, the first group of shackled Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in cages and possibly face military tribunals. The Pentagon's decision to sedate and shackle the prisoners has been criticized by Amnesty International as a violation of international standards. Sadly, seven marines died in an accident when their plane crashed in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Pentagon is considering sending Special Operations forces to the Philippines to support Filipino troops in their fight against Muslim militants, with the potential for direct military action. The Philippines is battling Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who are holding two American hostages for ransom. The U.S. has already provided military aid, including weapons and training. The U.S. military also continues to target Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, concerned about the presence of other underground complexes that could harbor remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. Mr. Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill to maintain readiness and counter the deception and surprise tactics of their enemies. END OF SUMMARY.
