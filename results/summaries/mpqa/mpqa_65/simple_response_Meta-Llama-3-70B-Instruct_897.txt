SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, who were heavily guarded and shackled, with some possibly sedated during the 20-hour journey. The prisoners will be held in makeshift detention centers, where they will face intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. The US has defended its treatment of the prisoners, citing concerns about violent uprisings, but human rights groups have raised concerns about the use of shackles and sedation. Meanwhile, the US is also increasing its involvement in the Philippines, where it will send over 100 soldiers to train local troops to fight Muslim militants. The US has also continued to bomb Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, and has signed a $318 billion military spending bill.
