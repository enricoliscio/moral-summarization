SUMMARY: In a cruel and inhuman act, the first group of shackled and hooded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners were airlifted from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be caged in a detention center. Amnesty International condemned the treatment of the prisoners, stating that shackling and sedating them violated international standards. The Pentagon defended their actions, citing the need for strong measures to prevent uprisings. Meanwhile, seven marines died in a fiery aircraft crash in Pakistan, which was not caused by hostile fire, according to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. In a show of support, the U.S. is sending over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants and possibly free American hostages held for ransom. The U.S. is also increasing its military presence in Afghanistan, dropping precision-guided weapons on Al Qaeda targets and expanding its detention facilities to hold up to 2,000 prisoners. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness and vigilance against enemies who rely on surprise and deception.
