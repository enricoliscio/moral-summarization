SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane, with over 40 military police officers guarding them during the more-than-20-hour flight. Pentagon officials defended the use of strong measures, citing violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the past. Amnesty International condemned the treatment, saying it would violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who are holding two American hostages for ransom. The US has also been involved in airstrikes on Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, with concerns that there may be other guerrilla bases in the region.
