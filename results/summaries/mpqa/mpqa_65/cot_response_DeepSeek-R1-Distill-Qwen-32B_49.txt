Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure, so I should follow that closely. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, like "violations," "cruel," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each such word, listing them under STEP 1.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and should capture the main events and the moral implications presented in the article. I'll start by outlining the key points: the airlift of prisoners, the conditions they're being held in, the Pentagon's stance, the criticism from Amnesty International, the expansion of facilities, and the broader context of military actions and spending.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral aspects without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll make sure to mention the use of sedation, shackling, the Geneva Convention, and the criticism from human rights groups. Also, I'll include the Pentagon's justification for their actions, the potential for direct military involvement in the Philippines, and the ongoing military operations in Afghanistan.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but comprehensive. I'll start by stating the main event, then move on to the conditions and criticisms, followed by the broader military context and the budget. I'll end with the moral debate and the administration's stance on their measures.

Let me make sure I'm including all the morally framed words I identified. I'll check each one to see if they fit naturally into the summary. For example, "violations," "cruel," "inhuman," "degrading," "protections," "rights," "prisoners of war," "interrogation," "tribunals," "extended," "network," "aid," "deception," "readiness," "soft," "thinking," and "anxious." I'll weave these into the summary where appropriate to maintain the moral framing.

I should also ensure that the summary is clear and not biased, just presenting the facts with the moral implications as stated in the article. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the information provided.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and that all the key points are covered. I'll also check that the morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the original article's moral perspective.

### SUMMARY:  
The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center. The prisoners, heavily guarded and shackled, were transported on a C-17 plane, with some possibly sedated during the flight. Pentagon officials stated that while the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, they are being afforded protections under the Geneva Convention. However, Amnesty International criticized the treatment, arguing that shackling and sedation violate international standards against "cruel, inhuman, or degrading" treatment. The U.S. military justified the measures, citing past uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners. Meanwhile, the U.S. is expanding its military presence in the Philippines to combat Abu Sayyaf militants linked to Al Qaeda. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need for military readiness and signed a $318 billion defense bill. The U.S. is also targeting Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. The moral debate over the treatment of prisoners and the broader military strategy highlights the administration's focus on counterterrorism and maintaining a strong defense posture. END OF SUMMARY.
