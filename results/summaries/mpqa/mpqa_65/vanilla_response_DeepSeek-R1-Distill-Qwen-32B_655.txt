Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about the U.S. beginning the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, heavily guarded by military police. They were shackled and hooded, and some might have been sedated during the long flight. The Pentagon mentioned they aren't considered prisoners of war but are still protected under the Geneva Convention.

At Guantanamo, they're taken to Camp X-Ray, which is a detention center with concrete and chain-link cages. The camp is being expanded to hold up to 2,000 prisoners. There's also a mention of a plane crash in Pakistan where seven marines died, but it's not due to hostile fire.

Additionally, the U.S. is sending soldiers to the Philippines to train troops against Abu Sayyaf militants, who are linked to Al Qaeda. The article also touches on airstrikes in Afghanistan and President Bush signing a military spending bill.

Amnesty International criticized the treatment of prisoners, saying it violates international standards. The summary should include the main points: the airlift, treatment of prisoners, Camp X-Ray, the plane crash, the Philippines mission, airstrikes, and the spending bill.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with 20 prisoners transported on a C-17 Globemaster. The prisoners were heavily guarded, shackled, and hooded, with some possibly sedated during the flight. They will be held in Camp X-Ray, a detention center with concrete and chain-link cages, pending interrogation and potential trial. The Pentagon clarified that while the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, they receive Geneva Convention protections. Meanwhile, a U.S. Marine Corps tanker crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines, with no evidence of hostile fire. The U.S. is also deploying over 100 soldiers, including Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf militants. Additionally, airstrikes targeted an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, and President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill. END OF SUMMARY.
