SUMMARY: A C-17 Globemaster cargo plane transported 20 shackled and hooded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, marking the first transfer of detainees to the U.S. naval base. The prisoners will be held at Camp X-Ray in 6-by-8-foot cages and interrogated, with the possibility of trial by military tribunals. The U.S. plans to expand the camp to accommodate up to 2,000 prisoners. Meanwhile, search crews continue to investigate the crash of a Marine Corps tanker plane in Pakistan that killed seven marines. The U.S. also announced plans to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to assist in fighting Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group and to provide military aid. American bombers targeted an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan for the sixth time, indicating concern over other underground complexes that could harbor remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness and deterring enemies who rely on surprise and deception. END OF SUMMARY.
