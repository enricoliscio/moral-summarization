Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article discusses the U.S. beginning the airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. It mentions the first flight carrying 20 prisoners, guarded by military police. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated. The Pentagon says they aren't prisoners of war but are under Geneva Convention protections. They'll be held in Camp X-Ray, in cages, awaiting interrogation.

Amnesty International criticizes the treatment as violating international standards. Rumsfeld defends the measures, citing past uprisings. There's also a mention of a Marine plane crash with seven deaths and U.S. involvement in the Philippines against Abu Sayyaf.

The moral framing here seems to focus on the treatment of prisoners and international reactions. The Pentagon's actions are portrayed as necessary for security but questioned by human rights groups. I need to highlight both the U.S. perspective and the criticism.

I should structure the summary to include the airlift details, the conditions, the Pentagon's stance, the criticism from Amnesty, and the broader context of U.S. military actions. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but include all these elements to preserve the moral aspect.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to balance the U.S. justifications with the international concerns about prisoner treatment. I'll also mention the other military operations briefly to provide context without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with 20 prisoners transported under heavy guard. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated during the flight. Pentagon officials stated that while the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, they are afforded Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo Bay, they will be held in Camp X-Ray, confined to small concrete and chain-link cages, awaiting interrogation and potential trial. Amnesty International criticized the treatment as violating international standards against cruel or degrading treatment. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the measures, citing past uprisings by detainees. Meanwhile, the U.S. is preparing to send forces to the Philippines to assist in counterterrorism efforts against Abu Sayyaf militants. The article also notes ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and the signing of a $318 billion military spending bill by President Bush. END OF SUMMARY.
