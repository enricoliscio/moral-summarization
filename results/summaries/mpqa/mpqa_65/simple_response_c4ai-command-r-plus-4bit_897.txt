SUMMARY: The first wave of prisoners transfer from Afghanistan to the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba has begun, with 20 heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners being transported to a makeshift detention center called Camp X-Ray. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane at Kandahar Airport in Afghanistan. The Pentagon has stated that the prisoners are not considered POWs but are still being afforded protections under the Geneva Convention guidelines. Amnesty International has criticized the use of sedatives and shackles during the flight, stating that it would violate international standards. The Pentagon has defended its actions by citing the need for strong measures to prevent violent uprisings. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has also announced that the US is preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops in their fight against Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. The US has also provided military aid and equipment to the Philippines as part of a $100 million antiterrorism package.
