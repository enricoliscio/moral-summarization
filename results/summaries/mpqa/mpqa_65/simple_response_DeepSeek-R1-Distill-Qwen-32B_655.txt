Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with the U.S. beginning the airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon is involved, and they're using a C-17 plane with heavy guards. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated. The Pentagon says they're not prisoners of war but still following Geneva Convention protections. This is a moral point because it's about how they're treating the detainees.

Then, at Guantanamo, they're held in cages, which could be seen as inhumane. Amnesty International criticizes the treatment as violating international standards. That's another moral aspectâ€”critics arguing against the methods used.

There's also mention of the plane crash in Pakistan, but that seems less central to the moral framing. The focus is more on the treatment of prisoners and the expansion of detention facilities.

The summary needs to highlight the U.S. actions, the conditions of detention, the criticism from Amnesty International, and the context of military operations. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral elements are clear.

I'll structure it by first stating the airlift, then the conditions, the Pentagon's stance, the criticism, and the broader military context. I need to ensure it's a summary that captures the key moral points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were transported on a C-17 plane with heavy security, including sedation for the lengthy flight. Pentagon officials stated that while the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, they are being afforded Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo Bay, the prisoners will be confined in small concrete and chain-link cages, awaiting interrogation and potential trial. Amnesty International criticized the treatment, arguing it violates international standards against cruel or degrading treatment. The U.S. military defended its measures, citing past violent uprisings by detainees. Meanwhile, American forces are preparing to assist Philippine troops in combating Abu Sayyaf militants, with potential direct involvement in military actions. The U.S. is also expanding detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay to accommodate up to 2,000 prisoners. END OF SUMMARY.
