Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed news article and wants a summary that includes morally framed words. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a moral connotation, like "prisoners," "detainees," "protections," "cruel," "inhuman," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that has a moral implication.

Next, I need to write a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should reflect the moral aspects discussed in the article, such as the treatment of prisoners, the Geneva Convention protections, and the criticism from Amnesty International.

I'll start by noting the main events: the airlift of prisoners to Guantanamo, the conditions they're held in, the military actions in the Philippines, and the bombing in Afghanistan. I should ensure that the summary highlights the moral issues, like the use of shackles, sedation, and the conditions in Camp X-Ray.

I also need to mention the Pentagon's stance on not considering them prisoners of war but still affording Geneva Convention protections. Including the criticism from Amnesty International adds another moral perspective. 

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, covering the key points without getting too bogged down in details. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive in including the moral elements.

Alright, I think I have a good grasp on how to approach this. Time to draft the summary, making sure to include all the key morally framed words and events.

**STEP 1:**  
* Prisoners  
* Detainees  
* Protections  
* Geneva Convention  
* Cruel  
* Inhuman  
* Degraded  
* Shackled  
* Sedated  
* Interrogation

* Violations  
* Torture  
* Rights  
* Freedoms  

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. began airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 prisoners. The Pentagon emphasized that while the detainees were not classified as prisoners of war, they were afforded protections under the Geneva Convention. However, Amnesty International criticized the use of shackles and sedation during the flight, arguing it violated international standards against cruel and degrading treatment. The prisoners were to be held in Camp X-Ray, where they would face intensive interrogation and potential trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the U.S. was preparing to send forces to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf militants, with possible direct military involvement. In Afghanistan, American forces continued targeting Al Qaeda training camps, while the Pentagon faced criticism over the treatment of detainees and its adherence to international standards. END OF SUMMARY.
