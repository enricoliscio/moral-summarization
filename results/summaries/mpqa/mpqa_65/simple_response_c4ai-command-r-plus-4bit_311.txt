SUMMARY: The first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, took place on January 10, 2002, with a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane carrying 20 shackled and hooded detainees. The Pentagon justified the shackling and hooding of the prisoners, and even the possible use of sedatives during the flight, as necessary measures to prevent violent uprisings, citing incidents in Mazar-i-Sharif and Pakistan. The prisoners were to be held at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, where they would be locked in small cages and subjected to intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. Amnesty International criticized the treatment of the prisoners as a violation of international standards. The airlift took place amidst ongoing military operations in Afghanistan, including the capture of hundreds of prisoners by American forces and the bombing of an Al Qaeda training camp near the Pakistan border. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the use of strong measures to restrain the prisoners and discussed plans for increased American involvement in the Philippines to combat the Abu Sayyaf group, which had ties to Al Qaeda and was holding American hostages.
