SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, who were heavily guarded and restrained with shackles and hoods. The Pentagon defended the use of strong measures, citing past violent uprisings by prisoners. However, Amnesty International condemned the treatment as "cruel, inhuman or degrading". The prisoners will be held in makeshift detention centers, where they will await trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send troops to the Philippines to help train Filipino forces to fight Muslim militants. The move raises concerns about the US's growing involvement in the region and its treatment of detainees.
