Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the U.S. beginning the airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon is moving these prisoners, and there's some concern about their treatmentâ€”like shackling, hoods, and possible sedation. 

I notice that the article mentions the Geneva Convention, which is a moral framework for how prisoners should be treated. The U.S. says they're not prisoners of war but are still protected under the Convention. However, Amnesty International is criticizing the treatment as violating international standards. 

Also, there's mention of Camp X-Ray, where prisoners are kept in small cages, which might raise ethical concerns about their conditions. The user wants the summary to include the moral aspects, so I should highlight the debate over treatment and the Pentagon's justification based on past uprisings.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the airlift began, mention the number of prisoners, their treatment during transport, and the destination. Then, I'll include the Pentagon's stance and the criticism from Amnesty. Also, the mention of possible sedation and the Geneva Convention protections are important. 

I should also touch on the broader context, like the U.S. involvement in the Philippines and military actions in Afghanistan, but keep it concise. The summary should reflect the moral dilemma without getting too detailed. 

Let me structure it: start with the airlift, describe the prisoners' treatment, Pentagon's response, criticism, and the setup at Guantanamo. Then briefly mention other military actions and the funding. Make sure to highlight the ethical concerns and the Pentagon's justification. 

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, showing both the U.S. perspective and the criticism. 

Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, that's about 190 words. I think that covers the main points with the necessary moral elements.

The prisoners will be held in Camp X-Ray, where they will face interrogation and potential trial. Amnesty International criticized the treatment as violating international standards. The U.S. defended its measures, citing past uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners. Additionally, the U.S. is preparing to send troops to the Philippines to assist in counterterrorism efforts against Abu Sayyaf guerrillas linked to Al Qaeda.
