Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the U.S. starting to airlift Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. There's a lot of details here, so I need to pick out the key points.

First, the main event is the first airlift with 20 prisoners. They're being transported on a C-17 plane, heavily guarded. The flight is expected to make a stop before arriving in Cuba. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated. The Pentagon says they're not prisoners of war but are still under Geneva Convention protections.

Then, at Guantanamo, they'll be held in Camp X-Ray, which is a temporary detention center with concrete and chain-link cages. The camp is being expanded to hold up to 2,000 prisoners. There's also mention of the U.S. sending troops to the Philippines to help fight Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, which are linked to Al Qaeda.

Additionally, there's a mention of airstrikes on an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and President Bush signing a military spending bill. The article also touches on a plane crash in Pakistan and some resistance in the Philippines.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the airlift, the conditions, the destination, the military presence in the Philippines, and the airstrikes. I'll make sure to include the key facts without getting bogged down in too many details.

I should also note the criticism from Amnesty International about the treatment of prisoners. And mention that John Walker Lindh wasn't among the transferred prisoners. Also, the mention of the expanding detention facilities and the airstrikes on the training camp.

I'll structure the summary to cover the airlift, the conditions, the destination and facilities, the military actions in the Philippines, and the airstrikes. I'll keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without repeating information.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be under 200 words, so I'll be brief but comprehensive. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the airlift, then the destination, followed by other military actions and airstrikes, and ending with the spending bill.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were transported on a C-17 Globemaster plane, with plans for more than 400 detainees to be held at Guantanamo. They will be housed in a makeshift detention center, Camp X-Ray, where they will face interrogation and possible trial. The Pentagon emphasized that while the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, they will receive Geneva Convention protections. Meanwhile, U.S. forces in the Philippines are preparing to assist Filipino troops in combating Abu Sayyaf militants, with potential direct military involvement. American airstrikes continued targeting Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, amid concerns about other fortified bases. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness against enemies relying on surprise and deception. END OF SUMMARY.
