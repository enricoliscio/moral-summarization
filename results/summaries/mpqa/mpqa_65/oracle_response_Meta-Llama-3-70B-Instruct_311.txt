SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amidst concerns over their treatment. The first flight, carrying 20 prisoners, was heavily guarded and the prisoners were shackled and hooded. Pentagon officials defended the measures, citing violent uprisings by prisoners in the past. However, Amnesty International condemned the treatment as "cruel, inhuman or degrading". The prisoners will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants, with the possibility of becoming involved in direct military action. The move comes as the US increases its military spending, with President Bush signing a $318 billion bill, and continues to bomb Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. The crash of a Marine Corps tanker plane in Pakistan, which killed seven marines, has also raised concerns.
