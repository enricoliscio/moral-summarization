SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 detainees. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 military police officers on the 20-hour flight. They will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly face trial before military tribunals. The US does not consider the detainees prisoners of war, but will afford them Geneva Convention protections. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send 100 soldiers, including Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the use of strong measures to restrain prisoners, citing violent uprisings in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
