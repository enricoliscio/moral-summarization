SUMMARY:
The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 specially trained military police officers on the flight. Amnesty International has criticized the treatment, saying it violates international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the measures, citing violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the past. Meanwhile, the US is also preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. The US has promised the Philippines a $100 million antiterrorism aid package, which includes weapons, training, and shared intelligence. END OF SUMMARY.
