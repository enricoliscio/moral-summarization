Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the U.S. beginning the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. There are details about the flight, the number of guards, the conditions the prisoners are in, and the Pentagon's stance on their treatment. It also mentions the crash of a Marine Corps plane in Pakistan, resulting in deaths, and the U.S. sending forces to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants. Additionally, there's information about ongoing airstrikes in Afghanistan and military spending.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the author's list: crashed, died, accident, cruel, inhuman, degrading, uprisings, came, hostages, ransom, support, clear, become, owe, maintain, readiness, deception.

I'll start by outlining the key events: the airlift, the crash, the Philippines involvement, airstrikes, and military spending. I'll make sure to include the moral terms where appropriate, like "crashed," "died," "accident," and the treatment of prisoners as "cruel," "inhuman," or "degrading."

I should also mention the Pentagon's response to potential uprisings, the hostages in the Philippines, and the U.S. support to the Philippine government. The terms "owe," "maintain," and "readiness" relate to the military spending and preparedness.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll structure it by starting with the airlift, then the crash, followed by the Philippines, airstrikes, and end with military spending.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed without forcing them in. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, with 20 detainees flown from Afghanistan under heavy guard. The Pentagon emphasized that while the prisoners were not classified as prisoners of war, they would receive Geneva Convention protections. However, Amnesty International criticized the use of shackles and sedation during the flight, calling it "cruel, inhuman, or degrading" treatment. The prisoners will be held in Camp X-Ray, where they face interrogation and potential trial. Meanwhile, a Marine Corps tanker plane crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines, with no evidence of hostile fire. The U.S. also prepared to send forces to the Philippines to train counterterrorist units, potentially engaging in direct action against Abu Sayyaf militants. The group holds American hostages for ransom, and U.S. officials aim to "clear" their presence in Basilan. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to "maintain readiness" against enemies using "deception." American airstrikes continued in Afghanistan, targeting Al Qaeda training camps, while President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill to "support" U.S. forces. END OF SUMMARY.
