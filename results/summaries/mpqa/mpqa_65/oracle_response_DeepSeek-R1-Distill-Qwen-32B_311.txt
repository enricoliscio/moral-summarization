Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and identify where the moral terms are used.

The article talks about the U.S. airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. It mentions the conditions they're held in, the use of sedation, shackling, and the Pentagon's stance on their treatment. There are mentions of a plane crash with casualties, the involvement in the Philippines against Abu Sayyaf, and military spending. The moral terms like "crashed," "died," "accident," "cruel," etc., are used to highlight the ethical concerns and the consequences of the actions.

I need to ensure that in the summary, these moral terms are included to maintain the author's framing. I should condense the information, focusing on the key events and the moral implications. I'll start by outlining the main events: the airlift, the crash, the Philippines involvement, and military spending. Then, I'll incorporate the moral words where they fit naturally.

I should also keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll make sure each sentence includes as many relevant details as possible without losing clarity. Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the airlift, then the crash, followed by the Philippines, and ending with the military spending and the moral concerns raised by Amnesty International.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the morally framed words and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and that the moral terms are appropriately placed.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. began airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated during the 20-hour journey. Pentagon officials stated the detainees are not prisoners of war but will receive Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo, they will be held in 6x8-foot cages at Camp X-Ray for interrogation and potential trial. Meanwhile, a Marine Corps tanker plane crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines, though the cause was not attributed to hostile fire. The U.S. also plans to send troops to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf militants, potentially involving direct military action. Amnesty International criticized the treatment of prisoners, stating shackling and sedation violate international standards against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Secretary Rumsfeld defended security measures, citing past uprisings. American forces in Afghanistan held 371 prisoners, with numbers rising as more detainees are interviewed. The U.S. is expanding Guantanamo’s detention facilities to hold up to 2,000 prisoners. Additionally, President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing readiness and countering enemies’ deception. END OF SUMMARY.
