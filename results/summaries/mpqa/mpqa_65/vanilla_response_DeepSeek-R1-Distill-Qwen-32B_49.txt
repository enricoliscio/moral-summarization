Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the U.S. starting the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay. They're using a C-17 plane with 20 prisoners, heavily guarded. The Pentagon didn't give many details, but there are over 40 military police on board. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated during the flight. They're being held at Camp X-Ray, which is a temporary detention center with concrete and chain-link cages. 

Amnesty International is criticizing the treatment as violating international standards. The U.S. doesn't consider them POWs but still follows Geneva Convention protections. The article also mentions other events like a crashed Marine plane in Pakistan, U.S. forces being sent to the Philippines to help fight Abu Sayyaf, and ongoing airstrikes in Afghanistan. Plus, there's mention of military spending and the situation of John Walker Lindh not being transferred yet.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the airlift, the treatment of prisoners, criticism from Amnesty, other military actions, and the context of the Bush administration's policies. I'll make sure to include key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, using a C-17 cargo plane carrying 20 prisoners. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by over 40 military police, with some possibly sedated during the flight. They will be held in Camp X-Ray, a temporary detention center, pending interrogation and potential trial. Amnesty International criticized the treatment as violating international standards. The U.S. does not classify the detainees as prisoners of war but adheres to Geneva Convention protections. Meanwhile, the U.S. is preparing to send forces to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf guerrillas linked to Al Qaeda. American airstrikes continued in Afghanistan, targeting Al Qaeda training camps. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing readiness against enemies using surprise and deception. END OF SUMMARY.
