Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the U.S. beginning the airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. They're using a C-17 plane with heavy guards. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated during the flight. The Pentagon says they're not prisoners of war but are still under Geneva Convention protections.

Then, it mentions the setup at Guantanamo, where they'll be held in cages and interrogated. There's criticism from Amnesty International about the treatment violating international standards. Rumsfeld defends the measures, citing past uprisings.

There's also info about a plane crash in Pakistan with seven marines killed, and the U.S. sending forces to the Philippines to help fight Abu Sayyaf. The U.S. is increasing their military presence there, possibly getting involved directly.

Additionally, there's ongoing bombing in Afghanistan and a military spending bill signed by Bush.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the moral aspects like the treatment of prisoners and international criticism. I'll structure it by first mentioning the airlift, the conditions, the response from the Pentagon and critics, the situation in Pakistan, the Philippines involvement, and the military spending.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all key moral points without getting bogged down in secondary details.
