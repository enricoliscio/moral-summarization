SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, who were heavily guarded and shackled, with some possibly sedated during the 20-hour journey. The prisoners will be held in a makeshift detention center, known as Camp X-Ray, where they will be locked in small cages and subjected to intensive interrogation. Amnesty International has criticized the treatment of the prisoners, saying it violates international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Meanwhile, the US is also increasing its involvement in the Philippines, sending over 100 soldiers to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants. The US has also launched airstrikes on Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, and has signed a $318 billion military spending bill for the 2002 fiscal year.
