SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane, which was expected to make one stop before reaching Cuba. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might be sedated during the flight, sparking concerns from Amnesty International that this would violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment.

Meanwhile, a Marine Corps tanker plane crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines in a fiery accident. The US is also preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who are holding two American hostages for ransom.

The US is expanding its detention center at Guantanamo Bay to hold up to 2,000 prisoners, with Camp X-Ray currently housing 100 detainees. The US has also increased its military spending, with President Bush signing a $318 billion bill, emphasizing the need to maintain a high state of readiness against enemies who rely on "surprise and deception."
