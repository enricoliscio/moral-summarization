SUMMARY: U.S. officials have begun the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners were heavily guarded and shackled during the flight, with their heads covered by hoods. This has raised concerns about the ethical treatment of these individuals, with Amnesty International stating that such practices may violate international standards. The Pentagon has defended its actions, citing the need to prevent violent uprisings. Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the U.S. is preparing to send troops to the Philippines to assist in the fight against Muslim militants, and American forces continue to target Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Afghanistan. This incident highlights the ethical dilemmas that arise during complex military operations, where the balance between security and humane treatment must be carefully navigated. END OF SUMMARY.
