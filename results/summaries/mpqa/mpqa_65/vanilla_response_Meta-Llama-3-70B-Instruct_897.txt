SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, guarded by 40 military police officers, and is expected to make one stop before reaching Cuba. The prisoners were shackled and hooded, and may have been sedated during the 20-hour flight. They will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly face trial before military tribunals. The US has defended its treatment of the prisoners, citing violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the past. Meanwhile, the US is also preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants. Additionally, American forces in Afghanistan are holding a total of 371 prisoners, with the number expected to rise as more prisoners are captured.
