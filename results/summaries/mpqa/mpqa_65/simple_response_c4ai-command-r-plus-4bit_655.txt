SUMMARY: The United States began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated for the flight, prompting criticism from Amnesty International. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced plans to send troops to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants and continued its military operations in Afghanistan, targeting an Al Qaeda training camp near the Pakistan border. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the use of strong measures to restrain the prisoners, citing the potential for violent uprisings. The growing American involvement in the Philippines was also noted, with the possibility of direct military action if requested by the Philippine government. The crash of a Marine Corps tanker plane in Pakistan, which killed seven marines, was attributed to an accident and not hostile fire. END OF SUMMARY.
