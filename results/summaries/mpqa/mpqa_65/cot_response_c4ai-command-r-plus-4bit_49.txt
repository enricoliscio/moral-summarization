SUMMARY:
In a first for the U.S., a cargo plane carried 20 shackled and hooded Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a detention center. Amnesty International criticized the treatment of the prisoners, stating that shackling and sedation violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. This transfer comes amid rising concerns about violent uprisings by prisoners and the discovery of sophisticated underground guerrilla complexes in Afghanistan. The U.S. also plans to send troops to the Philippines to aid in fighting Muslim militants, as they are holding two American hostages for ransom. The U.S. has already provided military aid to the Philippines, including weapons and aircraft. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, American bombers targeted an Al Qaeda training camp for the sixth time, as concerns grow over potential guerrilla bases for Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants. The military spending bill signed by President Bush aims to maintain a high state of readiness, acknowledging that enemies rely on surprise, deception, and the perception of American softness.
