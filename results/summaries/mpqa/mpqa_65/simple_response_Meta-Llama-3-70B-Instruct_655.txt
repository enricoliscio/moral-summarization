SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, who were shackled and hooded, and were guarded by 40 military police officers. The Pentagon claims the prisoners are not POWs, but will be treated according to Geneva Convention guidelines. However, Amnesty International has condemned the use of sedation and shackling as "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. The prisoners will be held in Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will face intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is also preparing to send troops to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants, and has increased its military spending to $318 billion.

The moral framing of this article highlights the controversy surrounding the treatment of prisoners and the potential for human rights abuses. The use of sedation and shackling, as well as the holding of prisoners without trial, raises concerns about the US's commitment to upholding international humanitarian law.
