SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first batch of 20 prisoners arriving on a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 specially trained military police officers during the over 20-hour flight. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might be sedated during the flight, sparking concerns from Amnesty International that such treatment would be "cruel, inhuman or degrading". The prisoners will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will face intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who are holding two American hostages for ransom. The US has also increased its military involvement in Afghanistan, with bombers dropping precision-guided weapons on Al Qaeda training camps.
