SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were loaded onto a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane, accompanied by 40 specially trained military police officers. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might be sedated during the flight, sparking criticism from Amnesty International, which argued that such treatment would be "cruel, inhuman or degrading". The prisoners will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center, where they will undergo intensive interrogation and possibly face trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train local troops to fight Muslim militants, and has pledged $100 million in antiterrorism aid to the country. The move comes as the US continues to combat Al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan, with concerns about guerrilla bases and underground complexes.
