SUMMARY: The first group of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners was transported from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The Pentagon provided limited details about the flight, but it is known that the prisoners were heavily guarded and restrained. Amnesty International raised concerns about potential violations of international standards regarding the treatment of prisoners during transport. Meanwhile, the U.S. is preparing to send troops to the Philippines to assist in fighting Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld mentioned the possibility of a direct American involvement in military action if requested by the Philippine government. Additionally, the U.S. has provided military aid and equipment to the Philippines as part of an anti-terrorism initiative. In Afghanistan, American bombers targeted an Al Qaeda training camp for the sixth time. There are concerns about other underground complexes that could serve as bases for Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for a high state of readiness in the face of unpredictable enemies. END OF SUMMARY.
