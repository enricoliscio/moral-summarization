SUMMARY:
The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 specially trained military police officers during the 20-hour flight. The Pentagon has defended the use of strong measures, citing violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the past. Amnesty International has condemned the treatment of prisoners, saying it violates international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who have been linked to Al Qaeda. The US has also been involved in airstrikes against Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
