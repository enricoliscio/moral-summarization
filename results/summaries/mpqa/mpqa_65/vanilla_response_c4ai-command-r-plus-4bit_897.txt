SUMMARY: On January 10, 2002, the U.S. began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Heavily guarded by military police, the prisoners were shackled and hooded as they boarded a C-17 Globemaster cargo plane. The Pentagon stated that the detainees were not considered prisoners of war but were still given protections under the Geneva Convention. They will be held at Camp X-Ray, a makeshift detention center with cages for intensive interrogation and potential trial before military tribunals. The U.S. is preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to assist in fighting Muslim militants and possibly rescue American hostages. In Afghanistan, American forces continued to target Al Qaeda training camps while also dealing with rising prisoner numbers. The growing American involvement in the Philippines aims to counter the Abu Sayyaf group, linked to Al Qaeda. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness and dispelling notions of American softness. END OF SUMMARY
