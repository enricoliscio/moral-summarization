Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's see what the main points are.

First, the U.S. is starting to airlift prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay. The first flight has 20 prisoners, heavily guarded. They're using a C-17 plane and have military police on board. The prisoners are shackled and hooded, and some might be sedated during the long flight. They're not considered POWs but still get Geneva Convention protections.

At Guantanamo, they'll be held in Camp X-Ray, which is temporary. The camp can hold 100 now, but will expand to 220 soon, and eventually up to 2,000. The U.S. is also sending troops to the Philippines to help fight Abu Sayyaf, which is linked to Al Qaeda. There's mention of military aid to the Philippines, including weapons and training.

There's also info about American forces in Afghanistan holding 371 prisoners, with numbers increasing. Plus, bombers hit an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan again. The Pentagon is concerned about other hidden bases. Lastly, President Bush signed a big military spending bill.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key actions and locations without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the airlift, Guantanamo setup, Philippines involvement, and military spending. Also, note the concerns about prisoner treatment and other bases.
