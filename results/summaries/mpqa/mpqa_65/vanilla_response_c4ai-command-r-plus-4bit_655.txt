SUMMARY: On January 10, 2002, the US began its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they would be held and interrogated. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated for the 20-hour flight, despite protests from Amnesty International. The US denied that these measures were inhumane, citing the need for security. The prisoners would be held in a makeshift detention center called Camp X-Ray, with plans to expand it to hold up to 2,000 prisoners. Meanwhile, the US was also preparing to send troops to the Philippines to assist in fighting Muslim militants and potentially rescue American hostages. In Afghanistan, US forces continued to face resistance, with marines coming under small-arms fire at Kandahar Airport. US bombers targeted an Al Qaeda training camp near the Pakistan border for the sixth time, highlighting concerns about other underground complexes that could harbor Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness and the importance of maintaining a strong military posture.
