SUMMARY:
The United States has begun the transfer of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners were shackled and hooded, and possibly sedated, during the flight, raising concerns from Amnesty International about "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. At Guantanamo Bay, they will be locked in small cages and subjected to intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, American forces continue to detain hundreds of prisoners, including the American John Walker Lindh, who is being held separately. The growing American involvement in the Philippines is also highlighted, with plans to send soldiers to train Filipino troops in their fight against Muslim militants. The article also mentions the crash of a Marine Corps tanker plane in Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of seven marines, and the ongoing bombing of Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasizes the need for readiness and the importance of dispelling the perception of American "softness."
