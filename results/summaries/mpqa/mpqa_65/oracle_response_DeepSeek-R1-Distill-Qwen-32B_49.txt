Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a news summary that preserves the moral framing of the original article. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should end with specific tokens. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about the U.S. starting to airlift prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay. There are details about the flight, the conditions of the prisoners, the Pentagon's stance on their treatment, and some related events like a plane crash and involvement in the Philippines.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words the author used. These include "crashed," "died," "accident," "crash," "cruel," "inhuman," "degrading," "uprisings," "hostages," "ransom," "support," "clear," "owe," "maintain," "readiness," and "deception." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the airlift of prisoners, the conditions they're held in, the Pentagon's response to criticism, the plane crash, and the involvement in the Philippines. I should mention the use of sedatives, shackles, and the Geneva Convention protections. Also, note the crash where marines died and the potential involvement in Abu Sayyaf.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the airlift, then the conditions, Pentagon's defense, the crash, and the Philippines situation. I should also include the moral implications, like the criticism from Amnesty International about cruel treatment and the mention of deception by enemies.

I'll structure the summary to include all these points, making sure to use the specified moral words. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens as specified.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the necessary moral framing. I'll check each point to make sure nothing is missed and that the moral words are appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated during the long journey. Pentagon officials stated the detainees are not prisoners of war but are being held under Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo, they will be detained in small cages at Camp X-Ray, awaiting interrogation and potential trial. Meanwhile, a Marine Corps tanker plane crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines, with no evidence of hostile fire. The U.S. is also preparing to send forces to the Philippines to train troops against Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who are linked to Al Qaeda and hold American hostages for ransom. Critics, including Amnesty International, argue that sedating or shackling prisoners violates international standards against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Pentagon defended its measures, citing past uprisings. American forces in Afghanistan are holding 371 prisoners, with numbers expected to rise. The U.S. is also targeting Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and has increased military spending to maintain readiness against enemies relying on deception. END OF SUMMARY.
