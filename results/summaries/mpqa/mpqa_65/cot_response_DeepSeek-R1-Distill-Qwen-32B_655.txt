Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully. 

First, I'll start by reading the entire article to understand the context. It's about the U.S. airlifting prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, mentioning details about the transportation, treatment of prisoners, and other related military actions.

The user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed. I need to look for words that carry a moral connotation, such as "cruel," "inhuman," "degrading," "protections," "interrogation," "trial," "violations," and "prisoners." These words are key because they highlight the ethical concerns and legal frameworks involved.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I should incorporate as many of the morally framed words as possible to maintain the original article's moral perspective. I'll focus on the main points: the airlift operation, the treatment of prisoners, the response from Amnesty International, the conditions at Guantanamo, and the broader military actions in the Philippines and Afghanistan.

I should structure the summary to include the number of prisoners, their treatment during transit, the Pentagon's stance on their status, the detention facilities, and the criticism from Amnesty International. Additionally, I'll mention the ongoing military operations in other regions to show the comprehensive approach to counterterrorism.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the airlift, moving to the treatment and destination, then the criticism, and finally the broader military strategies. This approach will cover all essential points while emphasizing the moral aspects highlighted in the original text.

I also need to avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and straightforward. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and directly relates to the moral framing identified earlier. 

Lastly, I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key morally framed words are included. This way, the summary accurately reflects the original article's moral perspective while being concise and informative.

### SUMMARY:  
The U.S. began airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with the first flight carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The prisoners were shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated during the 20-hour journey. Pentagon officials stated that while the detainees were not classified as prisoners of war, they would receive Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo, they will be held in Camp X-Ray, where they will face intensive interrogation and potential trial before military tribunals. Amnesty International criticized the treatment, stating that shackling and sedation violate international standards against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The U.S. military also announced plans to send forces to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf militants linked to Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, American bombers targeted Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, amid concerns about other guerrilla bases. The Pentagon emphasized the need for strong measures to prevent uprisings, citing past violent incidents. END OF SUMMARY.
