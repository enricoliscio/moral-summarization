Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. starting to airlift prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay. There's mention of 20 prisoners being transported, guarded by military police, with some possibly sedated. The Pentagon says they're not prisoners of war but are still under Geneva Convention protections. The conditions at Guantanamo, like the cages, are described, which might raise human rights concerns. Amnesty International criticizes the treatment. There's also info about military operations in the Philippines and ongoing airstrikes in Afghanistan. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral aspects, such as the treatment of prisoners and the response from human rights groups. I should include key details like the number of prisoners, the conditions, the Pentagon's stance, and the criticism. Also, mention the broader context like the Philippines involvement and the military spending. Make sure to keep the moral framing intact, showing both the U.S. actions and the criticisms they face.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of 20 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with plans to transfer hundreds more. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 military police during the flight, with some possibly sedated. The Pentagon maintains they are not prisoners of war but will receive Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo, they will be held in 6x8-foot cages at Camp X-Ray for interrogation and potential trial. Amnesty International condemns the treatment as violating international standards against cruel or degrading treatment. The U.S. also plans to send forces to the Philippines to train troops against Abu Sayyaf militants, with possible direct involvement. American airstrikes continue targeting Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, President Bush signed a $318 billion military spending bill. END OF SUMMARY.
