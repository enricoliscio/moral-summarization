SUMMARY: In a tragic accident, seven marines died in a plane crash in southwestern Pakistan, with no evidence of hostile fire being the cause. The United States has begun its first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. Amnesty International has criticized the treatment of these prisoners, stating that shackling them for the entire flight and sedating them would violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. As the U.S. deals with the rising number of prisoners, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has defended the use of strong measures to prevent violent uprisings. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, American forces continue to target sophisticated underground complexes of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, with growing concerns about the possibility of guerrilla bases. The U.S. is also preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who are currently holding two American hostages for ransom. The U.S. has already provided the Philippines with military aid, including weapons and training. President Bush has signed a $318 billion military spending bill for the 2002 fiscal year, emphasizing the need to maintain readiness and counter the deception of enemies.
