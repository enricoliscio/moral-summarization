SUMMARY:
The United States begins its first airlift of Guantanamo prisoners, with 20 heavily guarded Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees shackled and hooded on their way to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Pentagon provided few details, but it is known that the prisoners may have been sedated and will be held in a makeshift detention center called Camp X-Ray, locked in small cages. Amnesty International issued a statement saying that sedating or shackling prisoners for an entire flight would violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld defended the use of strong measures, citing the need to study violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners. The prisoners will be held for interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. In other news, a Marine Corps tanker plane crashed in Pakistan, killing seven marines, though Rumsfeld stated there was no evidence of hostile fire. The US is also preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, who are currently holding two American hostages for ransom. The US involvement in the Philippines may include direct military action if requested by the Philippine government. The US military also continues to target Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, with B-1 and B-52 bombers dropping precision-guided weapons.
