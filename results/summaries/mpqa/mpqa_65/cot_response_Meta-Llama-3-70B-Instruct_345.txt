SUMMARY:
The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in a makeshift detention center known as Camp X-Ray. The prisoners, shackled and hooded, were guarded by 40 specially trained military police officers during the 20-hour flight. Amnesty International has criticized the treatment of the prisoners, saying it violates international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment. The Pentagon has defended the measures, citing violent uprisings by Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the past. Meanwhile, the US is preparing to send a force of over 100 soldiers to the Philippines to help train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. The US has also promised to give the Philippines a $100 million antiterrorism aid package. END OF SUMMARY.
