Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the U.S. beginning the airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay. There's a lot of details here: the flight details, the number of prisoners, their treatment, the facilities at Guantanamo, and some other related news like the plane crash in Pakistan and involvement in the Philippines. 

Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the main points without getting bogged down in too many specifics. The user specified a summary of no more than 200 words, so I should be concise. 

First, the key event is the first airlift of prisoners. The Pentagon's involvement, the number of prisoners, their treatment during the flightâ€”shackled, hooded, possibly sedated. Also, the destination is Guantanamo Bay, and the conditions there. 

Then, there are other points like the plane crash in Pakistan, the U.S. sending troops to the Philippines, and the bombing in Afghanistan. These are secondary but still important to mention briefly. 

I should structure the summary to start with the main event, then touch on the other related news. Make sure to mention the concerns about treatment violating international standards. Also, include Rumsfeld's defense of the measures and the ongoing military actions. 

Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words. I'll need to condense each section, focusing on the essential information. Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise manner.

SUMMARY: The U.S. has initiated the first airlift of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with a C-17 cargo plane carrying 20 heavily guarded detainees. The flight, expected to reach its destination by Friday, included strict security measures, including shackling, hooding, and possible sedation. Pentagon officials stated the detainees would not be treated as prisoners of war but would still receive Geneva Convention protections. At Guantanamo Bay, they will be held in a temporary detention center, Camp X-Ray, while awaiting interrogation and potential trial. Meanwhile, the U.S. is preparing to send over 100 soldiers, including Special Operations forces, to the Philippines to assist in combating Abu Sayyaf militants. Additionally, American bombers targeted an Al Qaeda training camp in eastern Afghanistan for the sixth time in a week. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld signed a $318 billion military spending bill, emphasizing the need for readiness against enemies relying on surprise and deception. END OF SUMMARY.
