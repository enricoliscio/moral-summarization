SUMMARY: In a morally questionable move, the United States begins the first airlift of prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held in harsh conditions and possibly face military tribunals. The prisoners are shackled, hooded, and possibly sedated during the flight, raising concerns about their treatment and potential violations of international standards. The U.S. justifies these measures by citing the need to prevent violent uprisings, but Amnesty International criticizes the treatment as "cruel, inhuman or degrading." The U.S. also increases its involvement in the Philippines, sending troops to advise and possibly assist in direct military action against Muslim militants. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld defends the use of strong measures against the prisoners and emphasizes the need for readiness and deterrence against enemies who rely on surprise and deception. The U.S. military continues to target Al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan, but officials worry about other underground complexes that could harbor remnants of these groups. END OF SUMMARY.
