SUMMARY:

The US has begun airlifting Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they will be held and interrogated. The first flight carried 20 prisoners, who were heavily guarded and restrained with shackles and hoods. The Pentagon claims they are not prisoners of war, but will be afforded Geneva Convention protections. Human rights group Amnesty International has criticized the use of restraints, saying it violates international standards. The prisoners will be held in makeshift detention centers, where they will face intensive interrogation and possible trial before military tribunals. Meanwhile, the US is also increasing its involvement in the Philippines, where it will send over 100 soldiers to train Filipino troops to fight Muslim militants. The US has also continued to bomb Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, and has signed a $318 billion military spending bill.
