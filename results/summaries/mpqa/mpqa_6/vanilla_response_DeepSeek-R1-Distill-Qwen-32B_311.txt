Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Brazil and Germany working together to push for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. They've released a document called the Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan. Their main goal is to get the Kyoto Protocol enforced by the Rio+10 summit in South Africa next month. They also want other countries to ratify the protocol. 

The document mentions expanding cooperation in environmental and sustainable development areas. They plan to present common positions at the Rio+10 meeting. Additionally, they highlight the importance of the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests (PPG-7) and Germany's involvement in it.

I should make sure the summary includes all these key points: the countries involved, the document's name, the goal of the Kyoto Protocol by Rio+10, urging other countries to ratify, expanding cooperation, presenting common positions, and the mention of PPG-7 and Germany's participation. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me put it all together in a coherent way without missing any important details.
