Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Brazil and Germany calling for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the original text mentions that both countries are expressing interest in the Kyoto Protocol taking effect by the Rio+10 summit in September. They also call on other countries to ratify it and work towards enforcement. Plus, they plan to expand environmental cooperation and present common positions at the summit. They also highlight the importance of the PPG-7 program.

I should make sure to include all these points but keep it concise, under 200 words. I need to maintain the moral aspect, which probably emphasizes their commitment to sustainability and global cooperation. I'll start by stating their joint commitment, mention the call for ratification, the expansion of cooperation, and the focus on the PPG-7. I'll end with their goal to present common positions at the summit. Let me structure this clearly and concisely.
