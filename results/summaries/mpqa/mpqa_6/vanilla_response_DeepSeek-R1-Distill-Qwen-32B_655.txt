Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read it carefully. The article is about Brazil and Germany working together to push for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. They've released a document called the Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan. They want the protocol to take effect by the Sustainable Development Summit, which is Rio+10 in South Africa next September. They also urge other countries to ratify and enforce it. 

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points. I should mention the countries involved, the document, their goal for the Kyoto Protocol, the call for other countries to join, their plan to expand environmental cooperation, presenting common positions at Rio+10, and the mention of the PPG-7 program with German involvement.

I need to make sure I capture all these elements without getting too wordy. Maybe start with the countries and their initiative, then the document, the target event, the call to action for other nations, their cooperation plans, and the program they're involved in. Keep it clear and straightforward.
