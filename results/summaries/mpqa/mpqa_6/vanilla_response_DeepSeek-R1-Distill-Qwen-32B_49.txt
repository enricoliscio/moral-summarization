Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Brazil and Germany calling for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. The user provided the article and an example response. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article mentions that Brazil and Germany have a document called "Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan." They want the Kyoto Protocol to take effect by the Sustainable Development Summit in September, which is Rio+10 in South Africa. They're calling on other countries to ratify and enforce the protocol. They also plan to expand their environmental cooperation and present common positions at Rio+10. Additionally, they highlight the importance of the PPG-7 program and Germany's participation.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." The example provided is concise, so I should follow that structure. I should include the main points: the countries involved, their call for the protocol's implementation by Rio+10, their invitation to other countries, their intention to expand cooperation, presenting common positions, and mentioning the PPG-7 program.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Let me check the word count as I draft it to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I need to maintain the key elements: the document's title, the target event, the call to action for other countries, cooperation expansion, common positions, and the PPG-7 mention.

I think I have all the necessary components. Now, I'll structure it in a few sentences, making sure each point is covered succinctly.
