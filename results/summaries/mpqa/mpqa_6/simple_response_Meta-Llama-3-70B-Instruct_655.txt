SUMMARY:

Brazil and Germany have joined forces to urge the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September, in time for the Sustainable Development Summit (Rio+10) in South Africa. Through their Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan, they are calling on other countries to ratify and enforce the protocol, emphasizing the importance of collective action in protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development. This moral imperative is rooted in the recognition of the critical role that tropical forests play in maintaining ecological balance, as highlighted by the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests (PPG-7). By working together, Brazil and Germany aim to present a united front at the Rio+10 meeting, demonstrating their commitment to responsible stewardship of the planet. This cooperation serves as a beacon of hope, inspiring other nations to follow suit and prioritize the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.
