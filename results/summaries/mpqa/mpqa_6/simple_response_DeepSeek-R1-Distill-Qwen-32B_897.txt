Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, the article is about Brazil and Germany pushing for the Kyoto Protocol's implementation by September. They also want other countries to ratify it. The user mentioned being a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical aspect here.

First, I should identify the key points: the partnership document, the goal of implementing Kyoto by Rio+10, collaboration on environmental issues, and support for the tropical forests program. I need to make sure the summary highlights their commitment to sustainability and global responsibility. That's the moral angleâ€”their proactive stance on environmental issues.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Maybe start by stating their commitment, then mention the specific actions like the document, calling on other countries, expanding cooperation, and the program. I need to ensure the summary flows well and clearly conveys their moral stance on environmental protection.

Let me structure it: introduce the countries and their commitment, detail their actions, and conclude with the significance of the partnership. That should cover all bases without being too lengthy. Also, using terms like "global responsibility" and "sustainability" will emphasize the moral framing as the user requested.
