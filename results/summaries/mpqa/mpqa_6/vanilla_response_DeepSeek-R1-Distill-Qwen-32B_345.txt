Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Brazil and Germany calling for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article mentions that both countries have a document called "Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan." They want the Kyoto Protocol to take effect by the Sustainable Development Summit, which is Rio+10, happening in South Africa next September. They're urging other countries to ratify the protocol and help enforce it. Also, they plan to expand their environmental and sustainable development cooperation. They'll present common positions at the Rio+10 meeting. Lastly, they highlight the importance of the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests (PPG-7) and Germany's involvement in it.

So, I need to condense this into a summary that's under 200 words. I should start by stating that Brazil and Germany are pushing for the Kyoto Protocol's implementation by September. Then mention the document, the countries' call for others to ratify, their intent to expand cooperation, and their plan to present common positions. Finally, include the part about the PPG-7 program.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, covering all the main points without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the countries and their call, the document's purpose, the request to other nations, the cooperation expansion, the common positions at the summit, and the program emphasis.

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent way, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
