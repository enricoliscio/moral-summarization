Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words "development" and "protection." The article is about Brazil and Germany's efforts to implement the Kyoto Protocol by September. They want other countries to ratify it and are expanding their environmental cooperation. They also mention the PPG-7 program.

First, I should identify the key points: the countries' partnership, the goal for the Kyoto Protocol, their call to other nations, expanding environmental cooperation, common positions at Rio+10, and the PPG-7 program.

I need to make sure to include the moral terms "development" and "protection." I'll start by stating their commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. Then, mention their call for the Kyoto Protocol's implementation. I'll include their invitation to other countries and their plan to strengthen cooperation. Finally, I'll highlight the PPG-7 program and their intent to present common positions at the summit.

I'll structure the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while keeping the moral framing intact.
