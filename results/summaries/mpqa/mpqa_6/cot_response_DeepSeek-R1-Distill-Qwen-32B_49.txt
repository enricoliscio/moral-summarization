Alright, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want a summary that includes the morally framed words from the original text. The user provided a structure where I first list the morally framed words, then write a concise summary.

Looking at the article, the key points are Brazil and Germany's call for the Kyoto Protocol's implementation by September, their interest in expanding environmental cooperation, and their emphasis on the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests. 

Now, identifying the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. Words like "call," "implement," "interest," "ratify," "expand," "cooperation," "expect," "stress," "importance," and "participation" seem to fit. Each of these words implies a proactive or supportive stance, which is the moral framing here.

Next, I need to craft a summary that includes these words. It should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of Brazil and Germany's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and their environmental efforts. I'll make sure to include the key points: their call for implementation, the countries involved, the expansion of cooperation, and the specific programs they're emphasizing.

I should also ensure that the summary flows naturally, maintaining the original's positive tone. It's important to highlight their proactive role in global environmental efforts, showing their leadership and commitment.

Putting it all together, I'll start with the morally framed words, then move on to the summary, making sure each point is covered succinctly. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure clarity.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it into the required format.
