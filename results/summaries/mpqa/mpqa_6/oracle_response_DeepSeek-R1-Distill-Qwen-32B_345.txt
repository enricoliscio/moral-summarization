Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want a news summary that preserves the moral framing. They provided a specific article and highlighted the words 'development' and 'protection' as the moral elements. My task is to summarize the article while keeping those words intact.

First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Brazil and Germany wanting the Kyoto Protocol to be implemented by September. They're pushing for other countries to ratify it and expand their environmental cooperation. Also, they mention the PPG-7 program.

I should start by identifying the key points: both countries' call for the protocol's implementation, their intention to cooperate more in environment and sustainable development, and their focus on the PPG-7. 

Now, the moral framing words are 'development' and 'protection'. I need to ensure these are included. I'll structure the summary to highlight their commitment to sustainable development and forest protection. 

I should also keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the necessary details and the moral terms. 

Wait, the original response I gave was correct, but I should check if I included all the points: the document's title, the call for ratification, the cooperation in environment and sustainable development, presenting common positions, and the PPG-7. Yes, that's all covered. 

I think that's a solid summary. It captures the main points while emphasizing the moral aspects the user wanted.
