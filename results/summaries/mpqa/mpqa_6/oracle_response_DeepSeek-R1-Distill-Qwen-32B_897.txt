Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing, specifically the words "development" and "protection." Let me read through the article again. 

The article is about Brazil and Germany collaborating to push for the Kyoto Protocol's implementation by September. They're emphasizing sustainable development and environmental protection. They also mention expanding cooperation in these areas and the PPG-7 program.

I need to make sure the summary includes "development" and "protection." I should start by stating their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. Then mention the Rio+10 summit and their call for other countries to ratify it. Highlight their plan to expand cooperation in sustainable development and environmental protection. Finally, note the importance of the PPG-7 program.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me piece it together, ensuring those key terms are included naturally. Make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of their partnership and moral stance on the environment.
