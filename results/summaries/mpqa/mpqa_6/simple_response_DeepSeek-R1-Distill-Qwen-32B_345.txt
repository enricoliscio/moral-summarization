Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Brazil and Germany calling for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol by September. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It mentions a document called "Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan." The main points are that both countries want the Kyoto Protocol to take effect by Rio+10 in September. They're urging other countries to ratify and enforce it. They also plan to expand environmental cooperation and present common positions at the summit. Additionally, they highlight the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests (PPG-7) and Germany's involvement.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these points. I should start by stating the countries' commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. Then mention their call to other nations to ratify. Include their plan to expand cooperation and present joint positions. Finally, note the emphasis on PPG-7 and German participation.

I should structure it clearly, using the "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward. Let me put it all together concisely.
