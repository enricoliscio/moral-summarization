Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Brazil and Germany working together on the Kyoto Protocol. The author used words like "development" and "protection," so I need to make sure those are included.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It mentions the document called "Partnership Brasil-Germany: Action Plan." They want the Kyoto Protocol implemented by September at the Rio+10 summit in South Africa. They're calling on other countries to ratify it and enforce it. Also, they plan to expand environmental cooperation and present common positions at the summit. Plus, they highlight the Pilot Program for Protection of Tropical Forests (PPG-7) and German involvement.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start by stating Brazil and Germany's commitment, mention the document, their goal for the Kyoto Protocol, and the call to other countries. Then, include their plan to expand cooperation and present common positions. Finally, note the emphasis on PPG-7 and German participation.

I'll make sure to use "development" and "protection" as they are key moral terms. Also, keep the language clear and concise. Let me structure it step by step to cover all points without exceeding the word limit.
