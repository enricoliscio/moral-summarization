SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China has been criticized by human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report was called "absurd" and "fabricated," with the intention to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. Experts pointed out that the United States has no right to issue such a report and that it violates the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs. The report contains incorrect facts and uses human rights issues to slander China, particularly in Tibet and Xinjiang. For example, the report accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet and using anti-terrorism campaigns to target Muslim Uighur activists in Xinjiang. Chinese experts refute these claims, stating that the report relies on unsubstantiated stories and that anyone engaging in terrorism, regardless of ethnicity, should be brought to justice. The Italian senator, Renzo Gubert, praised China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage in Tibet, which contrasts with the US report's claims. The report also lists incidents of alleged religious freedom violations, such as the arrest of a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles, which Chinese officials say violated Chinese law.
