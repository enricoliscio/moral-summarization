SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with exaggerations, fabrications, and slanders, according to human rights experts. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The US has no right to issue such a false report, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are incorrect, using human rights issues to slander China. In contrast, experts who have visited Tibet have seen the ever-improving human rights situation, with the Chinese Government making efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are baseless, using unsubstantiated stories to illustrate its claims. Similarly, the report's accusations of cracking down on ethnic groups in Xinjiang are misguided, as China is simply bringing terrorists to justice, regardless of their ethnicity. The US report is a reckless conclusion, compiled with a biased agenda.

END OF SUMMARY.
