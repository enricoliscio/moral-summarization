SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by human rights experts as containing little truth and many fabrications. The report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese government. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report is also accused of using unsubstantiated stories to illustrate its claims, including accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet. However, Italian senator Renzo Gubert, who has visited Tibet, praised the Chinese government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's claims are also disputed by Chinese officials, who argue that the country has made significant progress in human rights, including the protection of religious freedom.
