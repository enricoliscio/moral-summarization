SUMMARY: Human rights experts criticized the US State Department's recent report on human rights practices in China, calling it a slanderous attempt to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. They highlighted factual inaccuracies and violations of UN principles of non-interference in internal affairs. Chinese officials and scholars refuted the report's accusations, emphasizing the improvement of human rights in Tibet and the protection of religious freedom. They cited the experiences of foreign visitors who witnessed the positive changes. The report was criticized for using unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases to support its assertions. The case of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles, was highlighted as an example of religious freedom violation, but Chinese religious leaders refuted this claim. The report also accused China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which was refuted by experts. The summary concludes that the US report contains exaggerations, fabrications, and violations of international norms, and that China is committed to protecting human rights and improving the lives of its citizens.
