SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China is riddled with absurdities, exaggerations, and fabrications, according to human rights experts. The report aims to malign China and exert political pressure, violating the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. The report contains unfounded allegations and reckless conclusions, accusing China of restricting religious freedom and cracking down on ethnic groups under the guise of anti-terrorism. Experts refute these claims, highlighting the protection of indigenous culture and religious heritage in Tibet and the availability of Bibles for China's Protestants. The report's accusations of China taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to target Muslim Uighur activists are also refuted, with experts drawing parallels to the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. The US report is seen as a morally bankrupt attempt to tarnish China's image by violating UN principles and spreading misinformation. END OF SUMMARY.
