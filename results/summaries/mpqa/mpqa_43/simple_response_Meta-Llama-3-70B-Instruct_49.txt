SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is slammed by experts as containing "little truth and many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications". The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report is also criticized for its procedural mistakes and incorrect facts. In contrast, Western visitors to Tibet have praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are disputed, with local Tibetans enjoying a high level of religious freedom. The report's use of unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases is also questioned. Experts argue that the US report is biased and politically motivated, and that China's efforts to combat terrorism and protect its citizens should not be misinterpreted.
