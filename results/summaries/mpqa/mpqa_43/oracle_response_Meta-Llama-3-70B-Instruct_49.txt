SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with exaggerations, fabrications, and inaccuracies, according to human rights experts. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The US has no right to issue such a false report, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are incorrect, and it uses human rights issues to slander China. In contrast, experts and officials who have visited Tibet have seen the ever-improving human rights situation, with the Chinese Government making efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are unfounded, and its claims of human rights violations are based on unsubstantiated stories. The US report is an attempt to legitimize measures against minority groups under the anti-terrorism umbrella, but experts argue that those who engage in terrorism, regardless of ethnicity, should be brought to justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
