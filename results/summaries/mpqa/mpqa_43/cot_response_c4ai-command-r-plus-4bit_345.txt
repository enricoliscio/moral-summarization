SUMMARY: The annual US State Department report on human rights practices in China is full of *absurdities*, *exaggerations*, and *fabrications*, according to human rights experts speaking at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report is seen as an attempt to *tarnish* China's image and *exert political pressure* on the Chinese government. Experts pointed out that the United States has no *right* to issue such a report and that it *violates* the UN principle of non-*interference* in internal affairs. The report contains many *unsubstantiated* stories and *doubtful* phrases to back up its assertions. For example, it criticizes China for arresting a Hong Kong businessman who was smuggling Bibles into the country, despite his behavior *violating* Chinese law. The report also accuses China of using anti-*terrorism* campaigns to *crackdown* on ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which experts refute as a *mistake* in conflating terrorists with a particular ethnic group. The United States is *analogous* to China in its own *crackdown* on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. The CSSHR president concludes that the report *softens* its tone but still *slanders* China with *false* accusations.
