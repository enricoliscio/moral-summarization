SUMMARY: The annual US State Department human rights report on China is full of fabrications and exaggerations aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure on the Chinese government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report contains many incorrect facts and uses human rights issues to slander China, said CSSHR President Zhou Jue. Professor Xirao-Nima, a Tibetan himself, said that he has seen the ever-improving human rights situation in the Tibet Autonomous Region, contrary to the false claims made by some US politicians. The report accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet, but fails to provide substantiated evidence. It also lists incidents of so-called religious freedom violations, such as the arrest of a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles into China, which are backed by heresy claims. The report further accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which Chinese experts refute, stating that the actions target terrorists, not any specific ethnic group. The US human rights report violates the UN spirit of non-interference and ignores China's efforts to protect cultural heritage and develop the local economy in Tibet.
END OF SUMMARY.
