Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US State Department's human rights report on China, and it's quite critical of the report. The author is arguing that the report is full of lies, exaggerations, and fabrications, and that the US is trying to tarnish China's image. 

First, I should identify the main points. The report was published, and Chinese experts are saying it's false and politically motivated. They mention specific examples, like the case of Li Guangqiang and the situation in Tibet. The article also talks about how the US is using the report to pressure China, and that this goes against UN principles. There are quotes from experts and officials, including a Tibetan professor and a former UN deputy secretary-general. They argue that the US has no right to interfere and that the report's claims are not true.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key arguments: the US report is false, it's politically motivated, it violates international principles, and there are examples of incorrect claims. Also, the experts are providing counterpoints, like the investment in Tibet's monasteries and the fact that many Westerners who visited Tibet saw improvements in human rights.

I should structure the summary to highlight that the US report is criticized for being inaccurate and biased, aiming to pressure China. Include mentions of the experts' viewpoints, the specific examples, and the contrast between the report's claims and the reality as seen by visitors to Tibet.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll start by stating the report's publication and the criticism it received. Then mention the experts' arguments, the procedural and factual issues, the examples of false claims, and the counterpoints from Tibet and Xinjiang. Finally, conclude with the experts' assertion that the US is violating international norms.

I should avoid any markdown and just write a clear, concise summary in plain text. Make sure to include all the main moral points without getting too detailed. Keep the focus on the US's actions and the Chinese response, emphasizing the moral framing that the US is acting improperly.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China has been criticized as false and politically motivated, aiming to tarnish China's image. Experts argue the report violates UN principles and international law, with no authorization to compile such findings. Specific claims, like restrictions on religious freedom in Tibet and anti-terrorism measures in Xinjiang, are dismissed as fabrications. Tibetan experts highlight China's efforts to preserve cultural heritage and religious freedom, while visitors, including Italian senator Renzo Gubert, attest to Tibet's progress. The report's unsubstantiated allegations, such as the case of Li Guangqiang, are refuted by Chinese officials. Experts emphasize that terrorism, not ethnicity, should determine legal action, aligning with global counter-terrorism efforts. The report is seen as a tool to exert political pressure, contrary to international norms. END OF SUMMARY.
