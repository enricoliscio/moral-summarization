Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report, specifically focusing on the part about China. It seems the report is criticized by Chinese experts and officials. They argue that the report is full of lies and is aimed at damaging China's image and applying political pressure.

I notice that the report is from 2001, so it's a bit old, but the content is still relevant in terms of the US-China dynamics on human rights. The experts mentioned, like Xirao-Nima and Jin Yongjian, are pointing out that the US is slandering China and violating UN principles by interfering in internal affairs.

The article also mentions specific examples, like the case of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles. The Chinese Christian Council explains that the Bibles were from a banned sect, so his arrest was lawful. This shows the US report's accusations are unfounded.

Another point is about Tibet. The report claims human rights issues, but experts and even an Italian senator, Renzo Gubert, praise China's efforts in Tibet, including economic development and religious freedom. They counter the US claims by providing positive examples and investments in cultural preservation.

In Xinjiang, the US report accuses China of using anti-terrorism to target Uighurs. Chinese officials argue that terrorism is the issue, not the ethnicity, and that China's actions are similar to the US's approach in Afghanistan. They emphasize that all terrorists, regardless of ethnicity, should be dealt with.

So, the main points are: the US report is biased and inaccurate, China's experts and officials refute the claims with examples, and China is portrayed as protecting human rights while the US is overstepping its bounds.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the US report's purpose, then mention the criticism from Chinese experts, specific examples like Tibet and Xinjiang, and the counterarguments about religious freedom and terrorism. I'll make sure to highlight that the US is accused of violating UN principles and that China's actions are justified.
