SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China has been criticized by human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report was described as containing falsehoods, exaggerations, and fabrications aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts pointed out that the United States has no right to issue such a report and that it violates the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. They also refuted specific allegations in the report, such as restrictions on religious freedom in Tibet and the crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The experts provided evidence of the Chinese government's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage and noted that the report relies on unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases. They also refuted the claim that China arrested a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles, stating that his actions violated Chinese law and involved a banned heretical sect. The report was criticized for using the anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan as a pretext to legitimize measures against Muslim Uighur activists. The experts emphasized that China's actions target terrorists, not any particular ethnic group, drawing a parallel with the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists.
