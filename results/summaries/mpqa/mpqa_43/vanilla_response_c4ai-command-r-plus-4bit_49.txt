SUMMARY: The annual US State Department human rights report on China has drawn criticism from human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report is seen as an attempt to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure, containing exaggerations, fabrications, and a disregard for the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Experts pointed out procedural and factual inaccuracies, including allegations of religious freedom restrictions in Tibet and misuse of anti-terrorism campaigns in Xinjiang. They highlighted the positive assessment of religious freedom in Tibet by Italian senator Renzo Gubert, contrasting it with the report's unfounded accusations. The report's reliance on dubious sources and its failure to acknowledge China's efforts to meet the religious needs of its citizens, such as printing Bibles in various languages, were also criticized. The criticism underscores the report's biased nature and disregard for China's efforts to uphold human rights while maintaining social stability. END OF SUMMARY.
