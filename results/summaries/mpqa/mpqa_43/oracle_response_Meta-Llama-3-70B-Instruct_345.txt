SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with exaggerations, fabrications, and inaccuracies, according to human rights experts. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The experts argue that the US has no right to issue such a false report, as it violates the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are incorrect, and it uses human rights issues to slander China. In contrast, experts who have visited Tibet have seen the ever-improving human rights situation, with the Chinese Government making efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are unfounded, and its use of unsubstantiated stories to illustrate its claims is misleading. The report's reckless conclusions are based on doubtful phrases and anecdotes, rather than truth. The Chinese Government's efforts to combat terrorism and protect its citizens are legitimate, and the US report's attempts to legitimize measures against Muslim Uighur activists under the anti-terrorism umbrella are misguided.

END OF SUMMARY.
