SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is deemed "false" and "slandering" by human rights experts. The report is accused of containing "absurdities", "exaggerations", and "fabrications" aimed at "tarnishing" China's image and exerting political pressure on the Chinese Government. Experts argue that the US has "violated" the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and has no right to issue such a report. The report's claims on Tibet are disputed by those who have visited the region, including Italian senator Renzo Gubert, who praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are "blindly" made, and its use of "unsubstantiated stories" is "reckless". END OF SUMMARY.
