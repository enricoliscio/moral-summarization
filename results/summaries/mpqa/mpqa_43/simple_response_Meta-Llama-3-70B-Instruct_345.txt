SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is criticized for containing "little truth and many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications." Human rights experts argue that the report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The report is accused of violating the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs and making procedural mistakes. Experts point out that the report uses unsubstantiated stories and anecdotes to illustrate its claims, and that the facts are incorrect. In contrast, Western visitors to Tibet have praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are disputed, and its criticism of China's anti-terrorism campaigns in Xinjiang is seen as misguided. Overall, the report is seen as an attempt to slander China and exert political pressure, rather than a genuine assessment of human rights practices.
