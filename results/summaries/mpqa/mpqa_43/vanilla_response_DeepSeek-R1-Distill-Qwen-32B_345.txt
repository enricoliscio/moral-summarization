Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the US State Department's human rights report on China. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the US published its annual report, and as usual, the part about China is filled with inaccuracies, fabrications, and exaggerations. The purpose of the report is to tarnish China's image and apply political pressure. There's a seminar by the China Society for Study of Human Rights where experts criticized the report.

Some experts, like Professor Xirao-Nima, say the US is slandering China and has no right to issue such reports. Jin Yongjian, a former UN deputy secretary-general, points out that the US is violating the UN's non-interference principle and the UN Charter.

The report is criticized for procedural mistakes and incorrect facts. CSSHR President Zhou Jue mentions that while the tone is a bit softer, it still uses human rights issues to slander China. Xirao-Nima, a Tibetan professor, says he's visited Tibet and seen the improvements, which contrast with US politicians' descriptions. Italian senator Renzo Gubert also praised China's efforts in Tibet, noting the protection of cultural and religious heritage and the high level of religious freedom.

The article then talks about specific cases, like Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles. Rev Cao Shengjie explains that the Bibles were from a banned sect, so the arrest was lawful. China has been printing Bibles in various languages to meet the needs of Protestants.

The report also accuses China of using anti-terrorism efforts to crack down on ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Ma Dazheng from the Xinjiang Development Research Institute counters this, saying that only terrorists, regardless of ethnicity, should be targeted, similar to the US's approach in Afghanistan.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: the US report's inaccuracies, the criticism from Chinese experts, examples of Tibet and Xinjiang, and the defense of China's policies. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and starts with SUMMARY: and ends with END OF SUMMARY.

I should structure it by first stating the report's inaccuracies, then the criticism from experts, mention Tibet and Xinjiang as examples, and conclude with the counterarguments from Chinese officials.
