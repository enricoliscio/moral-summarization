SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with exaggerations, fabrications, and inaccuracies, according to human rights experts. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The US has no right to issue such a false report, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's tone may have softened, but it still uses human rights issues to slander China. In reality, Tibet has seen ever-improving human rights, with the Chinese Government making efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are unfounded, with local Tibetans enjoying a high level of religious freedom. The report's use of unsubstantiated stories and anecdotes to illustrate its assertions is misleading. In contrast, China has made significant investments in repairing and updating monasteries, and has printed millions of Bibles to meet the demand of Protestant communities.
