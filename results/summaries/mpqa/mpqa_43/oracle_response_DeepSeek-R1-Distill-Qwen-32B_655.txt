Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the US State Department's human rights report on China, which the author and experts are criticizing as false and biased.

I notice the article uses several morally charged words like "truth," "exaggerations," "fabrications," and "slandering." My goal is to include as many of these as possible in the summary without losing the essence.

The article mentions that the report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. Experts like Xirao-Nima and Jin Yongjian are quoted, emphasizing that the US is violating UN principles by interfering in China's internal affairs. They point out that the report's facts are incorrect and uses false claims to slander China.

There are specific examples given, like the case of Li Guangqiang and the accusations against Xinjiang. These are used to show how the US report is misleading. The author also highlights positive developments in Tibet, such as improved human rights and religious freedom, which contrast with the US report's claims.

I should structure the summary to first state the US report's purpose, then the criticism from Chinese experts, followed by examples of inaccuracies and positive developments. I'll make sure to use the moral words provided to maintain the original framing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. I'll start by stating the report's publication and its purpose, then move on to the experts' criticism, the false claims, and the counterarguments with examples. Finally, I'll conclude by emphasizing the US's violation of international norms and the contrast with China's efforts.

Let me draft this, ensuring each paragraph is clear and flows logically, using the morally framed words effectively.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report on China was criticized for containing exaggerations, fabrications, and falsehoods aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts argued that the report slanders China and violates UN principles, as the US has no right to compile or release such reports without UN authorization. The report was accused of using unsubstantiated claims to falsely accuse China of restricting religious freedom and targeting ethnic groups in Xinjiang. For instance, it falsely accused China of arresting a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles, while experts noted that the smuggled Bibles were from a banned sect. The report also misleadingly linked anti-terrorism efforts to suppress Uighurs, ignoring China's lawful actions against terrorism. In contrast, China's efforts to protect religious freedom and cultural heritage in Tibet, as well as its investment in monasteries and economic development, were highlighted. Experts emphasized that the US report's conclusions were incorrect and that its use of "credible reports" and "anecdotal evidence" was untrustworthy. The report's accusations were seen as a violation of international norms, while China's actions were defended as legitimate efforts to protect human rights and combat terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
