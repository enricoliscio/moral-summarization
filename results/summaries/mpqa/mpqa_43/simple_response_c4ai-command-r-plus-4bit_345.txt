SUMMARY: The annual US State Department human rights report on China is full of falsehoods and exaggerations aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report, which accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet and cracking down on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, is seen as a violation of the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Chinese experts and officials provided evidence and testimonials that contradict the report's claims, highlighting the improving human rights situation in Tibet and the government's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage. The report's reliance on unsubstantiated stories and vague phrases undermines its credibility, and its accusations are refuted by firsthand accounts of visitors to the region, including an Italian senator who praised China's efforts. The report's accusations regarding the arrest of a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles were also contradicted by a representative of the China Christian Council, who stated that the smuggled Bibles were heretical and banned. The US report's attempt to link China's anti-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang to a crackdown on a specific ethnic group was criticized as a mistake, emphasizing that terrorists, regardless of ethnicity, should face justice. The summary concludes that the US report is misleading and politically motivated, with Chinese experts and officials providing compelling evidence to refute its claims and defend China's human rights record.
