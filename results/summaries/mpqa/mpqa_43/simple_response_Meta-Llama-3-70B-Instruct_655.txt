SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is criticized for containing little truth and many fabrications, aiming to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. Human rights experts argue that the US has no right to issue such a report, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs. The report is accused of using human rights issues to slander China, with incorrect facts and unsubstantiated stories. In contrast, Westerners who have visited Tibet have praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are contradicted by Italian senator Renzo Gubert, who observed a high level of religious freedom in the region. The report's claims are further disputed by examples of China's efforts to protect human rights, such as investing in the renovation of monasteries and promoting religious freedom.
