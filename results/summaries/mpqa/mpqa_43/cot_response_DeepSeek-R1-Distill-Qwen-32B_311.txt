Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this user's query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

So, the user provided a news article about the US State Department's human rights report on China. The article criticizes the report, calling it full of fabrications and slanders. My first step is to go through the text and pick out all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "absurdities," "exaggerations," "fabrications," "tarnish," "slander," "violated," etc., stand out as they carry strong moral judgments.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll need to capture the main points: the US report's criticism, the Chinese experts' rebuttal, the examples from Tibet and Xinjiang, and the argument against the US's moral high ground.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the Chinese perspective on the report's inaccuracies and the misuse of human rights issues for political pressure. I'll also need to mention the counterarguments from experts and international figures to support China's stance.

Finally, I'll structure the response with the identified words first, each on a new line, and then the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I need to be careful to preserve the moral framing without adding any personal bias, just reflecting the article's content.

**SUMMARY:**  

The US State Department's 2001 human rights report on China was criticized for containing absurdities, fabrications, and exaggerations aimed at tarnishing China's image. Experts argued that the report slanders China and violates UN principles by interfering in internal affairs. Prof. Xirao-Nima and former UN official Jin Yongjian accused the US of spreading false claims, while CSSHR President Zhou Jue noted the report softened its tone but still used human rights issues to slander China. Tibetan experts and international visitors, including Italian Senator Renzo Gubert, praised China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage in Tibet, contradicting the US report's claims of religious restrictions. The report also accused China of using anti-terrorism efforts to crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, a claim dismissed by experts who emphasized that terrorism, not ethnicity, should determine justice. The summary highlights the moral framing of the US report as false, unwarranted, and politically motivated.
