SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is criticized for containing "false" and "absurd" claims, aimed at "tarnishing" China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts say the report is a "slanderous" attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, violating the UN spirit of non-interference. The report's claims of human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang are disputed, with some Westerners praising China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage. The report is accused of using "unsubstantiated" stories and "reckless" conclusions to support its claims. In contrast, China's efforts to combat terrorism and maintain social stability are seen as legitimate. The report's bias and inaccuracies are seen as a "mistake" that undermines its credibility.
