SUMMARY: Once again, the US State Department published its annual report on human rights, and once more, the section on China is rife with falsehoods and exaggerations aimed at besmirching China's reputation and exerting political pressure. The report, criticized by human rights experts at a seminar, violates the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. The facts presented in the report are incorrect and distort the reality of the situation in Tibet, where religious freedom and human rights are respected and protected by the Chinese Government. The report relies on unsubstantiated anecdotes and dubious sources to make its accusations, such as the case of a Hong Kong businessman arrested for illegally smuggling Bibles into China, which the report incorrectly claims was a violation of religious freedom. The US report also wrongly accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in Xinjiang, when in fact China is rightly targeting terrorists, regardless of their ethnicity. The hypocrisy of the US is evident, as they themselves are fighting Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan while claiming to respect Islam. China has every right to protect its sovereignty and combat terrorism, and the US has no right to pass judgment and spread misinformation through these biased reports.
END OF SUMMARY.
