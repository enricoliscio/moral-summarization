SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by experts as being filled with falsehoods, exaggerations, and fabrications. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs. The report's facts are incorrect, and it uses human rights issues to slander China. In contrast, Westerners who have visited Tibet have praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are baseless, and its claims of human rights violations are unsubstantiated. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, and its actions are a procedural mistake that violates the UN Charter and international principles.
