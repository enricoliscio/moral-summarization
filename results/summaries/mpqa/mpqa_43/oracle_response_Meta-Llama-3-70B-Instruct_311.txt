SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with exaggerations, fabrications, and inaccuracies, aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure on the Chinese Government. Human rights experts argue that the report violates the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs and slanders China. The facts presented are incorrect, and the report uses human rights issues to slander China. In contrast, experts who have visited Tibet have seen the ever-improving human rights situation, with the Chinese Government making efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are baseless, relying on unsubstantiated stories and anecdotes. Similarly, the report's claims about China's crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang are misguided, as China is simply combating terrorism and secessionist activities. The report's morally bankrupt approach is evident in its reckless conclusions and biased presentation of facts.

END OF SUMMARY.
