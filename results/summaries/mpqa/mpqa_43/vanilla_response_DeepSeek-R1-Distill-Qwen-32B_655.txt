Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the US State Department's human rights report on China. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the article mentions that the US report on China is filled with inaccuracies and is meant to damage China's image. Experts from the China Society for Study of Human Rights criticized the report as false and a violation of UN principles.

Next, the report is accused of slandering China, especially regarding Tibet. Professors and officials, including a Tibetan expert, argue that the US is using human rights issues to pressure China. They mention the improvements in Tibet's human rights and economic development, supported by international visitors like the Italian senator.

Then, the article discusses the US report's claims about religious freedom, using examples like Li Guangqiang. The Chinese officials counter that the report uses unreliable sources and that China respects religious freedom within the law, even banning extremist groups.

Lastly, the report is criticized for using anti-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang to target Uighurs. Chinese experts argue that terrorism, not ethnicity, should be the focus, similar to how the US handles terrorism.

I need to condense all these points into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the US report's inaccuracies, China's criticism, examples from Tibet and Xinjiang, and the defense of China's policies.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's 2001 human rights report on China was criticized by Chinese experts as false and aimed at tarnishing China's image. At a seminar by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR), experts accused the US of violating UN principles and interfering in China's internal affairs. The report was described as slanderous, with China's human rights situation in Tibet and Xinjiang being particularly targeted. Chinese officials, including Tibetan expert Xirao-Nima, argued that the report's claims were unsubstantiated and contradicted the reality of improved human rights and economic development in Tibet. Italian senator Renzo Gubert praised China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage in Tibet. The report also falsely accused China of restricting religious freedom, using examples like the arrest of Li Guangqiang for smuggling banned Bibles. China defended its legal actions and emphasized its commitment to religious freedom within the law. Additionally, the report was criticized for using anti-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang to justify cracking down on Uighurs, with Chinese experts asserting that terrorism, not ethnicity, should be the focus. END OF SUMMARY.
