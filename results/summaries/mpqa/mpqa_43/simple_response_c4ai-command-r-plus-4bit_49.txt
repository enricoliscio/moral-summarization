SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China is riddled with falsehoods and exaggerations, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report, which aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure, contains baseless accusations of religious freedom restrictions in Tibet and misuse of anti-terrorism campaigns against ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The report's claims are refuted by firsthand accounts of improving human rights in Tibet, including religious freedom for local Tibetans, as observed by Italian senator Renzo Gubert and a delegation. The report's methodology is also questionable, relying on unverifiable sources and anecdotal evidence. Chinese officials and religious leaders counter specific incidents mentioned in the report, such as the arrest of a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bible editions translated by a banned heretical sect. The US report's procedural and factual inaccuracies violate UN principles of non-interference in internal affairs, said Jin Yongjian, a former UN deputy secretary-general. China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage while developing the economy were highlighted, along with significant investments in repairing and preserving sites like the Potala Palace. Experts concluded that the US report's motive is to slander China and exert political pressure, demonstrating a disregard for the truth and the UN Charter.
