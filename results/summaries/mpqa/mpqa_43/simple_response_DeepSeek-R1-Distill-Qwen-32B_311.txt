Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US State Department's human rights report on China, which China is criticizing as false and politically motivated. 

First, I should identify the main points. The report is accused of slandering China, violating UN principles, and containing false information. Experts from China argue that the US has no right to issue such reports and that they interfere with China's internal affairs. There are specific examples like the case of Li Guangqiang and the situation in Tibet and Xinjiang. 

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral stance presented, which is that the US is unfairly targeting China. I should mention the experts' opinions, the examples given, and the contrast with positive reports from other sources, like the Italian senator. 

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include key terms like "false allegations," "political pressure," and "interference." Also, highlight the positive developments in Tibet and Xinjiang as counterpoints to the US report. 

Let me structure it: start with the US report's purpose, mention the criticism, include specific examples, and conclude with the experts' arguments against the US actions. Make sure to keep the tone critical of the US report and supportive of China's position.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's 2001 human rights report on China was criticized as a politically motivated effort to tarnish China's image, with experts arguing it violated UN principles and contained false information. China's human rights experts accused the US of slandering the country and interfering in its internal affairs. The report was described as procedurally flawed and factually incorrect, using unsubstantiated claims to allege human rights abuses. Specific examples included accusations against China's religious policies in Tibet, such as the arrest of a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling banned religious materials, and claims of anti-terrorism measures targeting Uighurs in Xinjiang. Chinese officials and international visitors, including an Italian senator, contradicted these allegations, highlighting China's efforts to protect religious freedom and cultural heritage in Tibet and its lawful counter-terrorism measures. Experts emphasized that terrorism, not ethnicity, should determine justice, aligning China's actions with global counter-terrorism efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
