Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about the US State Department releasing their annual human rights report, specifically focusing on China. The Chinese experts are criticizing the report for being false and exaggerated, aiming to damage China's image.

I should note that the report was published last Monday, and it's the usual kind that's inaccurate about China. The experts at a seminar organized by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) are pointing out that the US is slandering China. They mention that the US has no right to interfere and is violating UN principles.

The article also discusses specific points like the US's procedural mistakes and incorrect facts. It highlights the example of Tibet, where experts say the human rights situation is improving, contrary to what the US report claims. They mention an Italian senator who praised China's efforts in Tibet.

There's a case of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles. The report criticizes China, but the China Christian Council explains that the Bibles were from a banned sect. They also mention that China prints millions of Bibles legally.

Another point is the accusation against China in Xinjiang, using anti-terrorism to target Uighurs. Chinese experts argue that terrorism, not ethnicity, is the issue and that their actions are similar to the US's approach in Afghanistan.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main criticisms, the examples from Tibet and Xinjiang, the religious freedom aspect, and the experts' rebuttals. Make sure to highlight that the US report is seen as false and politically motivated.

Let me structure it: Start with the report's publication and the criticism from China. Then mention the experts' points about UN violations. Move to specific examples like Tibet, the Italian senator, the Bible smuggling case, and the Xinjiang accusations. Conclude with the experts' stance on the report's inaccuracies.

I should keep each point brief, ensuring the summary flows logically and covers all key aspects without exceeding the word limit.
