SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by human rights experts as containing little truth and many fabrications. The report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are also incorrect, with many unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases used to illustrate its assertions. Chinese officials and experts have disputed the report's claims, citing improvements in human rights in Tibet and the protection of indigenous cultural and religious heritage. They also argue that the report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are baseless, and that China's crackdown on terrorism in Xinjiang is justified.
