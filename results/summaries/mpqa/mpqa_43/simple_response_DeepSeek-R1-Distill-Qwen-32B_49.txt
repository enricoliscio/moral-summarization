Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the US State Department's annual human rights report, specifically focusing on China. It mentions that the report contains many false claims and is aimed at damaging China's image. The Chinese experts at the CSSHR seminar criticized the US for violating UN principles by interfering in China's internal affairs.

I should highlight that the US report is seen as a tool for political pressure, not factual. The experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports and that it's against the UN Charter. They also mention that the report uses unverified stories and fabrications, like the case of Li Guangqiang, to make unfounded claims.

The article also talks about positive developments in Tibet and Xinjiang, such as improved human rights and religious freedom. It contrasts the US report's negative claims with the reality observed by foreign visitors and experts. For example, the Italian senator praised China's efforts in Tibet, and the director from Xinjiang points out that counter-terrorism efforts are just, not targeting any specific ethnic group.

I need to make sure the summary captures the criticism of the US report, the moral stance against interference, and the positive counterpoints from China's perspective. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to first mention the report's purpose, then the criticisms, and finally the counterarguments with examples.

Let me check the key points again: US report is false, aims to tarnish China, violates UN principles, uses unverified info, experts and foreign visitors contradict the claims, and China's efforts in Tibet and Xinjiang are positive. I should include these elements concisely.

Alright, I'll draft the summary now, ensuring it flows logically and sticks to the main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's annual human rights report on China was criticized by Chinese experts as a tool for political pressure, containing false claims and fabrications aimed at tarnishing China's image. At a seminar by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR), experts accused the US of violating UN principles by interfering in China's internal affairs. They argued the report's allegations, such as restrictions on religious freedom in Tibet and Xinjiang, were unsubstantiated and used to slander China. Foreign visitors, including Italian senator Renzo Gubert, praised China's progress in Tibet, noting improved human rights and religious freedom. Similarly, experts in Xinjiang emphasized that counter-terrorism efforts targeted terrorists, not ethnic groups, aligning with global counter-terrorism practices. The report's reliance on unverified stories, such as the case of Li Guangqiang, was dismissed as baseless. China's efforts to protect cultural and religious heritage, including investments in Tibet's monasteries, were highlighted as evidence of its commitment to human rights. The US report was seen as a violation of international norms, with experts asserting its purpose was to exert political pressure rather than promote human rights.
