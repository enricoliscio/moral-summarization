SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with "slandering" and "false" accusations, according to human rights experts. The report is an attempt to "tarnish" China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. Experts argue that the US has "violated" the UN spirit of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs and has "completely violated" the UN Charter. The report's claims of human rights abuses in Tibet are "blindly" accusing China of restricting religious freedom, which is contrary to the experiences of Western visitors who have seen the "ever-improving" human rights in the region. The report's use of "unsubstantiated stories" and "anecdotal evidence" to illustrate its claims is "reckless". Experts also defend China's actions in Xinjiang, saying that those who engage in terrorism should be brought to "justice", regardless of their ethnicity. END OF SUMMARY.
