SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China has been criticized by human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report was described as containing falsehoods, exaggerations, and fabrications aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts pointed out that the United States has no right to issue such a report and that it violates the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs. The report was also criticized for using unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases to support its assertions. Specific examples, such as the case of a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles and accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet, were refuted by experts and personal testimonies. The US report also accused China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which was refuted by experts who drew parallels with the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. The CSSHR seminar concluded that the US human rights report on China is biased and politically motivated.
