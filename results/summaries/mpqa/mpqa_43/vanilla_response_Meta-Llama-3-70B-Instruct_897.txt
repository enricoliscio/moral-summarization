SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by Chinese experts as containing little truth and many fabrications. The report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese government. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, violating the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are also incorrect, with many unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases used to illustrate its assertions. Chinese officials and experts, including a Tibetan professor, have disputed the report's claims on human rights in Tibet, citing improvements in the region. The report's accusations on religious freedom and crackdowns on ethnic groups have also been refuted, with Chinese authorities citing laws and regulations that have been violated.
