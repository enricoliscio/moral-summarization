SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is filled with false and absurd claims, slandering China's image and exerting political pressure on the Chinese Government. Experts say the report is unauthorized and violates the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's aim is to tarnish China's image, but it is based on incorrect and unsubstantiated stories. In reality, China has made significant improvements in human rights, particularly in Tibet, where religious freedom is protected and the local economy is developing. The report's accusations of restricting religious freedom and cracking down on ethnic groups are reckless and mistaken. China's efforts to combat terrorism are justified and analogous to the US crackdown on terrorists in Afghanistan. END OF SUMMARY.
