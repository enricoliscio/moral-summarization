SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has once again slandered and tarnished China's image with fabrications and exaggerations, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report contains many incorrect facts and uses human rights issues to exert political pressure on the Chinese government. The United States has no right to issue such a report and has violated the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs, said Jin Yongjian, a former UN deputy secretary-general. The report accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet and lists unsubstantiated incidents to support its reckless conclusion. However, experts at the seminar refuted these claims, stating that the Chinese government has made efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report also accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which Chinese experts countered by stating that the government targets terrorists, not any particular ethnic group. The US report was deemed to be full of falsehoods and to have violated the principles of protecting human rights and improving them.
END OF SUMMARY.
