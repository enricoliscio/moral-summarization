SUMMARY: The annual US State Department human rights report on China has been criticized by human rights experts and the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) as a slanderous and politically motivated document that violates the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs. The report was described as containing fabrications and exaggerations aimed at tarnishing China's image. Xirao-Nima, a Tibetan professor, refuted the report's claims about religious freedom in Tibet, citing personal experiences and testimonies from Western visitors who observed improving human rights in the region. The report's assertions about religious freedom violations were challenged, including the case of a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles, which was justified by a Chinese Christian Council representative as a legitimate action against heretical sect activity. The report also accused China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which Chinese experts refuted, drawing parallels with the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. Chinese experts asserted that terrorists, regardless of ethnicity, should face justice, condemning the US report's biased and inaccurate portrayal of China's human rights situation. END OF SUMMARY.
