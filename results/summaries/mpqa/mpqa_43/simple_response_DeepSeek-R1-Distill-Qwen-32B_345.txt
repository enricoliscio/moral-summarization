Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US State Department's human rights report on China, which the Chinese experts are criticizing as false and politically motivated. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The report is accused of fabrications and exaggerations, aiming to tarnish China's image. Experts like Xirao-Nima and Jin Yongjian are pointing out that the US is violating UN principles by interfering in China's internal affairs. They mention that the US has no authority to issue such reports and that the facts are incorrect.

There are examples given, like the case of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles. The article explains that the Bibles were from a banned sect, so his arrest was lawful. Also, the report's claims about religious freedom in Tibet and Xinjiang are contradicted by experts and international visitors who have seen improvements in these regions.

I need to make sure the summary captures the criticism of the US report, the points made by the Chinese experts, and the examples provided to back up their claims. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral stance presented in the article.

I'll start by stating that the US report is criticized for being false and politically motivated. Then mention the experts' arguments about UN violations and incorrect facts. Include the examples of Tibet and Xinjiang, highlighting the positive developments and the US's unfounded accusations. Conclude by emphasizing the Chinese experts' view that the US is interfering and that China is protecting human rights while combating terrorism.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

The report's accusations of using anti-terrorism measures against ethnic groups in Xinjiang are refuted, emphasizing that terrorism, not ethnicity, is the target.
