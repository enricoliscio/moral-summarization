Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the US State Department's annual human rights report, specifically focusing on China. The report is criticized by Chinese experts for being full of falsehoods and aimed at damaging China's image. They argue that the US is slandering China and violating UN principles by interfering in internal affairs.

The experts mention that the US report is based on unverified claims and uses terms like "credible reports" and "anecdotal evidence," which aren't reliable. They provide examples, like the case of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling Bibles of a banned sect. They also discuss the situation in Tibet, where the Chinese government is improving infrastructure and protecting cultural heritage, contrary to the US report's claims.

In Xinjiang, the report accuses China of using anti-terrorism measures against Uighurs, but experts counter that terrorism isn't tied to any specific ethnic group and that China is targeting actual terrorists, similar to the US's actions in Afghanistan.

I need to make sure the summary captures the criticism of the US report, the examples provided, and the moral arguments about interference and factual inaccuracies. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with the report's issuance and its purpose. Then mention the experts' criticism, the examples of Tibet and Xinjiang, and the moral arguments about UN principles and factual truth. Conclude with the counterpoints made by the Chinese experts.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the main arguments against the US report and the evidence provided by the Chinese side. Avoid any markdown or formatting, just plain text.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's 2001 human rights report on China was criticized by Chinese experts for containing falsehoods, exaggerations, and fabrications aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts argued that the US violated UN principles by interfering in China's internal affairs and compiling the report without UN authorization. The report was accused of using unverified claims, such as "credible reports" and "anecdotal evidence," to falsely accuse China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet and cracking down on ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the guise of anti-terrorism. Counterpoints included the example of Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman arrested for smuggling banned religious materials, and the positive development in Tibet, where infrastructure and cultural heritage were being preserved. Experts emphasized that terrorism, not ethnicity, should determine justice, aligning with the US's approach in Afghanistan. The report's accusations were deemed baseless and politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
