SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by Chinese experts as containing little truth and many fabrications. The report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese government. Experts argue that the US has no right to issue such reports, as it violates the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report is also accused of using human rights issues to slander China, with many unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases. Chinese officials and experts have countered the report's claims, citing improvements in human rights in Tibet and the protection of indigenous cultural and religious heritage. They also argue that the report's accusations of restricting religious freedom in Tibet are unfounded, and that the Chinese government has taken measures to crack down on terrorism, not target specific ethnic groups.
