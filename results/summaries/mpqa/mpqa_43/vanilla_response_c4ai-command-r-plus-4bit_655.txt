SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China has drawn criticism from human rights experts and scholars for being inaccurate, biased, and politically motivated. The report, which was released on Monday, was criticized for its aim to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese government. Experts pointed out that the report contains false information and exaggerations, and that the United States has no right to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. They also refuted specific allegations in the report, such as the claim that China restricts religious freedom in Tibet and that China is using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The experts provided evidence of the improvements in human rights in Tibet and refuted the claim that religious freedom is restricted. They also highlighted the distinction between cracking down on terrorists and targeting a specific ethnic group. The criticism underscores the contentious nature of the US State Department's human rights reports and the need for a more objective and unbiased assessment of human rights practices. END OF SUMMARY.
