SUMMARY:

The US State Department's annual human rights report on China is filled with falsehoods, exaggerations, and fabrications, according to human rights experts. The report aims to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government. The experts argue that the US has no right to issue such a report, as it violates the UN spirit of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. The report's facts are also incorrect, with many unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases used to illustrate its assertions. The report's accusations of China restricting religious freedom in Tibet are contradicted by Western visitors who have seen the improving human rights situation in the region. Similarly, the report's claims of China cracking down on ethnic groups in Xinjiang are misguided, as the government is simply combating terrorism and separatism. The experts conclude that the US report is a politically motivated attempt to slander China.
