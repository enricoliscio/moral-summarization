Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the US State Department's human rights report on China, which the Chinese experts are criticizing. They argue that the report is filled with exaggerations and fabrications, aiming to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. The author uses words like "truth," "exaggerations," "fabrications," "tarnish," and "slandering," which I need to include.

I should identify the key points: the report's intent to slander, the experts' arguments about UN violations, the examples from Tibet and Xinjiang, and the counterarguments from Chinese officials. I need to make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral issues the author emphasizes.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the report and its intent, then the experts' criticisms, followed by specific examples like Tibet's improvements and the case of Li Guangqiang. I'll also touch on the Xinjiang situation and the comparison to US actions in Afghanistan.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it's concise. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words without making it sound too negative or biased. It's important to present both the US report's claims and the Chinese counterarguments clearly.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each paragraph isn't too long and that the key moral points are highlighted. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure all the specified words are included where appropriate.

SUMMARY:  
The US State Department's 2001 human rights report on China was criticized for containing exaggerations, fabrications, and falsehoods, aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts argued that the report slanders China and violates UN principles, as the US has no right to compile or release such documents. The report was accused of using unsubstantiated stories to accuse China of restricting religious freedom and rights in Tibet and Xinjiang.  

Chinese officials highlighted the ever-improving human rights conditions in Tibet, citing investments in cultural preservation and religious freedom. For instance, the Potala Palace received significant funding for repair and safety updates. Meanwhile, the report's claim that China restricts religious freedom was contradicted by the availability of Bibles and the legal crackdown on smuggled heretical materials.  

In Xinjiang, the report accused China of using anti-terrorism efforts to target ethnic groups, but experts argued that terrorism, not ethnicity, should determine justice. The US was criticized for legitimizing measures against specific groups, mirroring its actions in Afghanistan. Overall, the report was seen as a false narrative, with experts emphasizing the need to protect human rights through truthful and unbiased reporting.  
END OF SUMMARY.
