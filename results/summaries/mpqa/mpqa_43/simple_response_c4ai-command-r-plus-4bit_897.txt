SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China is full of falsehoods and exaggerations aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report contains many unsubstantiated claims and uses phrases like "according to credible reports" to create a false impression of legitimacy. For example, it accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet, when in reality the Chinese government has made significant efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report also criticizes China's arrest of a Hong Kong businessman charged with smuggling Bibles, despite his violation of Chinese law and involvement with a banned heretical sect. Furthermore, the report accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to target ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is analogous to the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. The CSSHR seminar concluded that the US report is a politically motivated attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and violates the UN spirit of non-interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
