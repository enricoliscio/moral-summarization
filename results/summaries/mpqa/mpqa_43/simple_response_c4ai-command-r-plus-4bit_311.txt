SUMMARY: The annual US State Department human rights report on China is full of falsehoods and exaggerations, with the aim of tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report contains unsubstantiated stories and uses phrases like "according to credible reports" to back up its assertions. For example, it accuses China of arresting a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles, when in fact he was violating Chinese law by distributing heretical texts. The report also accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which is analogous to the US crackdown on Muslim terrorists in Afghanistan. Chinese officials and experts have refuted the report, stating that it violates the UN spirit of non-interference and that the US has no right to issue such reports. They also point out the improvements in human rights in Tibet, which have been recognized by Western visitors, including an Italian senator who praised the protection of cultural and religious heritage in the region. CSSHR President Zhou Jue said that while the report softens its tone, it still uses human rights issues to slander China. The seminar concluded that the US human rights report on China is politically motivated and lacks credibility.
