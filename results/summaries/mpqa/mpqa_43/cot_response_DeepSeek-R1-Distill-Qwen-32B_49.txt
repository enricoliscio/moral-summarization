Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main tasks: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "tarnish," "slander," "fabrications," "violate," "interfere," "procedural mistake," "falsehoods," "unwarranted," "restrict," "ban," "heresy," "oppress," "legitimize," "terrorist," "crackdown," "unjust," and "oppression" stand out as they convey moral judgment.

Next, I'll craft a summary that includes these words. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the article's critical stance towards the US report on China. I'll highlight how the report is seen as misleading, violating international norms, and based on false claims. I'll also mention the experts' and officials' responses, emphasizing China's efforts in human rights and religious freedom, as well as the criticism of the US's approach in Xinjiang.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first state the report's intent, then discuss the experts' criticisms, provide examples like Tibet and Xinjiang, and conclude with the counterarguments from Chinese officials and international perspectives.

**SUMMARY:**  

The US State Department's annual human rights report on China was criticized for its misleading content, aiming to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure. Experts argued that the report, which includes fabrications and exaggerations, violates UN principles and interferes in China's internal affairs. China's human rights record, particularly in Tibet, was defended, with experts citing improvements in religious freedom and economic development. The report's claims of restricted religious freedom in Tibet were dismissed as false, with examples like the smuggling of banned "Shouters" Bibles highlighted. Similarly, the report's accusations against China's counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang were criticized, with experts stating that targeting terrorists, regardless of ethnicity, is justifiable. The US report was seen as an attempt to slander China, using unsubstantiated claims to justify its narrative. END OF SUMMARY.
