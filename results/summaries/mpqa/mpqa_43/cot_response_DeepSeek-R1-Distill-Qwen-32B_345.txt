Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the US State Department's report on China, which is described as containing "absurdities, exaggerations, and fabrications." So those are definitely morally framed words. The report's aim is to "tarnish China's image" and exert "political pressure." Those are strong terms showing disapproval.

Experts at the CSSHR seminar criticized the US for "slandering" China and violating the UN's principle of non-interference. "Violation" and "slandering" are moral terms. The report is called "false," and the US is accused of "slandering" China again. 

Jin Yongjian mentions the US violating the UN Charter and international principles, so "violated" is another moral term. The report is said to have "procedural mistakes" and incorrect facts, which implies it's unfair or deceptive.

Zhou Jue says the US softens its tone but still uses human rights issues to "slander" China. Xirao-Nima mentions seeing the "truth" in Tibet, contrasting with US politicians' "ulterior motives." That's another moral point.

Westerners, like Renzo Gubert, praise China's efforts in Tibet, highlighting "improving human rights." The report uses "unsubstantiated stories" and "doubtful phrases," showing it's based on lies. The case of Li Guangqiang is presented as a "reckless conclusion," implying the report is irresponsible.

The report also accuses China of using anti-terrorism to target Uighurs, which Ma Dazheng calls a "mistake." He argues that terrorism, not ethnicity, should be the focus, comparing it to the US targeting terrorists in Afghanistan, not Muslims.

So, compiling all these, the summary needs to include these moral terms to reflect the author's framing. I'll make sure to highlight the US's actions as slanderous, false, and violating international principles, while showing China's positive efforts in Tibet and Xinjiang.
