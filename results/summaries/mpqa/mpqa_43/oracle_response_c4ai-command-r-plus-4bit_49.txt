SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China has been criticized by human rights experts for its lack of truth and abundance of exaggerations, fabrications, and slanderous claims aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure on the Chinese government. The report violates the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs and contains incorrect facts. Chinese officials and experts refute the report's accusations, highlighting the improving human rights situation in Tibet and the protection of religious freedom for local Tibetans. The report's conclusion is reckless and based on unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases. Accusations of Bible smuggling and restricting religious freedom in Tibet are refuted by a Christian council member, who states that the Bibles in question were heretical translations by a banned sect. China's anti-terrorism campaigns in Xinjiang are also criticized in the report, with US politicians accused of misrepresenting terrorists as a particular ethnic group. Chinese experts assert that terrorism should be condemned regardless of ethnicity, just as the US condemns Al-Qaida and the Taliban despite their Muslim identity. The report's release and compilation violate UN principles, and its contents are an attempt to slander and exert pressure on China.
END OF SUMMARY.
