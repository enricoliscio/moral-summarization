SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is riddled with absurdities, exaggerations, and fabrications, according to human rights experts. The report aims to malign China and exert political pressure on its government by making false accusations of human rights violations. The report violates the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs and accuses China of restricting religious freedom and cracking down on ethnic groups under the guise of anti-terrorism. However, experts refute these claims, stating that the US has no right to issue such reports and that the facts presented are incorrect and morally wrong. They highlight that the report uses unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases to back its reckless conclusions. The report's accusation of arresting a Hong Kong businessman for smuggling Bibles is refuted by a Christian council member who states that the smuggled Bibles were heretical translations by a banned sect. Experts also refute the claim that China is targeting Muslim Uighur activists under the anti-terrorism umbrella, stating that the crackdown is on terrorists, not any particular ethnic group. The US's double standards in its own anti-terrorism campaigns in Afghanistan are highlighted. The report's intention to tarnish China's image and interfere in its internal affairs is evident, and experts call for a more objective and truthful assessment of human rights practices. END OF SUMMARY.
