SUMMARY: The annual US State Department report on human rights practices in China has once again slandered and tarnished China's image with fabrications and exaggerations, according to human rights experts at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR). The report violates the UN principle of non-interference in internal affairs and contains many unsubstantiated stories and doubtful phrases to back up its reckless conclusions. For example, the report accuses China of arresting Li Guangqiang, a Hong Kong businessman who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country. However, Rev Cao Shengjie of the China Christian Council refuted this claim, stating that the smuggled Bibles were heretical translations by a banned sect. The report also falsely claims that China restricts religious freedom in Tibet, which is contradicted by the observations of Italian senator Renzo Gubert, who praised China's efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. The report further accuses China of using anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which Chinese experts refute as a mistake in equating terrorism with any particular ethnic group. The US report violates the UN Charter and relevant international principles with its incorrect facts and biased framing, and seeks to exert political pressure on China. 

END OF SUMMARY.
