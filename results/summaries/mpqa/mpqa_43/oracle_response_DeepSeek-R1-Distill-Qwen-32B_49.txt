Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the US State Department's human rights report on China, which the author criticizes for being false and biased. Experts from China argue that the report slanders China, violates UN principles, and uses incorrect facts. They provide examples like Tibet's development, religious freedom, and counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang to counter the US claims.

Now, I need to identify the key points and the moral terms used. The report is seen as tarnishing China's image, slandering, and fabricating information. The US is accused of violating UN principles and using human rights issues to exert political pressure. The article also highlights China's efforts in protecting culture, improving human rights, and countering terrorism without targeting specific ethnic groups.

I'll structure the summary by addressing each main point: the US report's purpose, the criticism from Chinese experts, examples of Tibet and Xinjiang, and the refutation of the US claims. I'll make sure to use the provided moral words like 'tarnish,''slandering,' 'fabrications,' 'truth,' 'protect,' 'developing,' 'freedom,' etc.

I should keep each sentence concise and stick to the main arguments. I'll avoid adding any new information not in the article. Also, I need to ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral terms without making it too wordy. I'll check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved accurately.

SUMMARY: The US State Department's annual human rights report on China was criticized for containing exaggerations, fabrications, and falsehoods, aimed at tarnishing China's image and exerting political pressure. Experts argued the report slanders China, violating UN principles and the spirit of non-interference in internal affairs. The report's claims of human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang were dismissed as incorrect and unfounded. China's efforts to protect cultural heritage and improve human rights in Tibet, such as investing in monasteries and religious freedom, were highlighted. The report's accusation of restricting religious freedom was contradicted by examples like the legal printing of Bibles and the protection of religious practices. In Xinjiang, China's counter-terrorism measures were defended as targeting terrorism, not ethnic groups, similar to the US approach in Afghanistan. The report was seen as using human rights issues to slander China, with its unsubstantiated claims and false truths. END OF SUMMARY.
