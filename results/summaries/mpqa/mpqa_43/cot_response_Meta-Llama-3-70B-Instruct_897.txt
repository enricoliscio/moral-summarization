SUMMARY:
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices in China is accused of containing "false" and "absurd" claims, aimed at "slandering" China's image and exerting political pressure. Human rights experts argue that the report "violates" the UN spirit of non-interference in internal affairs and is "unauthorized" by the UN Charter. The report is said to "exaggerate" and "fabricate" human rights issues in Tibet, where the Chinese government has made efforts to protect indigenous cultural and religious heritage. Italian senator Renzo Gubert praised the government's efforts, saying that local Tibetans enjoy a high level of religious freedom. The report is criticized for using "unsubstantiated" stories and "doubtful" phrases to make "reckless" conclusions. Experts argue that the report's accusations of restricting religious freedom and cracking down on ethnic groups are "blind" and "mistaken".
