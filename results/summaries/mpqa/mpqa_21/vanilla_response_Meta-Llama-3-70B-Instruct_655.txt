SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has already taken steps towards a cooler future. The study found that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. The researchers attribute this slowdown to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. If emissions had continued to rise at the peak rate reached in 1980, temperatures by 2050 would have reached levels not expected until 2100. The study also notes that reducing emissions of methane and other pollutants, such as black carbon soot and ozone, could have a significant impact on the climate. In fact, a 30% reduction in methane emissions could have a comparable effect to the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. The study suggests that policymakers should consider attacking these other pollutants as a way to make progress on climate change.
