SUMMARY:
A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world is on a path to a cooler future, thanks to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The protocol's phase-out of ozone-depleting gases, which also trap heat, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. This slowdown is a significant step towards a cooler future, and is partly due to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide. The researchers argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach is a more effective way to adjust the globe's thermostat, rather than relying solely on curbs on CO2, which are often politically charged and would require significant curbs on burning coal, oil, and natural gas - the fuels of booming economies.
