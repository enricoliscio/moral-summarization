Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally framed words as possible, which are: implementation, agreed, phase, conducted, effort, adjusting, attacking. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how the Montreal Protocol has helped slow down greenhouse gas emissions, which has had a positive effect on reducing global warming. The study by NASA researchers shows that by phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, which are potent greenhouse gases, the world has avoided some of the projected temperature increases. They also suggest that focusing on other pollutants like methane and black carbon could be more effective than just cutting CO2, especially since reducing CO2 affects economic activities.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with the key findings: the slowdown in temperature growth due to the Montreal Protocol. Then mention the researchers and their study. Highlight the moral terms like implementation, agreed, phase, conducted, effort, adjusting, attacking. 

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while including those terms. I'll make sure to connect the actions taken (implementation, phase) with the results, and mention the alternative approaches (attacking other pollutants) as part of the effort to adjust global efforts against climate change.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately placed. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Finally, I'll review to ensure clarity and that all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights the positive impact of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which aimed to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These gases, while also potent greenhouse gases, were successfully reduced through international agreement and implementation, slowing the growth of global warming. The study, conducted by James Hansen and Makiko Sato, shows that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have delayed potential temperature increases by decades. The researchers emphasize that this slowdown is due in part to reduced methane and carbon dioxide growth, though the exact reasons remain unclear. They argue that policymakers should focus on adjusting global efforts to address other pollutants, such as methane and black carbon soot, as these could have a significant impact on climate change comparable to the reductions envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. By attacking these pollutants, the study suggests, the world could achieve meaningful progress without solely relying on curbing carbon dioxide emissions, which are tied to economic activities like fossil fuel use.
