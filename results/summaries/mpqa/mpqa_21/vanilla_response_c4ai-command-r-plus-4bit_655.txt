SUMMARY: A study by researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies suggests that the world has already begun to slow the rate of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers found that the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which targeted ozone-depleting gases, has played a key role in this slowdown as these gases are also potent heat-trapping agents. The study also highlights the importance of addressing other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, which can have a significant impact on the climate. The researchers argue that reducing these pollutants can be as effective as curbing carbon dioxide emissions, the main focus of the Kyoto Protocol. According to the study, the rate at which the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability is increasing has slowed, potentially avoiding more extreme temperature increases by 2050. The findings offer insights into alternative approaches to mitigating climate change beyond solely focusing on CO2 reduction.
