SUMMARY: As the world prepares for discussions on ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a NASA study reveals that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are already having a positive impact. The study found that declining emissions since the late 1980s, due in part to the Montreal Protocol's phase-out of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, have slowed the rate at which the Earth's atmosphere traps heat. This slowdown is also attributed to the decrease in methane and carbon dioxide emissions, although the reasons for this are less clear. The researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, suggest that increased carbon dioxide uptake by plants and marine life may be a factor. They advocate for a broader approach to mitigating climate change, targeting pollutants like methane and black carbon soot, which can have a significant impact on the climate without requiring reductions in the use of fossil fuels, the lifeblood of many economies. Their work offers a glimmer of hope that the world is taking steps to avoid the most catastrophic outcomes of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
