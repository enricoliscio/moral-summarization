SUMMARY:

A recent NASA study reveals that the world has taken a crucial step towards a cooler future by slowing down the growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, has contributed significantly to this slowdown. If the pre-1987 rate of increase had continued, the climate would have reached alarming temperatures by 2050, equivalent to those anticipated for 2100. The researchers suggest that policymakers should focus on reducing pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which can have a comparable impact on climate change as curbing CO2 emissions. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, for example, the effect on climate would be similar to the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This study highlights the importance of a multifaceted approach to combat climate change, emphasizing that it's not just about CO2, but about addressing the broader range of pollutants contributing to global warming.
