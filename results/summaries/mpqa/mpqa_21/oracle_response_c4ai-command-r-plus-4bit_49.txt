SUMMARY: As nations prepare for discussions surrounding the ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals a promising development: a decline in greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s has slowed the rate at which the Earth's atmosphere traps heat. This positive development is attributed to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which are also potent heat-trapping gases. The NASA researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato, suggest that the slowdown is also due to the unexplained slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide. They advocate for a broader approach to adjusting the Earth's thermostat, "attacking" pollutants like methane and black carbon soot, in addition to carbon dioxide, the main focus of the Kyoto Protocol. Their efforts suggest that significant progress can be made by reducing methane emissions, with effects comparable to those envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. The study was conducted with moral responsibility and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, providing valuable insights into potential paths for mitigating climate change.
