Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified a two-step process: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and then writing a concise summary using those terms.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "battles," "phase out," "protective," "erode," "traps," "curbing," "booming," "headway," "curbs," "commitment," "envisioned," "pledge," and "pledge." These words seem to carry moral weight as they relate to actions, responsibilities, and impacts on the environment and society.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words, ensuring the moral terms are included. The article discusses a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, partly due to the Montreal Protocol. It contrasts this with the Kyoto Protocol's focus on CO2 and suggests alternative strategies like reducing methane and soot. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, such as the effectiveness of past agreements and the potential of alternative approaches to mitigate climate change without relying solely on CO2 reductions.

I should structure the summary to first mention the study's findings, then the implications of the Montreal Protocol, contrast with Kyoto, and conclude with the suggested alternatives and their moral benefits. Keeping it concise while retaining the key moral points is crucial.

**SUMMARY:**  
A recent study by NASA researchers highlights how global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have slowed the rate of climate change, partly due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These gases, though less abundant than carbon dioxide, trap heat thousands of times more effectively. The slowdown in greenhouse gas growth could also result from increased CO2 uptake by plants and marine organisms, though the exact reasons remain unclear. The researchers argue that policymakers should focus on curbing other pollutants, such as methane and black carbon soot, which could yield significant climate benefits without the political challenges of reducing CO2. Their findings suggest that cutting methane emissions by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to the reductions envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach offers a promising alternative to the politically charged battle over CO2 reductions, emphasizing the need for a broader strategy to protect the planet.
