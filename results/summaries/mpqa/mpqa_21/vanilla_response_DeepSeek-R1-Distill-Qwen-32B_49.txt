Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a study by NASA researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato. They found that greenhouse gas emissions have been declining since the late 1980s, which has slowed the rate at which the atmosphere retains heat. This is partly because of the Montreal Protocol, which phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that damage the ozone layer. CFCs also trap heat much more effectively than CO2. 

The study suggests that if emissions had continued at the 1980 peak, temperatures would have risen much faster, reaching levels expected in 2100 by 2050. There's also a slower growth in methane and CO2, but the reasons aren't clear. The researchers think it might be due to plants and oceans absorbing more CO2.

Hansen and Sato argue that instead of just focusing on CO2, as the Kyoto Protocol does, policymakers should also target other pollutants like black carbon, ozone, and methane. They say reducing methane by 30% could have a similar climate effect as the Kyoto cuts. Their study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in December 2001.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the study, the decline in emissions, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the impact on future temperatures, the slower growth of methane and CO2, and the researchers' suggestion to target other pollutants. I'll make sure to include the key points and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: A study by NASA researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato highlights that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the atmosphere's heat retention, partly due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These CFCs are potent heat-trappers. If emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures expected by 2100 would have been reached by 2050. The slower growth of methane and CO2 is partially due to increased uptake by plants and oceans. The researchers suggest targeting other pollutants like black carbon, ozone, and methane, arguing that a 30% methane reduction could match Kyoto Protocol CO2 cuts. Their findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in December 2001. END OF SUMMARY.
