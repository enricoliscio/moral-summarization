SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has taken a step towards a cooler future, thanks to the decline in greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. This slowdown has prevented a potential temperature increase that would have occurred by 2050, had the rate of greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise at its peak level. The study's authors, Drs. Hansen and Sato, argue that policymakers can make significant progress in combating climate change by targeting other pollutants, such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, rather than solely focusing on carbon dioxide. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach offers a more pragmatic and effective way to address the pressing issue of climate change.
