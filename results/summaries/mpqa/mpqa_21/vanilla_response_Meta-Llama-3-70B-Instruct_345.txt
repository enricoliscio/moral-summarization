SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has already taken steps towards a cooler future. The study found that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. The researchers attribute this slowdown to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had continued at its peak, the climate would have reached temperatures by 2050 that are currently not anticipated until 2100. The study also suggests that policymakers can make significant progress by targeting other pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which could have a comparable effect on climate as cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol.
