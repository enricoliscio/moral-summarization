Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about how greenhouse gas emissions have declined since the late 80s, slowing the rate at which the atmosphere retains heat. This is linked to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. The study suggests that without this slowdown, temperatures would have risen much faster.

The researchers, Hansen and Sato, argue that focusing only on CO2, as Kyoto does, might not be the only way. They suggest targeting other pollutants like methane and soot, which could have a significant impact. The article emphasizes the effectiveness of these alternatives and the potential benefits of such policies.

Now, for the moral framing. I need to identify words that carry moral weight. Words like "phase out," "erode," "protective," "curbing," "booming," "headway," "significant," "comparable," "commitment," "envisioned," "benefits," "alternatives," "effective," "impact," "potential," "urgency," and "action" seem to carry moral connotations.

In the summary, I should include these words to maintain the original moral perspective. I'll focus on the positive impact of the Montreal Protocol, the effectiveness of targeting other pollutants, and the call for comprehensive action beyond just CO2.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and flows naturally while including the morally framed words. Let me structure it step by step, highlighting the key points and the moral implications.

**SUMMARY:**

A recent study by NASA researchers highlights the positive impact of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, also effective at trapping heat. This protocol has slowed the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, potentially delaying significant temperature increases. The researchers argue that focusing solely on CO2, as in the Kyoto Protocol, may not be the only solution. They suggest targeting pollutants like methane and soot could yield comparable benefits to Kyoto's goals. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, the climate impact could match Kyoto's first commitment period. This study underscores the potential of alternative strategies to combat climate change, emphasizing the need for comprehensive action beyond CO2 reduction. END OF SUMMARY.
