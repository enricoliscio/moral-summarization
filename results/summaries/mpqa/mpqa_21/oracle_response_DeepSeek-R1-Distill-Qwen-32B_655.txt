Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user mentioned that the assistant should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The key here is to focus on the morally framed words the author used: implementation, agreed, phase, conducted, effort, adjusting, attacking.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have declined since the late 1980s, slowing the rate of global warming. This is partly due to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases. These gases also trap heat, so their reduction has a cooling effect. The study suggests that without this, temperatures would have risen much faster. The researchers also mention slower growth in methane and CO2, though the reasons aren't clear. They argue that policymakers should target other pollutants besides CO2, like black carbon and methane, which could have significant climate benefits.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I should include the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, "implementation" when talking about the Montreal Protocol, "agreed" when referring to the phase-out, "conducted" for the study, "effort" for the policy actions, "adjusting" the thermostat, and "attacking" pollutants.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the study's findings, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the potential of targeting other pollutants, and the implications for climate policy. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft this out, ensuring I include all the key points and the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have slowed the rate of climate change, partly due to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This agreement, in which countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), also reduced heat-trapping gases. The study, conducted by James Hansen and Makiko Sato, shows that without this slowdown, global temperatures could have risen much faster by 2050. The researchers emphasize that the slower growth in methane and CO2 concentrations, though not fully understood, may be linked to increased uptake by plants and marine organisms. They argue that policymakers should focus on adjusting climate strategies beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol, which targets CO2. Instead, they suggest attacking other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which could yield significant climate benefits. For example, reducing methane emissions by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to Kyoto's CO2 reduction goals. The study underscores the importance of targeting multiple pollutants to address global warming effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
