Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article talks about how global efforts, specifically the Montreal Protocol, have led to a slowdown in the growth of greenhouse gases, which in turn has slowed down the increase in global temperatures. The author uses words like "implementation," "agreed," "phase," "conducted," "effort," "adjusting," and "attacking" to frame the actions taken by countries and researchers.

First, I should identify the key points: the slowdown in greenhouse gas growth, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the impact of chlorofluorocarbons, and the researchers' suggestion to target other pollutants besides CO2. I need to make sure to include the moral framing words in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the study from NASA's Goddard Institute, highlighting the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Then, I'll note the effect of chlorofluorocarbons and how their phase-out contributed to the slowdown. Next, I'll discuss the researchers' findings about methane and CO2, and their suggestion to attack other pollutants. I'll end by summarizing their argument about the potential impact of reducing methane.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well, connecting each point logically while preserving the moral language. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA's Goddard Institute highlights that global efforts, particularly the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, have slowed the growth of greenhouse gases, contributing to a cooler future than anticipated. The protocol, which involved countries agreeing to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), also reduced heat-trapping gases. Researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato note that slower growth in methane and CO2, though not fully understood, may be due to increased uptake by plants and marine organisms. Their work, conducted as part of a broader effort to explore alternatives to the politically charged Kyoto Protocol, suggests that adjusting global climate strategies could focus on attacking other pollutants like black carbon soot and methane. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, the climate impact could match Kyoto's CO2 reduction goals. This approach offers a potential path forward in the ongoing battle against climate change.
