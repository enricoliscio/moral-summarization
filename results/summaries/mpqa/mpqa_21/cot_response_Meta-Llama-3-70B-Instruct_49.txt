SUMMARY:
A recent NASA study suggests that the world has taken a step in the right direction towards a cooler future, thanks to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The protocol's phase-out of ozone-depleting gases, which also trap heat, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. This slowdown is a significant development, as it would have taken until 2100 to reach the temperatures anticipated by 2050 if the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had continued unchecked. The study's authors, Drs. Hansen and Sato, argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach is a more responsible way to address climate change, as it doesn't rely solely on curbing CO2 emissions, which would mean curbing the use of fuels that drive booming economies.
