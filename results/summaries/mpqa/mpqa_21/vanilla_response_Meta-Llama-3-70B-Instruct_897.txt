SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies suggests that the world has already taken steps towards a cooler future. The researchers found that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. This slowdown is attributed to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out production of ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. The study also notes that the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide has contributed to this trend. The researchers argue that policymakers can make significant progress by targeting other pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, rather than solely focusing on carbon dioxide. For example, reducing methane emissions by 30% could have a comparable effect on the climate as the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol.
