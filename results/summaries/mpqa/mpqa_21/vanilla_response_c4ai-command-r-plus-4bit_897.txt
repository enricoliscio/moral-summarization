SUMMARY: Researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) have found that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the rate at which the atmosphere traps heat. This slowdown is attributed in part to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that are also potent heat-trapping agents. The study, conducted by James Hansen and Makiko Sato of GISS, suggests that the world is on a path to a cooler future than previously anticipated. They also highlight the importance of addressing other pollutants such as methane and black carbon soot, which have a significant impact on the climate. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the climate benefits would be similar to those envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol during its first commitment period. The researchers argue that focusing solely on carbon dioxide, as the Kyoto Protocol does, may not be the most effective approach to mitigating climate change. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in December 2001. END OF SUMMARY.
