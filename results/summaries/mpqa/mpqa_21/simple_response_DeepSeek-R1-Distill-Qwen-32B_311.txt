Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying message.

The article talks about a study from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. They found that greenhouse gas emissions have declined since the late 1980s, slowing the increase in the atmosphere's heat retention. This is partly due to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat more effectively than CO2. The study suggests that if emissions had continued at the 1980 peak, temperatures would have risen much faster.

The researchers, Hansen and Sato, also mention slower growth in methane and CO2, though the reasons aren't clear. They suggest that increased uptake by plants and marine organisms might be a factor. The article emphasizes that the Kyoto Protocol focuses on CO2, which is tied to fossil fuels and economic growth. However, the researchers argue that targeting other pollutants like black carbon and methane could be more effective and politically feasible.

The moral framing here seems to highlight the success of international agreements like the Montreal Protocol and the potential for alternative strategies to combat climate change. The authors are suggesting that reducing other pollutants might be a better approach than just focusing on CO2, which is politically challenging because it affects economic activities.

So, the summary should capture these points: the slowing of greenhouse gas growth, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the focus on CO2 in Kyoto, and the alternative strategies proposed by the researchers. It should also convey the moral message about the effectiveness of international cooperation and alternative solutions.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key findings and the moral implications. I'll structure it to first present the study's findings, then discuss the implications and alternative approaches, and conclude with the moral lesson about the benefits of targeting different pollutants.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies highlights that global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through the 1987 Montreal Protocol, have slowed the rate of atmospheric heat retention. The protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, also reduced potent heat-trapping gases. Researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato note that if emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures would have risen much faster, reaching 2100 levels by 2050. The slower growth in methane and CO2 remains partially unexplained, though increased uptake by plants and marine organisms may play a role. The study suggests that targeting pollutants like black carbon soot and methane could offer a politically feasible alternative to the Kyoto Protocol's focus on CO2, which ties closely to fossil fuel use and economic growth. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, the climate impact could match Kyoto's CO2 reduction goals. The research underscores the potential for addressing climate change through less contentious strategies, emphasizing the moral and practical benefits of targeting alternative pollutants.
