Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a study from NASA's Goddard Institute. They found that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed since the late 80s, which has reduced the rate of global warming. That's interesting because it's not just about the Kyoto Protocol, but also the Montreal Protocol, which phased out CFCs. Those CFCs were bad for the ozone and also potent greenhouse gases. 

So, the key points are: the slowdown in emissions, the role of the Montreal Protocol, and the focus on other pollutants like methane and black carbon. The study suggests that targeting these could be as effective as reducing CO2, which is the main focus of Kyoto. The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I need to condense this info clearly. I'll make sure to mention the study's findings, the impact of the Montreal Protocol, and the alternative strategies for combating climate change. Also, I should highlight that while CO2 is a major focus, other gases can play a significant role too. Let me structure this into a concise summary, ensuring all main points are covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) indicates that global warming has slowed due to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. This slowdown is partly attributed to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), also potent greenhouse gases. If emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures could have risen to 2100 levels by 2050. Researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato also note slower growth in methane and CO2, possibly due to increased absorption by plants and oceans. The study suggests that targeting pollutants like methane, black carbon soot, and ozone could offer significant climate benefits, comparable to CO2 reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. This approach could provide an alternative to politically contentious CO2-focused measures. END OF SUMMARY.
