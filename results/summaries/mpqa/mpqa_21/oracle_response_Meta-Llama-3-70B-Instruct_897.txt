SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato suggests that the world has taken a significant step towards a cooler future. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions. This effort has led to a decline in emissions since the late 1980s, which in turn has slowed the rate of global warming. The researchers conducted a study that shows if the current rate of increase in greenhouse gases continues, the climate by 2050 would be cooler than previously anticipated. The study also highlights the importance of attacking other pollutants such as methane, ozone, and black carbon soot, which can have a significant impact on the climate. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, for example, the effect on the climate would be comparable to the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This effort to adjust the globe's thermostat offers a promising path forward.
