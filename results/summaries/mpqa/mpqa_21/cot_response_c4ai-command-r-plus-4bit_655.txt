SUMMARY: As countries prepare for battles over ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a study suggests that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have already had a positive impact on slowing the growth of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. The Montreal Protocol, implemented in 1987, is credited for the decline in emissions since it targeted chlorofluorocarbons, potent heat-trapping gases. By 2050, temperatures are expected to be cooler than previously anticipated due to this slowdown. The study also highlights the unclear reasons for the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, with NASA researcher James Hansen suggesting increased uptake by land-based plants and marine life as a potential factor. Hansen and his colleague Makiko Sato advocate for a broader approach beyond the politically charged focus on carbon dioxide in the Kyoto Protocol. They argue that significant progress can be made by curbing other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. The duo calculates that reducing methane emissions by 30 percent could have comparable effects to the envisioned cuts in CO2 under the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. Their work underscores the potential for alternative paths to adjusting the globe's thermostat and mitigating the impacts of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
