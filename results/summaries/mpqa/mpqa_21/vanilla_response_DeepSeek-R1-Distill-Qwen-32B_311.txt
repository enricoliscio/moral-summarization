Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The main points seem to be about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, which is cooling the planet more than expected. They link this to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. The article mentions that without this slowdown, temperatures would have risen faster. They also suggest that methane and CO2 growth slowed for unknown reasons, possibly due to increased plant uptake. The researchers propose targeting other pollutants like soot and methane instead of just CO2 to combat climate change, as cutting CO2 affects economic growth. Their study was published in a scientific journal.

Okay, so the summary should cover the study's findings, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the slower growth of greenhouse gases, and the alternative approach to reducing emissions. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the key points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: A study by NASA researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato indicates that global temperatures are rising more slowly than previously anticipated, partly due to reduced greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. This slowdown is linked to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that also trap heat. If emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures projected for 2100 would have been reached by 2050. The researchers also note slower growth in methane and CO2, possibly due to increased absorption by plants and marine life. They suggest targeting other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane from industrial activities as an alternative to focusing solely on CO2 reduction, which impacts economic growth. Their findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. END OF SUMMARY.
