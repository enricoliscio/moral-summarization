SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has already taken a step towards a cooler future due to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The study links this slowdown to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had continued, the climate would have reached temperatures by 2050 that are currently not expected until 2100. The study also notes that the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, possibly due to increased CO2 uptake by plants and marine organisms, has contributed to the slowdown. The researchers argue that policymakers can make significant progress by targeting other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which could have a comparable impact on the climate as CO2 cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol.
