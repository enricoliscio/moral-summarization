SUMMARY: Researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) have found that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. The decrease in emissions is attributed to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which targeted gases that deplete the ozone layer. The slowdown is also due to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, the reasons for which are not yet fully understood. The study suggests that policymakers can effectively combat climate change by targeting pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, in addition to carbon dioxide, the primary focus of the Kyoto Protocol. According to the researchers, reducing methane emissions by 30 percent would have a comparable effect on the climate as the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol during its first commitment period. The work highlights potential alternatives to curbing the use of fossil fuels, which is a politically sensitive issue. The study was conducted by James Hansen and Makiko Sato of GISS and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in December 2001.
