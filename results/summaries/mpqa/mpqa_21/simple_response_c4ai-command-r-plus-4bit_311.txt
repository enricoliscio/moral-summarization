SUMMARY: As the world prepares for the Kyoto Protocol, a NASA study reveals a slowdown in global warming. The study attributes this to the Montreal Protocol, which targeted ozone-depleting gases that are also potent heat-trapping agents. The Montreal Protocol's success in reducing these gases has bought the world time in the fight against climate change. The researchers also highlight the importance of tackling other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, which have a significant impact on the climate. They argue that reducing methane emissions by 30% would have a comparable effect to the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. This study underscores the importance of global efforts to curb climate change and demonstrates that progress can be made through targeting a range of greenhouse gases and pollutants, not just carbon dioxide. It offers a glimmer of hope that the worst-case scenarios of future warming may be avoided if countries continue to take meaningful action. END OF SUMMARY.
