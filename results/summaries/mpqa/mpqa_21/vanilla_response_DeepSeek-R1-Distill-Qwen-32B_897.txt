Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed since the late 1980s. They attribute this to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. These gases are more potent than CO2, so their reduction has a significant cooling effect. The study suggests that without this slowdown, temperatures would have risen much faster.

The article also mentions that the slower growth in CO2 might be due to more plant and marine uptake. The researchers propose targeting other pollutants like methane and black carbon instead of just focusing on CO2, as cutting CO2 would hinder economic growth. They argue that reducing methane by 30% could have the same impact as the Kyoto Protocol's CO2 cuts.

I should make sure the summary includes the key points: the study's findings, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the effect on temperature projections, the possible reasons for CO2 slowdown, and the alternative pollutants to target. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and flows well.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights that global greenhouse gas emissions have slowed since the late 1980s, partly due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These gases, though potent heat trappers, were reduced, slowing the rate of global warming. Without this reduction, temperatures could have risen faster, delaying the expected doubling of CO2 concentrations until 2100. The study also notes slower methane and CO2 growth, possibly due to increased absorption by plants and oceans. Researchers argue that targeting pollutants like methane and black carbon could offer significant climate benefits without the economic challenges of reducing CO2, as seen in the Kyoto Protocol.
