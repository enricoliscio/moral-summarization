Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a study by NASA researchers that shows the world is heading towards a cooler future than expected. They mention that since the late 1980s, greenhouse gas emissions have declined, slowing the growth of the atmosphere's heat retention. This is linked to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat more effectively than CO2. 

So, the main points are: 
1. Declining greenhouse gases since the late 1980s have slowed global warming.
2. The Montreal Protocol's phase-out of CFCs contributed to this.
3. The study suggests that without this, temperatures would have risen faster.
4. The researchers also mention methane and CO2 growth slowing, though the reasons aren't fully understood.
5. They propose targeting other pollutants like black carbon and methane instead of just CO2 to combat climate change.

I should structure the summary to include these points concisely. Start with the study's findings, mention the Montreal Protocol's impact, the slower growth of other gases, and the alternative approach suggested by the researchers. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and to the point. Also, remember to include the key terms like Kyoto Protocol, Montreal Protocol, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and CO2. I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all essential aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers indicates that global warming has slowed due to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. This reduction is partly attributed to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that also trap heat more effectively than carbon dioxide. If emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures would have risen faster, reaching levels expected by 2100 by 2050. The study also notes slower growth in methane and CO2, though the reasons are unclear. The researchers suggest that increased plant and marine uptake of CO2 may contribute. They propose targeting other pollutants like black carbon, ozone, and methane, arguing that reducing methane by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to Kyoto Protocol CO2 cuts. This alternative approach could offer a politically feasible way to address climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
