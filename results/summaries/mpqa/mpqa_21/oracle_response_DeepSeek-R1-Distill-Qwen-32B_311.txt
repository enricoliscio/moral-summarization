Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. The article talks about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, partly due to the Montreal Protocol. It also mentions alternative strategies to combat climate change beyond Kyoto, focusing on other pollutants.

First, I'll identify the key points: the slowdown in emissions, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the focus on other pollutants like methane, and the researchers' suggestion to target these instead of just CO2.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words: implementation, agreed, phase, conducted, effort, adjusting, attacking. I should make sure these words are included naturally in the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the study's findings and the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Then, I'll note the researchers' effort and their suggestion to attack other pollutants. I'll also highlight the phase of reducing methane emissions and the impact it could have.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows well. I'll structure it to first present the main findings, then the implications, and finally the researchers' recommendations.

Let me draft it, making sure to include all the moral words and stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights a slowdown in the growth rate of greenhouse gases, partly due to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. These gases, though less prevalent, are potent heat-trappers. The researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato, conducted an analysis showing that if emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures would have risen much faster. They note that slower growth in methane and carbon dioxide is not fully understood but could be due to increased uptake by plants and marine organisms. Their work reflects an effort to explore alternative strategies to address climate change beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol, which focuses on carbon dioxide. By attacking other pollutants like methane, black carbon soot, and lower-atmosphere ozone, policymakers could make significant progress. For instance, reducing methane emissions by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to Kyoto's CO2 reduction goals. This study underscores the need to adjust global efforts to combat climate change through targeted actions against multiple pollutants. END OF SUMMARY.
