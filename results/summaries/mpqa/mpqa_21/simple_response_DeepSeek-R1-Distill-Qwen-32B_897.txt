Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, partly due to the Montreal Protocol. They mention that this has delayed the expected warming, which is a positive outcome.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspect. The original text talks about the effectiveness of international agreements like the Montreal Protocol and suggests alternative strategies to Kyoto, focusing on other pollutants. The moral framing here is about the success of international cooperation and the potential for more effective policies.

I should start by stating the main finding: emissions slowing and delayed warming. Then mention the Montreal Protocol's role. Next, explain the researchers' alternative approachâ€”targeting other pollutants. Finally, conclude with the moral implication that this shows the value of targeted policies over just CO2.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Also, avoid markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights that global greenhouse-gas emissions have slowed, delaying projected warming by several decades. This slowdown is partly attributed to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), also potent heat-trapping gases. The researchers suggest that if emissions had continued at 1980 levels, temperatures would have risen much faster. While the exact reasons for slower methane and CO2 growth remain unclear, increased plant and ocean absorption of CO2 may play a role. The study emphasizes that targeting pollutants like methane, black carbon, and lower-atmosphere ozone could achieve significant climate benefits without the political challenges of reducing CO2, which is central to the Kyoto Protocol. This approach offers a moral framing: international cooperation and targeted policies can effectively address climate change, even without fully implementing politically contentious agreements.
