SUMMARY: As countries prepare for battles over ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals a slowdown in the growth rate of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. This positive development is linked to the Montreal Protocol, which targeted ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat far more effectively than carbon dioxide, the main focus of the Kyoto Protocol. The NASA researchers behind the study attribute the slowdown to reduced methane emissions and increased CO2 uptake by plants and marine life. They argue that policymakers should also focus on curbing other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for instance, the climate impact would be comparable to the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This study underscores the significant headway that can be made by attacking these other pollutants, even as curbs on burning fossil fuels remain politically charged. The findings offer hope that the world is already on a path to a cooler future than once anticipated, with countries working together to adjust the globe's thermostat. END OF SUMMARY.
