SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has already taken a step towards a cooler future, thanks to the decline in greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's heat retention. This slowdown has delayed the anticipated climate warming by 50 years. The study's authors, Drs. Hansen and Sato, argue that policymakers can make significant progress by targeting other pollutants like methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, rather than solely focusing on carbon dioxide. They calculate that a 30% reduction in methane emissions would have a comparable effect on the climate as the CO2 cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This study offers a glimmer of hope, highlighting the importance of collective action in mitigating climate change.
