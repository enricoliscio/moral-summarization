SUMMARY: As countries prepare for battles over ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, researchers report that the world is already on a path to a cooler future. They link the declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the 1980s to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases. The researchers calculate that the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures currently anticipated for 2100 if emissions had continued to increase at the peak rate reached in 1980. They argue that policymakers can make significant progress by focusing on other pollutants like black carbon soot and methane, calculating that reducing methane emissions by 30 percent would have effects comparable to those envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. The study suggests that the slowdown in emissions growth is due to the Montreal Protocol and other factors that need further study. END OF SUMMARY.
