SUMMARY: As the world prepares for discussions on the Kyoto Protocol, a NASA study reveals a slowing of greenhouse gas emissions since the 1980s, thanks to the Montreal Protocol's phase-out of ozone-depleting gases. The climate in 2050 will be cooler than expected, with temperatures similar to those anticipated in 2100 when CO2 levels double. The NASA researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato, attribute the slowdown to reduced methane and carbon dioxide growth rates and the Montreal Protocol's success in curbing chlorofluorocarbons. They advocate for a broader approach beyond CO2 reduction, targeting pollutants like methane, black carbon soot, and ozone. Their research highlights a 30% cut in methane emissions as a significant step, with outcomes comparable to the Kyoto Protocol's initial goals. This study underscores the potential for meaningful climate action by addressing a wider range of greenhouse gases and pollutants. END OF SUMMARY.
