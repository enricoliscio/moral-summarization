SUMMARY: As the world prepares for the Kyoto Protocol, a study finds that declining greenhouse gas emissions have already slowed the rate at which the atmosphere traps heat. The Montreal Protocol, which targeted ozone-depleting gases, has played a role in this positive development. The NASA researchers behind the study suggest that the slowdown may also be due to increased carbon dioxide uptake by plants and marine life. They argue that significant progress can be made in adjusting the globe's thermostat by targeting pollutants like methane and black carbon soot, rather than solely focusing on CO2 emissions. Their work offers a promising path forward in the fight against climate change, suggesting that we may have already averted the worst-case scenarios of future warming. END OF SUMMARY.
