SUMMARY: As the world prepares for the challenges of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a NASA study reveals a silver lining: declining greenhouse gas emissions since the 1980s have slowed the atmosphere's heat retention. This positive development is attributed to the Montreal Protocol, which targeted ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. The researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato of NASA's Goddard Institute, suggest that the slowdown is also due to the unexplained decline in methane and carbon dioxide growth. They advocate for a broader approach to climate change mitigation, targeting pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which can have a significant impact on the climate without solely focusing on CO2 reductions. Their work underscores the importance of global efforts like the Montreal Protocol and encourages exploration of alternative paths to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
