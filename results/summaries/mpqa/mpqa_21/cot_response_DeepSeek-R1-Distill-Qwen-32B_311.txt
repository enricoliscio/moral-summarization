Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a specific news article and outlined two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral terms.

I need to start by understanding the article. It's about a study showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed due to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting substances. This has had a positive impact on slowing climate change. The researchers suggest that focusing on other pollutants besides CO2 could be effective.

Now, for the first step, I have to identify all single words that are morally framed. I should go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "battle," "phase out," "erode," "protective," "curbing," "booming," "headway," "curbs," "reducing," "comparable," "visioned," and "commitment." These words imply actions that are either positive or negative in a moral sense.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should include these moral terms. I have to make sure it's concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main finding: the slowdown in greenhouse gases due to the Montreal Protocol. Then mention the researchers' suggestion about other pollutants and their impact. I'll conclude by highlighting the implications for policymakers and the positive outcome of the Montreal Protocol.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too technical. Also, preserving the moral framing is crucial, so I'll use the identified words appropriately in the summary.

Let me put it all together. Start with the study's finding, mention the Montreal Protocol's role, discuss the alternative pollutants, their effects, and the potential for policymakers. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

**STEP 1:**  
* Battle  
* Phase out  
* Erode  
* Protective  
* Curbing  
* Booming  
* Headway  
* Curbs  
* Reducing  
* Comparable  
* Visioned  
* Commitment  

**SUMMARY:**  
A recent study by NASA researchers highlights how declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the Earth's warming, partly due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. These gases, which trap heat more effectively than carbon dioxide, were curbed, delaying potential temperature increases. The slowdown also reflects reduced methane and carbon dioxide growth, though the reasons remain unclear. The researchers argue that policymakers could make significant headway by targeting other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, suggesting that reducing methane emissions by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to the Kyoto Protocol's CO2 cuts. This study underscores the importance of addressing multiple pollutants to combat climate change, offering a hopeful vision of progress beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
