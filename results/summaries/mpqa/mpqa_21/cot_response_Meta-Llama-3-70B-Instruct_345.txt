SUMMARY:
A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has taken a step towards a cooler future, thanks to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The protocol's phase-out of ozone-depleting gases, which also trap heat, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. This slowdown is a significant step forward, as it would have taken until 2100 to reach the temperatures expected by 2050 if the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had continued. The study's authors, Drs. Hansen and Sato, argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. They calculate that reducing methane emissions by 30 percent would have a comparable effect on the climate to the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach is a more responsible way to adjust the globe's thermostat, rather than relying solely on curbing CO2 emissions, which is a politically charged issue. END OF SUMMARY.
