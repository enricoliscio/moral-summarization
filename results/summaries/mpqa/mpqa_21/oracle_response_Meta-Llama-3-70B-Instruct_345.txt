SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers James Hansen and Makiko Sato suggests that the world has already taken a significant step towards a cooler future. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions. This effort has led to a decline in emissions since the late 1980s, resulting in a slower rate of global warming. The researchers conducted the study to explore alternative paths to adjusting the globe's thermostat, beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol. They argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone. For example, reducing methane emissions by 30% would have a comparable effect on climate as the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. The study's findings offer a promising approach to mitigating climate change.
