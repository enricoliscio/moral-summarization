SUMMARY: As countries prepare for the moral battle of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals a glimmer of hope in the fight against global warming. The research suggests that the world is already on a path towards a cooler future, with declining greenhouse gas emissions since the 1980s slowing the atmosphere's heat retention. The Montreal Protocol, targeting ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, is credited for this positive shift. The study highlights the potential of focusing on other pollutants, such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, to make a significant and comparable impact on climate change. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for instance, the climate benefits could match those envisioned under the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. This path offers an alternative to the politically charged effort of curbing CO2 emissions, which targets the fuel sources of booming economies. The study, conducted by NASA researchers, underscores the importance of exploring diverse approaches to adjusting the globe's thermostat and provides valuable insights into the complex challenge of battling climate change.
