SUMMARY:
A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world is already on a path to a cooler future, thanks to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The protocol's phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, which erode the ozone layer and trap heat, has slowed the growth rate of greenhouse gases. If the rate of increase had been maintained, the climate would have reached temperatures by 2050 that are currently anticipated for 2100. The researchers, Drs. Hansen and Sato, argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach is a more responsible way to curb global warming, as it doesn't rely solely on curbing CO2 emissions, which would require significant curbs on burning coal, oil, and natural gas - the fuels of booming economies.
