SUMMARY: As nations prepare for discussions on ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals that the world has already taken steps to mitigate climate change. The research, conducted by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, suggests that declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. This positive development is attributed partly to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, and to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide. The study, led by James Hansen and Makiko Sato, explores paths to adjusting the global thermostat beyond the Kyoto Protocol's focus on carbon dioxide. They argue that significant progress can be made by attacking other pollutants, such as methane and black carbon soot. Their efforts highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to mitigating climate change and provide valuable insights for policymakers.
