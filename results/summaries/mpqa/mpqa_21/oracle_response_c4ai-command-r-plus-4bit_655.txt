SUMMARY: As the world gears up for discussions on ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a study by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies reveals a silver lining: the world is already on a path to a cooler future than expected. The research attributes this to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s, linked to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases. This slowdown is also due to the mysterious slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide. The study, conducted by James Hansen and Makiko Sato, explores paths to adjusting the globe's thermostat beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol, which focuses solely on carbon dioxide. Hansen and Sato argue that policymakers can make significant strides by attacking other pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. Their effort highlights the potential for comparable climate effects by reducing methane emissions by 30 percent. The study appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in December 2001.
