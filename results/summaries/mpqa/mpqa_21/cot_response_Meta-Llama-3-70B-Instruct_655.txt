SUMMARY:
A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has taken a step in the right direction towards a cooler future. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which aimed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions. This slowdown has had a significant impact, and if the rate of increase had continued at its peak, the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures not anticipated until 2100. The researchers argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone, rather than solely focusing on carbon dioxide. By reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This study offers a more optimistic outlook on the future, suggesting that responsible actions can lead to a cooler climate. END OF SUMMARY.
