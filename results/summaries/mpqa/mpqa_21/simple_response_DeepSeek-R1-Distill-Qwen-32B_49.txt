Alright, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed since the late 80s. This is partly due to the Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. The slowdown might also be from methane and CO2 growth slowing, though the reasons aren't clear yet. The researchers suggest that besides CO2, targeting other pollutants like black carbon and methane could be effective, maybe even more so than just focusing on CO2 as Kyoto does.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The study shows that international agreements like Montreal can have positive impacts, which is a good moral point about cooperation. Also, the suggestion to target other pollutants besides CO2 could be seen as a more feasible approach, especially for developing economies that rely on fossil fuels. This provides a moral argument for looking beyond CO2 for solutions.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these key points: the slowdown in emissions, the role of the Montreal Protocol, the possible reasons for methane and CO2 trends, and the alternative pollutants approach. I'll structure it to first state the slowdown, then the causes, and end with the alternative solutions proposed.

Let me check if I'm preserving the author's moral framing. The original article emphasizes the success of international agreements and suggests more effective, less economically damaging alternatives. I need to convey that policymakers should consider these alternatives, highlighting the moral responsibility to find practical solutions that don't hinder economic growth too much.

I think I've got the main points. Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the key finding, mention the Montreal Protocol's role, the uncertainties about methane and CO2, and then the alternative pollutants approach with the example of methane reduction. Finally, I'll note the implications for policymakers and the potential benefits of this approach.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights a slowdown in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s, partly due to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These gases also trap heat thousands of times more effectively than carbon dioxide. If emissions had continued at the 1980 peak rate, global temperatures would have reached higher levels by 2050 than currently anticipated. The study suggests that slower growth in methane and CO2 concentrations may also contribute to this trend, though the reasons are not fully understood. The researchers argue that policymakers should consider targeting other pollutants, such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, as a more effective and less economically disruptive approach to combating climate change compared to the Kyoto Protocol's focus on CO2. For instance, reducing methane emissions by 30% could have a climate impact comparable to Kyoto's CO2 reduction goals. The findings emphasize the potential for alternative strategies to address global warming while acknowledging the complexities of reducing CO2 emissions tied to fossil fuel use. END OF SUMMARY.
