SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has taken a significant step towards a cooler future. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which aimed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, has led to a decline in greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. This effort has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat, buying us time to address climate change. The researchers, Drs. Hansen and Sato, conducted the study to explore alternative paths to adjusting the globe's thermostat, beyond the politically charged Kyoto Protocol. They argue that policymakers can make significant headway by attacking other pollutants such as methane, black carbon soot, and ozone. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. The study's findings offer a glimmer of hope, demonstrating that collective effort and agreement can lead to positive change.
