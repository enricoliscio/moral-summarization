SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has already taken steps towards a cooler future due to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The study links this slowdown to the implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases that also trap heat. If emissions had continued to rise at their peak rate, the climate would have reached temperatures by 2050 that are currently not anticipated until 2100. The researchers also found that the growth rate of methane and carbon dioxide has slowed, possibly due to increased CO2 uptake by plants and marine organisms. The study's authors argue that policymakers can make significant progress by targeting other pollutants such as black carbon, ozone, and methane, which could have a comparable impact on the climate as cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol.
