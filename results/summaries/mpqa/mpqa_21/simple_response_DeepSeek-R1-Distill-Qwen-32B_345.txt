Alright, so the user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert. Hmm, okay, first I need to understand the article's content and the underlying moral message.

The article talks about a study by NASA researchers showing that greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, partly due to the Montreal Protocol. It highlights that this has delayed the expected temperature rise. The moral angle here seems to be about the effectiveness of international agreements and the importance of addressing other pollutants besides CO2.

I should make sure the summary captures that the Montreal Protocol, which aimed to protect the ozone layer, also had a positive unintended effect on climate change. This shows that international cooperation can work. Also, the researchers suggest targeting other pollutants like methane and black carbon, which could be a more feasible approach for countries, especially those with growing economies that rely on fossil fuels.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me structure it to first mention the study, then the impact of the Montreal Protocol, the potential for targeting other pollutants, and the moral implication of effective international action. I'll avoid technical jargon to keep it clear and focused on the moral framing.

SUMMARY: A recent study by NASA researchers highlights a slowdown in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, partly due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These CFCs also trap heat thousands of times more effectively than carbon dioxide. The study suggests that if emissions had continued at their 1980 peak, global temperatures would have risen much faster, with 2050 temperatures matching those expected in 2100. The slowdown is also linked to reduced methane and CO2 growth, though the exact reasons are unclear. The researchers argue that policymakers should focus on reducing other pollutants, such as methane and black carbon soot, which could yield significant climate benefits without the political challenges of curbing CO2, the main target of the Kyoto Protocol. This approach could help countries balance economic growth with climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
