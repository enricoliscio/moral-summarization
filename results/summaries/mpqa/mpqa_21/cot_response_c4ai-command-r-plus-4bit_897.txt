SUMMARY: As countries prepare for the moral battle of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals a promising path to a cooler future. The research suggests that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the 1980s have mitigated the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. The Montreal Protocol, implemented in 1987, is held responsible for this positive development, as countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, which are also potent heat-trapping agents. The slowdown in methane and carbon dioxide growth rates is also contributing to this trend, although the reasons are not yet fully understood. The NASA researchers, Hansen and Sato, advocate for significant headway by attacking other pollutants like methane, black carbon soot, and ozone. They argue that reducing methane emissions by 30 percent could have a comparable effect on the climate as the envisioned cuts in CO2 under the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. This study offers a moral glimpse into a future with a more stable climate, anticipating temperatures not expected until 2100 when CO2 concentrations double.
