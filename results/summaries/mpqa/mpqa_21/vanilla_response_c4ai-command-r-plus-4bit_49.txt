SUMMARY: A study by researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) suggests that the world has already begun to slow the rate at which the atmosphere retains heat, potentially staving off more extreme temperature increases in the future. The researchers attribute this positive development to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which targeted gases that deplete the ozone layer and also trap heat in the atmosphere. They also note that the slowdown could be due to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, the reasons for which are not yet fully understood.

Drs. Hansen and Sato, the researchers behind the study, argue that policymakers should focus on reducing other pollutants beyond carbon dioxide, such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane. They believe that significant progress can be made by targeting these other greenhouse gases, which have a comparable impact on the climate as carbon dioxide reductions envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. Their work highlights the importance of exploring alternative paths to mitigating climate change, beyond the politically sensitive issue of curbing fossil fuel use. END OF SUMMARY.
