SUMMARY:

A recent study by NASA researchers suggests that the world has taken a step towards a cooler future due to declining greenhouse gas emissions since the late 1980s. The implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which phased out ozone-depleting gases, has slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had continued at its peak, the climate would have reached temperatures by 2050 that are currently anticipated for 2100. The study highlights the importance of addressing pollutants like black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, which can have a significant impact on the climate. By reducing methane emissions by 30%, for example, the effect on the climate would be comparable to the cuts in CO2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol. This approach offers a morally responsible alternative to the politically charged Kyoto Protocol, which focuses on curbing CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels.
