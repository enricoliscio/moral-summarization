SUMMARY: As nations prepare for discussions on ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a study reveals that global actions have already contributed to a cooler future. The research, conducted by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, suggests that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the 1980s have slowed the atmosphere's heat retention rate. This positive development is linked to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agreed to phase out ozone-depleting gases, which also have a significant heat-trapping effect. The study's authors, James Hansen and Makiko Sato, argue that policymakers should focus on adjusting the globe's thermostat by attacking other pollutants, such as methane and black carbon soot. They believe that significant progress can be made by targeting these alternative greenhouse gases rather than solely focusing on carbon dioxide curbs, which carry political and economic implications. The duo's efforts highlight the importance of exploring alternative paths to combat climate change and provide valuable insights into the complex world of climate policy. END OF SUMMARY.
