SUMMARY: As the world gears up for discussions on the Kyoto Protocol, a NASA study reveals a slowing in the growth rate of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability due to declining greenhouse gas emissions. This positive development is attributed to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and the phasing out of ozone-depleting gases. The researchers, James Hansen and Makiko Sato of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, argue that adjusting the globe's thermostat can be achieved through attacking other pollutants like methane and black carbon soot. Their effort highlights a significant contribution to slowing climate change without curbing the burning of fossil fuels. The study suggests that a 30% reduction in methane emissions can have a comparable effect to the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. The work underscores the importance of international agreements and the potential for progress through alternative paths. END OF SUMMARY.
