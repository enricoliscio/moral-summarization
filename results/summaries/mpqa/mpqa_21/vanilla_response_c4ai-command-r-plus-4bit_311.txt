SUMMARY: A study by researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) suggests that the world has already taken steps to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers found that declining emissions since the late 1980s, partly due to the Montreal Protocol, have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's heat-retaining ability. They also noted unexplained slower growth rates of methane and carbon dioxide. The study proposes that significant progress can be made in adjusting the globe's thermostat by targeting pollutants such as black carbon soot, ozone, and methane, in addition to focusing on carbon dioxide reductions as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol. According to the researchers, reducing methane emissions by 30 percent would have a comparable effect on climate as the cuts in CO2 envisioned by Kyoto during its first commitment period. The work highlights potential alternatives to the politically challenging task of curbing the use of fossil fuels, which power booming economies worldwide.
