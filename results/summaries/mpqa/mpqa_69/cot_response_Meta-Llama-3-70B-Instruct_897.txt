SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, condemning the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the plan gathered, carrying banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." They handed a letter to President Bush, expressing their dismay and regret over his new climate change plan, which they believe would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels. The NGOs demanded that Bush reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, calling it the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. END OF SUMMARY.
