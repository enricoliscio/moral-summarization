Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They're protesting near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush arrives. There are about 50 people from various NGOs, both Japanese and U.S., opposing the U.S. alternative. They're carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush." 

They handed a letter to Bush, criticizing his new climate plan as inadequate because it allows greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They argue that this plan isn't an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol and demand Bush to reconsider and rejoin the protocol. 

The NGOs also mention that Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush will discuss climate measures. Additionally, Peace Boat sent a letter asking the U.S. to help developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair support, and they're critical of Bush's terrorism policies, like air raids and nuclear tests.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The protesters are morally opposed to the U.S. stance, calling it irresponsible and harmful. They emphasize the importance of the Kyoto Protocol as the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They're also concerned about U.S. actions beyond climate, like in the war on terrorism.

I should structure the summary to highlight the protest, the criticism of the U.S. plan, the moral stance on climate change, and the broader issues like terrorism and military presence. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral elements are clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral arguments presented by the protesters. I'll start with the protest details, then move to the letter's contents, the NGOs' demands, and the additional issues raised in the letters. Finally, I'll note that the protest reflects a moral stance on climate and U.S. policies.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing its inadequacy in curbing global warming. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol. They handed a letter to President Bush, criticizing his new climate plan for allowing a 30% increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. The NGOs urged Bush to reconsider his policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest coincided with heightened security for Bush's visit, as Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush were set to discuss climate measures. Additionally, NGOs called for U.S. leadership in aiding developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair support, while criticizing Bush's policies on terrorism, including air raids and nuclear tests. The protest highlighted the moral imperative to address climate change and U.S. global responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
