SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a moral protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his position on curbing global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing their dismay at the U.S.'s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the new plan unveiled by Bush, which allows for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The protesters called on Bush to reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, stating that it is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They also urged Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm on the protocol and ratify it after the Diet's approval during the current session. The demonstration took place amid heightened security around the embassy during Bush's visit. The protesters demanded moral responsibility from the U.S., calling on the country to lead in helping developing nations through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, as well as to cease nuclear experiments and reduce its military presence in Japan. The protesters also referenced the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, urging the U.S. not to push other governments to cooperate in its "war against terrorism."
END OF SUMMARY.
