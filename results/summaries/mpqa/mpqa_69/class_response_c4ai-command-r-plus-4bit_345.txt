SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, protesting near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact gathered, carrying banners that urged ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters stood against Bush's new plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, allowing U.S. emissions to increase compared to 1990 levels. In a letter addressed to Bush, the NGOs demanded that he reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The groups also called on the U.S. to help developing countries through peaceful dialogue and economic support, and to cease nuclear experiments and military actions, including air raids on Afghanistan. The protest took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Meanwhile, Japanese and U.S. officials have stated that measures to tackle global warming will be a key discussion point when Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush meet. The groups urged Koizumi to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and informed him of Japan's plan to ratify the protocol soon.
