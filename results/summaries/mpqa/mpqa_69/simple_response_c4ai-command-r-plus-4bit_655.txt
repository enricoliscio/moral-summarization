SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. non-governmental organizations gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to express their disapproval of the U.S. stance on the issue. The protesters carried banners urging Japan to stand firm on the Kyoto Protocol and calling for the U.S. to reconsider its position. In a letter addressed to Bush, the NGOs stated that his new plan, which proposes voluntary limits on emissions, is inadequate and would allow U.S. emissions to increase significantly compared to the 1990 level. They demanded that the U.S. rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only existing framework to address climate change effectively. The protest took place ahead of Bush's visit to Japan, where the issue of global warming is expected to be discussed with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The demonstrators also called on the U.S. to take a more peaceful and supportive approach in international relations, including stopping air raids on Afghanistan and reducing its military presence in Japan. These actions demonstrate a moral stance for environmental protection and global cooperation, prioritizing the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants over economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
