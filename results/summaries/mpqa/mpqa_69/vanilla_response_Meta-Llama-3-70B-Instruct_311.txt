SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the US Embassy in Tokyo. About 50 members of Japanese and US NGOs opposed to the US plan gathered to express their disapproval. They carried banners and handed a letter to a guard at the embassy, addressed to President George W. Bush, urging him to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The NGOs criticized the US plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, saying it would allow emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. Other NGOs also sent separate letters to Koizumi and Bush, calling on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries and to stop air raids on Afghanistan, among other requests.
