SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday, expressing their disapproval of the United States' alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at curbing global warming. The protesters, representing various Japanese and U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), took a stand against the U.S. decision to reject the protocol and instead propose voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. In a letter addressed to President George W. Bush, the protesters demanded that he reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, stating that it is the only existing framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They also urged the U.S. to ratify the protocol and take on a more positive role in tackling global warming. The demonstration occurred ahead of President Bush's visit to Japan, where he is expected to discuss global warming measures with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The protesters called on the Japanese government to stick to its plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to encourage the U.S. to do the same. Other NGOs, such as Peace Boat, also voiced their concerns, asking the U.S. to show leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, as well as requesting an end to air raids on Afghanistan and a reduction in U.S. military bases in Japan. The protesters believe that the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol is unacceptable and would allow for a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1990 level.
END OF SUMMARY.
