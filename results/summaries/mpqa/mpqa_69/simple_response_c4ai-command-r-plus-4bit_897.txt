SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a moral protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his stance on climate change. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing their dismay at the voluntary approach to greenhouse gas emissions proposed by Bush. They argued that the plan would allow U.S. emissions to increase significantly compared to the 1990 level, endangering the planet. The protesters demanded that Bush reconsider his climate policy, re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, and prioritize the prevention of dangerous climate change. The NGOs also called on Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm on the Kyoto Protocol and ratify it during the current Diet session. Peace Boat, another participating NGO, urged the U.S. to take a leadership role in helping developing countries through peaceful means and to refrain from pushing other governments to cooperate in its "war on terrorism." The protest reflected a strong moral stance against the potential consequences of unchecked global warming and a belief in the responsibility of world leaders to protect the environment.
