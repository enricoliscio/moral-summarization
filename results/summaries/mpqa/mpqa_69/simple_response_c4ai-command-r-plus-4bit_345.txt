SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a moral protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling on President George W. Bush to reconsider his position on curbing global warming. The protest, held near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, highlighted the moral dilemma between economic growth and the responsibility to tackle climate change. The demonstrators argued that the U.S. plan, which allows for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, is unacceptable and insufficient to address the scale of the climate crisis. They demanded that the U.S. reconsider its climate policy, re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The protest occurred ahead of Bush's visit to Japan, where climate change was expected to be a key discussion point between the U.S. and Japanese leaders. The demonstrators also called on Japan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and urged the U.S. to take a more peaceful and supportive approach in its international relations, especially regarding the "war on terrorism" and its impact on developing countries. The protest reflected a strong ethical stance on environmental protection and global cooperation, challenging the U.S.'s economic-centric approach to climate policy. END OF SUMMARY.
