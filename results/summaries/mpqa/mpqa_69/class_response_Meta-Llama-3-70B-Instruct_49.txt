SUMMARY:

Environmental groups staged a demonstration against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters, carrying banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol," stood firm in their opposition to the U.S. plan, which they believe would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. The NGOs handed a letter to the embassy, expressing their dismay at the new plan and demanding that Bush take a stand against climate change by preventing dangerous climate change through the Kyoto Protocol. Meanwhile, other groups called on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to stop pushing other governments to cooperate in its "war against terrorism." The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be a main issue.
