SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling it unacceptable and urging President Bush to reconsider and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protest, which included around 50 members from Japanese and US NGOs, took place near the US Embassy in Tokyo ahead of Bush's arrival. The groups argued that the US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, would allow emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010. They emphasized that the Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest also included calls for Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi to urge Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and for the US to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support.
