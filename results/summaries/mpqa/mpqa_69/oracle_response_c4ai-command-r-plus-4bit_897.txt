SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to curb global warming. The protest took place near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President Bush's visit to Japan. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs expressed their strong disapproval of the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact. They carried banners calling for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and urging Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm against Bush's plan. In a letter handed to the embassy, the NGOs expressed dismay at Bush's new climate change plan, which allows for increased greenhouse gas emissions. They demanded that Bush reconsider his plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The NGOs also called on Bush to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to stop air raids on Afghanistan. They urged an end to nuclear experiments and a reduction of U.S. military bases in Japan. The protest took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Environmental issues are expected to be a key topic of discussion between Prime Minister Koizumi and President Bush during their meeting in Tokyo.
