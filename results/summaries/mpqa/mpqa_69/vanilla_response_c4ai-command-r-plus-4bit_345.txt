SUMMARY: Ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to Japan, around 50 members of Japanese and U.S. environmental NGOs protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at curbing global warming. The protesters expressed their dismay at the U.S.'s decision to reject the protocol and instead propose a plan with voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions. They demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing that it is the only existing framework to address climate change effectively. The protest occurred amidst tightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Representatives of the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing their concerns about the U.S. plan, which they believe will lead to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. They urged Bush to reconsider and take a more responsible approach to tackling climate change. One of the protesters, Masaaki Nakajima of Friends of the Earth Japan, stated that they cannot accept the U.S. alternative. The article also mentions that measures to address global warming will be a key topic of discussion during President Bush's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
