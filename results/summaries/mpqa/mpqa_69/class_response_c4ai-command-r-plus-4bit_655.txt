SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, protesting near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact gathered, carrying banners that urged ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters stood against Bush's plan, unveiled on Thursday, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies. This plan allows for increased emissions compared to the 1990 level, and the protesters demanded that Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The demonstration took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Representatives of the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing dismay at Bush's climate change plan and calling for immediate action. They also urged Prime Minister Koizumi to encourage Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the protocol. Another letter from Peace Boat called on the U.S. to take a leading role in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair support, while also requesting an end to air raids on Afghanistan and a reduction in U.S. military bases in Japan. The protesters pushed back against the sacrifice of economic growth for climate change prevention. END OF SUMMARY.
