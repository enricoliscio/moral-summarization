SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups in Japan protested the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to Tokyo. About 50 members from various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy, carrying banners urging Japan to stick to the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters argued that Bush's new plan, which calls for voluntary limits on emissions, would allow U.S. emissions to increase significantly compared to the 1990 level. They handed a letter to the embassy, demanding that Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The demonstration took place amid tightened security for the president's visit, and the issue of global warming is expected to be a key topic of discussion between Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Peace Boat, one of the participating NGOs, also called on the U.S. to take a leadership role in helping developing countries and to stop air raids on Afghanistan, among other requests. The protest highlights the ongoing tensions between environmental advocates and the U.S. administration over the best approach to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
