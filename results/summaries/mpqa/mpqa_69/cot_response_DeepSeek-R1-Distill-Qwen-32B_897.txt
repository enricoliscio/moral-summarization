Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're opposing Bush's plan, which they see as insufficient. 

Now, for the first part, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "protest," "opposed," "cannot accept," "regrettable," "dismayed," "international outcry," "sacrificing," "cannot be an 'alternative,'" "reconsider," "only existing," "fair economic support," "push," "cooperate," "war against terrorism," "stop," "cease," "reduce." These words seem to carry moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating the protest against the U.S. alternative, mention the groups involved, their opposition, and the moral stance they're taking. I'll include the letter they handed over, their disappointment with Bush's plan, and their demand for reconsideration. Also, I should mention the broader issues they're addressing, like the environment and other concerns such as terrorism and military presence.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to first describe the protest, then the specifics of their objections, and finally the additional issues they're raising. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

**SUMMARY:**

Environmental groups staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, expressing moral opposition to President Bush's climate plan. Protesters, including NGOs like Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners demanding the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and urged Prime Minister Koizumi to oppose Bush's plan. They handed a letter to the embassy, criticizing Bush's proposal as insufficient and morally flawed, allowing a 30% increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The groups demanded Bush reconsider his policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing its importance as the only international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Additionally, they urged the U.S. to provide fair economic support to developing countries and cease actions like air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear tests. The protest highlighted broader moral concerns, including opposition to the "war against terrorism" and reducing U.S. military bases in Japan. END OF SUMMARY.
