SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan and the US staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "regrettable" and "unacceptable". The protest, held near the US Embassy in Tokyo, demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The groups argued that the US plan, which relies on voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, would allow emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They emphasized that the Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest also called on the Japanese government to urge the US to return to the Kyoto Protocol and to prioritize peaceful dialogue and fair economic support over military cooperation. The moral framing of the protest is clear: the US is taking a negative and irresponsible stance on climate change, and it is the duty of governments to prioritize the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants over economic growth.
