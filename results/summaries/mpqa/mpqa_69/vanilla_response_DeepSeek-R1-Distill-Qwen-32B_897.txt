Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. So, environmentalist groups are protesting near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They're upset because Bush's plan doesn't have mandatory targets, just voluntary limits based on economic growth. The Kyoto Protocol was rejected by Bush earlier, which caused a lot of international criticism. The protesters handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing their dismay and asking Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. They also mentioned that Bush's plan would allow U.S. emissions to increase by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels. The NGOs involved include Friends of the Earth Japan, Kiko Network, and Peace Boat. They also sent messages to Prime Minister Koizumi, urging him to push Bush to rejoin Kyoto and to ratify it themselves. Additionally, they addressed other issues like the war on terrorism and U.S. military presence. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, focusing on the protest, the groups involved, their demands, and the context of Bush's visit. I should make sure to include key points like the voluntary vs. mandatory targets, the increase in emissions, and the main诉求 to Bush and Koizumi. Also, note that the protest happened before Bush's arrival and that security was heightened. I need to structure this clearly, starting with the protest, then the groups, their message, and the implications. Keep it factual and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against President George W. Bush's alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They criticized Bush's plan, which replaces mandatory emission targets with voluntary limits tied to economic growth, arguing it would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels. Protesters handed a letter to the embassy, urging Bush to reconsider his climate policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. They also urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to push Bush to return to the protocol and ratify it in Japan. The protest coincided with heightened security for Bush's visit, with climate policy expected to be a key topic in his meeting with Koizumi. END OF SUMMARY.
