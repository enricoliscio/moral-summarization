SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling for President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters, comprising 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs, gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, carrying banners that read "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." They handed a letter to the embassy, expressing dismay over Bush's new plan, which allows for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions instead of mandatory reduction targets. The NGOs argued that this plan would increase emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010, and urged Bush to take leadership in preventing dangerous climate change. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. The NGOs also called on the U.S. to stop air raids on Afghanistan and reduce military bases in Japan, among other requests.
