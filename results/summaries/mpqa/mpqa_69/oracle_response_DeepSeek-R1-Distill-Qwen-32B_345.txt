Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used, like "curbing," "taken," "stand," etc. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They were against Bush's plan, which they see as not effective. They carried banners and handed letters to the embassy. The NGOs were dismayed by the U.S. plan, which allows increased emissions. They demanded Bush reconsider and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. Also, they addressed other issues like terrorism and military actions. I need to include these points concisely, using the morally charged words. Let me structure the summary to include the protest, the NGOs' concerns, the U.S. plan's flaws, and their demands. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and use the specified words where possible.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, which they view as inadequate in curbing global warming. About 50 members from Japanese and U.S. NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, opposed the U.S. plan, calling it regrettable and urging the U.S. to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Protesters carried banners and handed letters to the embassy, expressing their dismay over the plan, which they claim would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% by 2010. They demanded President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing it as the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The NGOs also criticized the U.S. for not taking leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support. The protest coincided with heightened security ahead of Bush's visit, as global warming measures were set to be discussed between Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush. The NGOs urged Koizumi to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and highlighted concerns over U.S. military actions and terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
