SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups in Japan and the US staged a demonstration near the US Embassy in Tokyo, protesting the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. They carried banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol", urging the US to take a positive stand against climate change. The protesters handed a letter to the embassy, expressing their dismay at the US's new climate change plan, which they believe would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, other NGOs called on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to stop pushing other governments to cooperate in its "war against terrorism".
