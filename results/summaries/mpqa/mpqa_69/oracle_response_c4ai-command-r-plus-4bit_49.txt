SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to curb global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to express their opposition to the U.S. stance on the protocol. The protesters carried banners demanding that the Kyoto Protocol be ratified and that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stick to the agreement. In a letter to Bush, the NGOs expressed dismay at his new climate change plan, which allows for increased greenhouse gas emissions compared to the protocol's mandatory reduction targets. They demanded that Bush reconsider his plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol to prevent dangerous climate change. Measures to tackle global warming are expected to be a key topic of discussion between Koizumi and Bush during the president's visit to Japan. Meanwhile, another NGO, Peace Boat, called on the U.S. to show leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to cease air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear experiments, among other requests. The protest took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit.
