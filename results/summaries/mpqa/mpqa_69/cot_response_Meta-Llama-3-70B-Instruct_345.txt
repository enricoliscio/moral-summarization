SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, calling it a "regrettable" and "negative" stand. The protesters, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, opposed the voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, saying it would allow the current emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels. They were "terribly dismayed" by the new plan and demanded that President Bush "reconsider" his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The groups emphasized that the Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent "dangerous" climate change. Meanwhile, they also urged Prime Minister Koizumi to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify it. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. END OF SUMMARY.
