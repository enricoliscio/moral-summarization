SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups in Japan protested the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered to express their opposition to the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact. They carried banners calling for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and urging Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm against Bush's alternative plan. The protesters handed a letter to the embassy, criticizing Bush's new climate change plan as inadequate and demanding an immediate reconsideration of his climate policy. The letter also emphasized the importance of the Kyoto Protocol as the only existing framework to address climate change effectively. The demonstration took place amid heightened security for Bush's visit, and the protesters emphasized the need for global cooperation in tackling climate change. The NGOs urged Bush to reevaluate his position and prioritize sustainable economic growth over voluntary emissions reductions. They also called on the U.S. to provide peaceful dialogue and fair economic support to developing countries, reduce military bases in Japan, and cease nuclear experiments, among other requests.
