SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a *protest* against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to curb global warming, near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Protesters expressed their *regrettable* disagreement with President George W. Bush's decision to reject the protocol, stating that voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies are insufficient and would sacrifice economic growth. In a letter to Bush, the groups *demanded* a reconsideration of his climate policy plan and a return to the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing the *dangerous* consequences of increased emissions. The letter also highlighted the moral responsibility of the United States to help developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support. Additionally, the groups urged an end to air raids on Afghanistan, a *cease* to nuclear experiments, and a *reduction* in U.S. military bases in Japan. The *protest* took place ahead of Bush's visit to Tokyo, where he will discuss global warming measures with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
