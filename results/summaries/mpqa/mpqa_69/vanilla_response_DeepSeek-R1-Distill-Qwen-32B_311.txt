Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush arrived. About 50 people from NGOs like Friends of the Earth Japan were there. They were holding banners supporting the Kyoto Protocol and urging Prime Minister Koizumi to oppose Bush's plan. They handed a letter to the embassy guard, criticizing Bush's new climate plan, which relies on voluntary limits instead of mandatory targets. They argued this would increase U.S. emissions by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels. They demanded Bush reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol.

Additionally, other groups like Kiko Network and Peace Boat sent messages to Koizumi and Bush. They wanted Bush to help developing countries through dialogue and support, and they also addressed issues like the war on terrorism and military bases.

The main issues for discussion between Koizumi and Bush include global warming measures. The summary should capture the protest, the NGOs' criticism of the U.S. plan, their demands, and the broader context of the meetings.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include key points: the protest, the NGOs involved, their main arguments against the U.S. plan, the letter's content, and the related discussions between the leaders. Also, mention the additional requests from other groups briefly.

Let me structure it: start with the protest details, then the NGOs' criticism and demands, followed by the broader context of the meetings and additional requests. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including NGOs from Japan and the U.S., protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol ahead of President George W. Bush's arrival. About 50 protesters carried banners supporting the Kyoto Protocol and urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to oppose Bush's plan. They handed a letter to the embassy, criticizing Bush's new climate change plan, which replaces mandatory emissions targets with voluntary limits tied to economic growth. The NGOs argued this would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels and demanded Bush reconsider his policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. Other groups, like Kiko Network and Peace Boat, sent messages to Koizumi and Bush, urging the U.S. to help developing countries through dialogue and fair support, and to address issues like terrorism and military presence. Measures to tackle global warming were set to be discussed between Koizumi and Bush during their meeting. END OF SUMMARY.
