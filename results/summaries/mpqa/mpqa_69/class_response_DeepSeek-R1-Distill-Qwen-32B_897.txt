Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible: stand, carried, demonstration, prevent, helping, support, attacks, push.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before Bush's arrival. They were opposing the U.S. stance, which they saw as negative. The protesters carried banners and handed a letter to the embassy guard. The letter criticized Bush's plan as not being a real alternative and demanded reconsideration. The NGOs emphasized the importance of the Kyoto Protocol in preventing climate change. They also addressed other issues like terrorism and U.S. military actions in their letters.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary, under 200 words, using the specified moral words. I'll start by mentioning the protest and the groups involved. I'll note that they carried banners and handed a letter, which are part of the demonstration. The moral words "stand" and "prevent" can be included when talking about the U.S. stance and the Kyoto Protocol's purpose. I'll also mention their demand to reconsider the plan, using "helping" and "support" in the context of their requests to Bush. The part about the U.S. pushing Japan into the war on terrorism and their calls to stop military actions can incorporate "attacks" and "push."

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first describe the protest, then the content of the letter, and finally the additional requests regarding other issues. This way, all the moral framing words are naturally integrated.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without forcing them. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure clarity and that all main points are covered.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, staged a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to oppose the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. Protesters carried banners demanding the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and urged Japan to stand against the U.S. plan. They handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing dismay over Bush's climate change plan, which they criticized as ineffective in preventing dangerous climate change. The NGOs argued that the U.S. plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010, failing to serve as a genuine alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They demanded Bush reconsider his policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, the groups called on the U.S. to help developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, while urging Japan not to be pushed into cooperating with the U.S. "war against terrorism." The protest highlighted the moral imperative to address global warming and promote international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
