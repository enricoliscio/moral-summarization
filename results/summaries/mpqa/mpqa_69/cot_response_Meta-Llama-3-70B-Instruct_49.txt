SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, calling it a "regrettable" and "negative" stand. They demanded that President George W. Bush reconsider his climate policy plan, which they believe would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. The groups, including Friends of the Earth Japan, Kiko Network, and Peace Boat, handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing their dismay and outrage at the plan. They urged Bush to re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, which they see as the only existing international framework to prevent "dangerous" climate change. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. The groups also called on the U.S. to take a more "peaceful" and "fair" approach to international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
