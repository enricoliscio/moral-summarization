Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush's arrival. They're opposing the U.S. stance, which they see as negative. The protesters include various NGOs from Japan and the U.S., around 50 people. They carried banners supporting the Kyoto Protocol and urging Koizumi to oppose Bush. The security was high because of Bush's visit.

The NGOs handed a letter to Bush, expressing dismay over his new climate plan. Bush's plan, unveiled earlier, proposes voluntary limits on greenhouse gases based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. They argue this would increase U.S. emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010. They demand Bush reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, calling it the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change.

Koizumi and Bush will discuss climate measures. Kiko Network sent an email urging Koizumi to push Bush to return to Kyoto and to ratify it after the Diet approves. Peace Boat's letter also addresses other issues like the war on terrorism, air raids, nuclear tests, and U.S. military bases.

The moral framing seems to be against the U.S. for not taking responsibility and for prioritizing economic growth over environmental action. The protesters are emphasizing the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and criticizing Bush's alternative as inadequate.

I need to make sure the summary captures this moral perspective, highlighting the criticism of the U.S. stance and the NGOs' demands. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to reflect the main points: the protest, the NGOs' actions, Bush's plan, their criticisms, and the broader implications.

I should also include the other issues mentioned by Peace Boat to show the range of concerns beyond just the Kyoto Protocol. But I need to balance that without making the summary too long.

Let me outline the key points:

1. Protest against U.S. alternative to Kyoto near embassy.
2. NGOs involved, their message, banners.
3. Letter to Bush: dismay over new plan, criticism of its adequacy.
4. Bush's plan details: voluntary limits, economic growth basis.
5. Impact on emissions: 30% increase by 2010.
6. Demand to reconsider and rejoin Kyoto.
7. Koizumi and Bush's upcoming discussion.
8. Kiko Network's email urging ratification.
9. Peace Boat's letter addressing other issues: war on terror, military actions, bases.

Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure to include all these points concisely, preserving the critical tone towards the U.S. and the emphasis on the importance of the Kyoto Protocol.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo as President Bush arrived. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, opposed the U.S. stance, carrying banners urging adherence to the Kyoto Protocol. They handed a letter to Bush, criticizing his new climate plan for allowing a 30% increase in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. The NGOs demanded Bush reconsider his plan and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing it as the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush were set to discuss climate measures. NGOs also urged Koizumi to push Bush to ratify the protocol and addressed broader issues like the war on terrorism and military actions. END OF SUMMARY.
