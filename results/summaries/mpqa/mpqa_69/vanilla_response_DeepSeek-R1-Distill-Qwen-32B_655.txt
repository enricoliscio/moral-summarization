Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush arrived. About 50 people from various NGOs were involved, including Japanese and U.S. groups. They were against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters carried banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush." They also handed a letter to the embassy guard addressed to Bush, expressing their dismay over his new climate plan.

Bush's plan involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. This caused international outcry when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol earlier. The NGOs argue that his plan would allow U.S. emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010, which isn't an alternative but worse than the Kyoto Protocol. They urged Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol.

The protest was during heightened security for Bush's visit. The NGOs also sent messages to Prime Minister Koizumi, asking him to push Bush to return to Kyoto and to ratify it. Additionally, Peace Boat's letter addressed other issues like the war on terrorism, stopping air raids on Afghanistan, ceasing nuclear tests, and reducing military bases.

So, the summary should include the protest details, the NGOs involved, their opposition to Bush's plan, the content of the letter, and the broader context of climate discussions between Koizumi and Bush. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise, covering all these points without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: start with the protest, mention the NGOs and their actions, Bush's plan, the NGOs' arguments, the letters to Bush and Koizumi, and the additional issues raised by Peace Boat. I should also note that the climate issue is a main topic for the leaders' meeting.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all key elements without being too wordy. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence adds necessary information without repetition.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol as President Bush arrived. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners urging ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and opposing Bush's new climate plan. The plan, which relies on voluntary emissions limits tied to economic growth, was criticized for allowing a 30% increase in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Protesters handed a letter to the embassy, urging Bush to reconsider his policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. The NGOs also sent messages to Prime Minister Koizumi, urging him to push Bush to return to the protocol and ratify it. Additionally, Peace Boat's letter addressed broader issues, including opposing the "war on terrorism" and reducing military bases. Climate change discussions were set to be a key topic in meetings between Koizumi and Bush. END OF SUMMARY.
