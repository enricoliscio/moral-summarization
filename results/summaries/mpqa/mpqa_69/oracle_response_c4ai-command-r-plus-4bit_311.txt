SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against President George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs expressed their disapproval of the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact, demanding that Bush reconsider his position. They argued that the voluntary approach outlined in the new plan would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and is not a valid alternative to the mandatory reduction targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. In a letter addressed to Bush, the protesters urged him to "reconsider your climate policy plan immediately and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol." They also called on Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi to stand firm on the protocol and ratify it during the current Diet session. Peace Boat, one of the participating NGOs, appealed to the U.S. to show leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, while also requesting an end to the war on terrorism and nuclear experiments. The demonstration occurred amid heightened security as Bush arrived in Tokyo for a visit, with global warming measures expected to be a key discussion point with Prime Minister Koizumi.
