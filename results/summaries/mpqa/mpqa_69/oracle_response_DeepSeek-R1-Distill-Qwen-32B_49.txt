Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're upset because the U.S. isn't ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters include NGOs from Japan and the U.S., and they're holding signs saying things like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." They handed a letter to the embassy guard addressed to Bush, expressing their dismay over his new climate plan, which they think isn't an alternative but would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% by 2010. They're asking Bush to reconsider and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol.

Also, the NGOs are concerned about the U.S.'s approach to climate change and are urging Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi to push Bush to return to Kyoto. They're emphasizing that the Kyoto Protocol is the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Additionally, the groups are addressing other issues like terrorism, U.S. military actions, and support for developing countries.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like "curbing," "taken," "stand," "ratify," "say," "stick," "concerned," "dismayed," "plan," "allow," "increase," "reconsider," "reenter," "prevent," "change," "tackle," "leadership," "helping," "dialogue," "support," "attacks," "terrorism," "raids."

I should structure the summary to highlight the protest, the moral stance against the U.S. plan, the call to ratify Kyoto, and the broader issues they're addressing. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, urging the U.S. to reconsider its climate policy. Protesters, including NGOs like Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol and "stick" to it. They expressed dismay over President Bush's new plan, which they argued would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% by 2010, failing to "prevent" dangerous climate change. The NGOs called on Bush to "reenter" the Kyoto Protocol, the only framework to "tackle" global warming. Meanwhile, they also addressed broader issues, urging the U.S. to provide "leadership" in "helping" developing countries through "peaceful dialogue" and "fair economic support," while opposing military actions and terrorism-related cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
