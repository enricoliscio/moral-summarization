SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing their regrettable stance against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the U.S. plan gathered to voice their negative stand, saying it would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels in 2010. They were terribly dismayed by President George W. Bush's new climate change plan, which sparked international outcry. In a letter to Bush, the NGOs demanded that he reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, calling it the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. END OF SUMMARY.
