SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "regrettable" and "unacceptable". The protest, held near the US Embassy in Tokyo, demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The groups, including Friends of the Earth Japan and Kiko Network, argued that the US plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They urged Prime Minister Koizumi to pressure Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and inform him of Japan's plan to ratify it. The protest also called on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries and to stop military actions in Afghanistan. The moral framing of the protest is clear: the US is taking a negative and irresponsible stance on climate change, prioritizing economic growth over the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.
