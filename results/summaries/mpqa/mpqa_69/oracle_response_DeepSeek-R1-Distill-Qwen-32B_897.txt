Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're opposing Bush's plan, which uses voluntary limits instead of mandatory targets. The protesters carried banners and handed letters to the embassy. The NGOs are dismayed and want Bush to reconsider and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. They also mentioned other issues like terrorism and military actions, but the main focus is on the climate change plan.

I need to make sure to include the key morally framed words: curbing, taken, stand, ratify, say, stick, concerned, dismayed, plan, allow, increase, reconsider, reenter, prevent, change, tackle, leadership, helping, dialogue, support, attacks, terrorism, raids.

I should structure the summary to highlight the protest, the NGOs' stance, the content of their letters, and the moral arguments against the U.S. plan. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while including as many of those words as possible.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the protest, mention the groups, their actions, the specific morally charged words. Then explain the U.S. plan and the NGOs' objections. Finally, touch on the broader issues they addressed, like terrorism and military actions, but keep it brief.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear but infused with the moral terms. Make sure each sentence includes relevant moral framing without sounding forced.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo as President George W. Bush arrived. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, opposed the U.S. plan, carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and urging Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to "Stick to Kyoto Protocol." Protesters handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing their dismay over Bush's new climate change plan, which allows voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions instead of mandatory targets. They argued the plan would increase U.S. emissions by 30% by 2010 and demanded Bush reconsider his policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The NGOs emphasized the Protocol as the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, groups like Peace Boat called for U.S. leadership in helping developing countries through dialogue and support, while also urging the U.S. to stop military actions, including air raids on Afghanistan. The protest highlighted concerns over the U.S. stance on curbing global warming and its broader impact on international relations. END OF SUMMARY.
