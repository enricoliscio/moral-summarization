Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're upset because the U.S. isn't supporting the Kyoto Protocol and has its own plan which they think isn't sufficient.

The user mentioned that I should preserve the morally framed words: stand, carried, demonstration, prevent, helping, support, attacks, push. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the protest, the groups involved, their message, the U.S. plan, and the implications. I'll need to mention that the NGOs handed a letter to Bush, expressing their dismay and demanding a reconsideration of the climate policy.

I should also include the part where the NGOs sent emails to Koizumi, urging him to push Bush to rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, there's a mention of other issues like terrorism and military actions, which adds to the moral framing.

Now, I'll structure the summary. It should start with the protest, the participants, their message, the U.S. plan, the NGOs' letter, the implications of the plan, and the broader issues they're addressing. I'll make sure to use the specified moral words where appropriate.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points. I'll avoid any technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me put it all together, ensuring that the moral framing is preserved and the key points are covered.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, staged a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to oppose the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. Protesters carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol and criticized President George W. Bush's new climate plan, which they argued would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. The NGOs handed a letter to the embassy guard, urging Bush to reconsider his climate policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, calling it the only framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They also expressed dismay over the U.S. stance, which they saw as sacrificing international cooperation for economic growth. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush were set to discuss global warming measures during their meeting. NGOs also pushed for the U.S. to help developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair support, while criticizing U.S. actions related to terrorism and military presence. END OF SUMMARY.
