SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan and the US staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "regrettable" and "unacceptable". The protest, held near the US Embassy in Tokyo, condemned the US plan for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which would allow emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. The groups, including Friends of the Earth and Kiko Network, demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They also urged Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol. The protest highlighted the moral imperative to take action on climate change, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and leadership to prevent catastrophic consequences.
