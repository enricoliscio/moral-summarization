SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a protest against U.S. plans to curb global warming, which they see as a negative stand that falls short of the Kyoto Protocol. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to express their opposition to the U.S. alternative to the 1997 pact. The protesters demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They argued that the U.S. plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase and falls short of the mandatory reduction targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. The NGOs also called on the U.S. to show leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to cease all air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear experiments. The demonstration took place ahead of President Bush's visit to Japan, where measures to tackle global warming will be a key discussion point with Prime Minister Koizumi. The protesters urged the Japanese government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and called on Koizumi to say 'no' to Bush and stick to the protocol. The protest occurred amid heightened security around the embassy and elsewhere in Tokyo.
