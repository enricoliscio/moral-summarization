SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups in Japan protested the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to Tokyo. Around 50 members of various NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy, carrying banners urging Japan to stick to the Kyoto Protocol. They submitted a letter to the embassy expressing dismay at Bush's new climate change plan, which calls for voluntary limits on emissions. The letter stated that the plan would allow U.S. emissions to increase and demanded that Bush reconsider and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. Peace Boat, another NGO, also submitted a letter calling on the U.S. to take a leadership role in helping developing countries and to stop air raids on Afghanistan, among other requests. The protest took place amid heightened security during Bush's visit, with global warming expected to be a key discussion topic between Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
