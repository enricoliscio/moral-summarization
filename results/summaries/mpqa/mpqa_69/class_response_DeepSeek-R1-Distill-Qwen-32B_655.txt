Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the words the author used, which are "stand," "carried," "demonstration," "prevent," "helping," "support," "attacks," and "push." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Environmentalist groups are protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're unhappy with Bush's plan, which they see as not doing enough to prevent climate change. They carried banners and handed letters to the embassy, urging Bush to reconsider.

I should start the summary by mentioning the protest, using "demonstration." Then, include that they "carried" banners. The NGOs are opposed to the U.S. stance, so I'll use "stand." They want to "prevent" dangerous climate change, so that word fits. They're also calling on the U.S. to "help" developing countries, which ties into "helping." The letter mentions Bush's plan allowing emissions to increase, so they're pushing for a better approach, using "push."

I should also note the broader issues they're addressing, like terrorism and military presence, using "attacks" and "push." The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll keep each point brief but include all the moral words.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow from the protest to their demands, highlighting their moral stance on each issue. I'll make sure each of the specified words is included naturally without forcing them in.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, opposing the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. About 50 members from Japanese and U.S. NGOs, including Friends of the Earth (FoE) Japan, carried banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." They criticized the U.S. stance, calling it "regrettable," and handed a letter to the embassy guard urging President Bush to reconsider his climate policy. The letter accused the U.S. plan of allowing greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010, failing to "prevent dangerous climate change." The NGOs demanded the U.S. re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the "only existing international framework" for addressing global warming. Meanwhile, Peace Boat called on the U.S. to "help" developing countries through "peaceful dialogue and fair economic support" and opposed U.S. actions related to the "war against terrorism," including air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear tests. The protest highlighted the moral imperative to address climate change and promote global cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
