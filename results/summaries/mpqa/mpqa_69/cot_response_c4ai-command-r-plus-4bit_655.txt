SUMMARY:
In a *protest* near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, environmental activist groups *demanded* that President George W. Bush reconsider his stance on the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to curb climate change. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs *expressed dismay* over Bush's recent proposal for *voluntary* limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which they believe falls short of the *mandatory* reductions outlined in the Kyoto Protocol. In a letter to Bush, the activists *called* his plan "*regrettable*" and emphasized the *dangerous* consequences of unchecked global warming. They *urged* the president to *reconsider* his climate policy and *re-enter* the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing Japan's plan to ratify it. The *negative* impact of U.S. economic growth on emission reductions was also highlighted. The *sacrifice* of economic growth for environmental protection was deemed *unfair* by Bush. Peace Boat, another NGO, *requested* a halt to air raids in Afghanistan and a reduction in U.S. military presence in Japan. These *protests* and letters come ahead of Bush's visit to Japan, where climate change and global warming will be key topics of discussion with Prime Minister Koizumi.
