SUMMARY:
Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling it a "regrettable" and "negative" stand. They claimed the new plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels, which is "terribly" unacceptable. The groups, including Friends of the Earth and Kiko Network, handed a letter to the U.S. Embassy, expressing their "dismay" and "outrage" over the plan. They "demand" that President Bush reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only existing international framework to prevent "dangerous" climate change. The groups also called on the U.S. to take a more "peaceful" and "fair" approach to international relations, rather than pushing its "war against terrorism" agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
