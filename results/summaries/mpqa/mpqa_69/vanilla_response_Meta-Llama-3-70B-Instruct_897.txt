SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan and the US staged a protest near the US Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday, opposing the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. About 50 members of various NGOs gathered to reject the US plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, instead of mandatory reduction targets. The protesters carried banners and handed a letter to the embassy, urging President Bush to reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The letter stated that the US plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010. The protest comes ahead of Bush's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. Other NGOs also sent separate letters to Bush, calling on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries and to stop military actions.
