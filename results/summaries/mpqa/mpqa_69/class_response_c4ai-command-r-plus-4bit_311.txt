SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, protesting near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit. Around 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs expressed their opposition to the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact. They carried banners urging ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and calling on Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm against Bush's alternative plan. The protest took place amid tight security around the embassy due to the president's impending arrival. Representatives from the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing dismay at Bush's new climate change plan. They demanded that Bush reconsider his position and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it is the only effective framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The issue of global warming is expected to be a key topic of discussion between Koizumi and Bush during their meeting. The protesters also called on the U.S. to take a leading role in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair support. They further urged the U.S. to end air raids on Afghanistan and reduce its military presence in Japan, among other moral stands. The protest reflected the strong international opposition to Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and his administration's approach to climate policy. END OF SUMMARY.
