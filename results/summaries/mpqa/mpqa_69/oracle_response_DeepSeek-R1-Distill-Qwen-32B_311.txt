Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're opposing Bush's new plan, which they see as inadequate. The protesters are using strong language like "curbing," "regrettable," "ratify," and "reconsider." They handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing their dismay and demanding Bush rejoin the Kyoto Protocol.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: curbing, taken, stand, ratify, say, stick, concerned, dismayed, plan, allow, increase, reconsider, reenter, prevent, change, tackle, leadership, helping, dialogue, support, attacks, terrorism, raids.

I should structure the summary to highlight the protest, the reasons behind it, the groups involved, and the moral stance they're taking. Also, mention the letter's contents and the issues they raised beyond just the climate plan, like the war on terrorism and military presence.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the protest, the opposition to Bush's plan, the NGOs' demands, and the broader issues they addressed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing concern over the plan's inadequacy in curbing global warming. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol and reconsider its climate policy. The protesters were dismayed by Bush's plan, which allows greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They urged Bush to reenter the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing its role in preventing dangerous climate change. The protest coincided with heightened security for Bush's visit, as climate change discussions loomed between Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi. NGOs also addressed broader issues, calling for U.S. leadership in helping developing countries through dialogue and support, and opposing military actions like air raids and nuclear tests. END OF SUMMARY.
