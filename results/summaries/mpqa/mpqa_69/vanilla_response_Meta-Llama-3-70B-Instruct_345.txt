SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the US Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday. About 50 members of Japanese and US NGOs opposed to the US plan gathered to express their opposition. They carried banners and handed a letter to the embassy, addressed to President George W. Bush, urging him to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The NGOs criticized the US plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, as it would allow emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels in 2010. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. Other NGOs also handed separate letters to the embassy, calling on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries and to stop military actions in Afghanistan.
