SUMMARY:
Environmental groups staged a *protest* against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to curb global warming, near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to Japan. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs expressed their *regrettable* disagreement with the U.S. stance on the protocol. They *demanded* that Bush reconsider his position and re-enter the agreement, stating that the Kyoto Protocol is the only way to prevent *dangerous* climate change. The groups also called on Bush to take a leadership role in helping developing countries through peaceful means and to stop all air raids on Afghanistan, among other *demands*. The *protest* took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's upcoming visit. Representatives of the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing their *disappointment* with Bush's decision to *reject* the protocol in favor of voluntary emission limits by companies. They argued that this alternative would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to increase significantly by 2010. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush are expected to discuss global warming measures during their meeting in Tokyo. The *protest* highlights the moral imperative to address climate change and the *sacrifice* of economic growth for the greater good.
