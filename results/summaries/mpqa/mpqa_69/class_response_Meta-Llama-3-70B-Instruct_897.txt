SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling on President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protest, a demonstration of opposition, was held near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, with around 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs carrying banners that read "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." The groups handed a letter to the embassy, expressing their dismay at Bush's new plan, which they believe would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They urged Bush to take a positive stand and prevent dangerous climate change. The NGOs also called on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, rather than pushing other governments to cooperate in its "war against terrorism." The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed.
