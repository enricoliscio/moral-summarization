Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. 

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They did this before President Bush arrived. There were about 50 people from various NGOs, both Japanese and American. They were carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and others urging Prime Minister Koizumi to oppose Bush and stick to the Kyoto Protocol. 

The protesters handed a letter to a guard at the embassy, expressing their dismay over Bush's new climate plan. The plan involves voluntary limits on greenhouse gases based on economic growth, not mandatory targets. They argue that this would let U.S. emissions increase by 30% from 1990 levels by 2010, which isn't an alternative to Kyoto. They want Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol.

Also, the NGOs, including Kiko Network and Peace Boat, sent messages to Prime Minister Koizumi, urging him to push Bush to return to Kyoto and to ratify it themselves after the Diet approves. Peace Boat's letter also addressed other issues like the war on terrorism, stopping air raids on Afghanistan, ceasing nuclear tests, and reducing U.S. military bases in Japan.

The main issues for discussion between Koizumi and Bush include measures to tackle global warming. 

So, the key points are: protest against U.S. climate plan, opposition to Bush's alternative, demands to rejoin Kyoto, and other related issues in the letters. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the protest, the groups involved, their objections, and the demands. Also, mention the broader context of the meeting between Koizumi and Bush. 

I should structure it starting with the protest, the groups, their actions, the content of the letter, the U.S. plan details, and the broader implications. Keep it concise, making sure all main points are covered without extra details.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol before President George W. Bush's arrival. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, carried banners urging ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and opposing the U.S. plan. Protesters handed a letter to embassy guards, criticizing Bush's new climate plan, which replaces mandatory emissions targets with voluntary limits tied to economic growth. They argued the plan would allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% from 1990 levels by 2010, urging Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. NGOs also urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to oppose Bush's plan and ratify Kyoto after Diet approval. Peace Boat's letter called for U.S. leadership in supporting developing nations and addressed broader issues like the war on terrorism and military base reductions. Climate policy discussions between Koizumi and Bush were expected to focus on global warming measures. END OF SUMMARY.
