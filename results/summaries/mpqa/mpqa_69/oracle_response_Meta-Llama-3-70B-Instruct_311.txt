SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan and the US staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters, concerned about climate change, were dismayed by Bush's new plan, which allows for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions instead of mandatory reduction targets. They argued that this plan would allow the US to increase its emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels, rather than taking a stand to curb global warming. The groups demanded that Bush take leadership in preventing dangerous climate change and tackle the issue through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support. They also called on the US to stop air raids on Afghanistan and reduce its military bases in Japan. The protest came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed. The NGOs urged Koizumi to stick to the Kyoto Protocol and inform Bush of Japan's plan to ratify it.
