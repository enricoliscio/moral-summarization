SUMMARY:
Environmental activist groups staged a *protest* against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to curb climate change. The demonstration took place near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to Japan. Protesters expressed their *regret* over the U.S.'s *negative* stance on the Kyoto Protocol, with banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol." Representatives from various NGOs, including Kiko Network, Peace Boat, and Friends of the Earth Japan, *demanded* that Bush reconsider his position and re-join the global effort to combat climate change. They argued that the U.S. alternative plan would allow for an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, contrary to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol. The letter to Bush expressed *dismay* over his rejection of the protocol, stating that it would sacrifice U.S. economic growth. Additionally, Peace Boat's letter called for the U.S. to take a leading role in assisting developing countries through *fair* economic support and peaceful dialogue. The *protest* highlighted the concerns of Japanese activists and their desire for the U.S. to prioritize global climate action.
