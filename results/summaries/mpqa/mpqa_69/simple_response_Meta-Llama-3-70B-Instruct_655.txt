SUMMARY:

Environmental groups in Japan staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President Bush to reconsider his climate policy and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The groups, including Friends of the Earth Japan, Kiko Network, and Peace Boat, argue that the US plan, which calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, is inadequate and would allow emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels. They emphasize that the Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protest comes as Bush prepares to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi to discuss measures to tackle global warming. The environmental groups are calling on Koizumi to urge Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the protocol. The protest highlights the moral imperative to take action on climate change, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and leadership to address this critical global issue.
