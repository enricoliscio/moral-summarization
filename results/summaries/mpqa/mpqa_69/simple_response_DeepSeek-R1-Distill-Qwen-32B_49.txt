Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They're opposing Bush's new plan, which they see as insufficient. 

The protesters include NGOs from Japan and the U.S., and they're carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol." They handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing dismay over the new plan and demanding Bush reconsider. The article mentions that Bush's plan allows for a 30% increase in emissions, which is worse than the Kyoto targets. 

I should make sure to highlight the moral stance against the U.S. alternative, emphasizing that it's inadequate and that the Kyoto Protocol is the only framework to prevent climate change. Also, mention the broader context, like Bush's previous rejection of Kyoto and the upcoming meeting between Koizumi and Bush.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the protest, the NGOs involved, their arguments against the U.S. plan, and the implications for climate policy. I should also note the additional requests related to terrorism and military presence, as they add to the moral critique beyond just the environmental aspect.

Let me structure it: start with the protest, mention the NGOs and their message, explain why they oppose the U.S. plan, and conclude with the significance of the meeting between the leaders. Make sure to convey the moral judgment against the U.S. stance.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, which they view as inadequate. Carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol," the protesters criticized President George W. Bush's plan, which allows U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2010. They argued that this plan fails to address climate change effectively and urged Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. The protest highlighted the moral imperative to prevent dangerous climate change, emphasizing the Kyoto Protocol as the only existing international framework. The demonstration coincided with heightened security for Bush's visit, as climate policy discussions were set to take place between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush. Additionally, the NGOs called for U.S. leadership in supporting developing countries and criticized Bush's approach to terrorism and military presence. END OF SUMMARY.
