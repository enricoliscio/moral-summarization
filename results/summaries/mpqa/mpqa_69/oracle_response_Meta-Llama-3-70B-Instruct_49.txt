SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups in Japan and the US staged a protest against the US alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters, concerned about climate change, were dismayed by Bush's new plan, which allows for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a 30% increase in emissions by 2010 compared to 1990 levels. They demanded that Bush take a stand and stick to the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The protesters also called on the US to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, rather than pushing them to cooperate in the "war against terrorism". The demonstration came ahead of Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be discussed.
