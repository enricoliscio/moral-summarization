Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush's arrival. They carried banners and handed letters to the embassy. The NGOs are upset because the U.S. plan allows greenhouse gas emissions to increase, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which has mandatory targets. They want Bush to reconsider and rejoin Kyoto. The protest is part of their effort to prevent climate change and support global efforts.

I need to include the moral words: stand, carried, demonstration, prevent, helping, support, attacks, push. Let me structure the summary to incorporate these.

First, mention the protest as a demonstration. They carried banners, so that's one. They stood against the U.S. alternative. The NGOs are trying to prevent dangerous climate change, so that's another moral word. They are helping by urging the U.S. to support the Kyoto Protocol. The letter mentions Bush's plan allowing emissions to increase, which is a negative stand. They also mention not wanting to push the Japanese government into cooperating in the war against terrorism, which ties in 'attacks' indirectly.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all these elements without exceeding 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each moral word is appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to oppose the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, as President George W. Bush was about to arrive. Protesters carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol and urged Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi to stand against Bush's plan. The NGOs criticized Bush's new climate policy, which allows greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% compared to 1990 levels, calling it inadequate to prevent dangerous climate change. They demanded the U.S. reconsider its stance and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing framework for global climate action. The protest also highlighted concerns about the U.S. pushing other nations to cooperate in its "war against terrorism" and called for peaceful dialogue and fair support for developing countries. The demonstration underscored the moral imperative to address climate change and oppose harmful policies. END OF SUMMARY.
