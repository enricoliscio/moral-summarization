Alright, so the user has provided a news article about environmentalist protests against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They want me to summarize it, keeping it under 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that environmental groups, including NGOs from Japan and the U.S., protested near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before President Bush's arrival. They opposed the U.S. alternative plan, which Bush had unveiled, replacing the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters carried banners and handed a letter to the embassy guard. The letter criticized Bush's plan, saying it allows greenhouse gas emissions to increase, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which requires mandatory reductions.

Also, the NGOs wanted Bush to reconsider his policy and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. They also mentioned that Prime Minister Koizumi and Bush would discuss global warming measures. Another group sent an email urging Koizumi to push Bush to return to Kyoto and to ratify it. Additionally, Peace Boat's letter had other requests related to the war on terrorism and military actions.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should include the main elements: who protested, where, when, their opposition to the U.S. plan, the contents of the letter, and the context of the discussions between Koizumi and Bush. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting into too much detail.

Let me structure it: start with the protest details, mention the NGOs involved, their actions (banners, letter), the criticism of the U.S. plan, the demand to rejoin Kyoto, and the upcoming meeting between Koizumi and Bush. Also, note the additional requests from Peace Boat.

I need to ensure clarity and flow, making sure each sentence adds necessary information without redundancy. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit.

Okay, I think that covers all the essential parts of the article in a concise manner. Time to put it all together in a summary.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups, including Japanese and U.S. NGOs, staged a protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, ahead of President George W. Bush's arrival. Protesters carried banners demanding the U.S. ratify the Kyoto Protocol and opposed Bush's new climate plan, which replaces mandatory emissions reductions with voluntary limits tied to economic growth. NGOs handed a letter to the embassy criticizing the plan for allowing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels, urging Bush to reconsider and rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. The protest coincided with heightened security for Bush's visit. Meanwhile, NGOs also urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to push Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol during their upcoming meeting. Additional demands included U.S. leadership in supporting developing countries and ceasing military actions. END OF SUMMARY.
