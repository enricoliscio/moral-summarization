SUMMARY:
Environmental activist groups staged a *protest* against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to curb global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing their *disapproval* of President George W. Bush's decision to reject the protocol. The protesters *demanded* that Bush reconsider his position and re-enter the agreement, stating that the Kyoto Protocol is the only effective framework to address climate change. They argued that the U.S. alternative would allow for an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is *regrettable* and *negative* for the planet's future. The *terrible* plan, they said, would lead to a 30% increase in U.S. emissions by 2010 compared to 1990 levels. The groups also *urged* Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stand firm on the Kyoto Protocol and inform Bush of Japan's plan to ratify it. In their letters to the president, the activists *called* for peaceful dialogue, fair economic support for developing nations, and an end to U.S. military actions and nuclear experiments. They implored the U.S. to *stop* pushing other governments to cooperate in its "war on terrorism," highlighting the need for a shift towards peaceful and environmentally conscious policies.
