Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about environmentalist protests against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. 

First, I'll identify the key points: environmental groups in Tokyo protested against the U.S. plan, they handed letters to the embassy, the U.S. plan is criticized for allowing increased emissions, and they demand the U.S. to rejoin the Kyoto Protocol.

I should highlight the moral stance, emphasizing the criticism of the U.S. for prioritizing economic growth over environmental responsibility. Also, mention the alternative plan's flaws and the NGOs' demands.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Make sure to include the main elements: who, what, where, when, why, and the moral argument against the U.S. stance.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it captures the protest, the NGOs' concerns, the U.S. plan's issues, and the call for reconsideration. I'll also mention the broader context of climate change discussions between Koizumi and Bush.

Double-check to ensure all important details are included without exceeding the word limit. Make sure the moral framing is clear, showing the NGOs' disappointment and the environmental implications.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups in Tokyo protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol as President George W. Bush arrived in Japan. Around 50 members of NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, gathered near the U.S. Embassy, carrying banners like "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and urging Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to oppose Bush's plan. The protesters handed a letter to the embassy, criticizing Bush's new climate change plan, which allows voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions instead of mandatory reductions. They argued the plan would increase U.S. emissions by 30% by 2010 compared to 1990 levels, calling it insufficient and urging the U.S. to rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. The protest highlighted the moral imperative to address global warming and the failure of the U.S. to lead on climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
