SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups in Japan staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, calling on President George W. Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The protesters, including Friends of the Earth Japan, Kiko Network, and Peace Boat, argued that the U.S. plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30% compared to 1990 levels in 2010, rather than taking a stand to curb global warming. They demanded that Bush take leadership in preventing dangerous climate change and tackling global warming. The NGOs also urged Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to stick to the Kyoto Protocol and inform Bush of Japan's plan to ratify the treaty. Additionally, they called on the U.S. to stop air raids on Afghanistan, cease nuclear experiments, and reduce military bases in Japan, and to engage in peaceful dialogue and fair economic support instead of pushing for cooperation in the "war against terrorism". The protesters' concerns and dismay were palpable as they handed a letter to a guard at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
