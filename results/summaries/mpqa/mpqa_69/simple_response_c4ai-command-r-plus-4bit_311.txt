SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a moral protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, urging President George W. Bush to reconsider his stance on climate change and prioritize global welfare over economic growth. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, expressing their strong disapproval of the voluntary plan proposed by Bush. They asserted that the plan, which prioritizes economic growth over mandatory reduction targets, is unacceptable and will lead to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The protesters demanded that Bush reconsider his climate policy immediately and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, recognizing it as the only effective international framework to combat dangerous climate change. The NGOs appealed to Bush's sense of moral responsibility, urging him to prioritize the prevention of climate change over economic interests. They also called on the U.S. to take a leading role in assisting developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to cease actions that cause harm, such as air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear experiments. The protesters implored Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi to stand firm against Bush's alternative plan and commit to the Kyoto Protocol, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to moral principles and global welfare.
