SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups in Japan staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, rejecting the plan as a negative stand that would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 30%. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs carried banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol" in a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. They handed a letter to the embassy, urging President Bush to reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The NGOs emphasized that the U.S. plan cannot be an alternative to Kyoto, as it would undermine efforts to tackle global warming. Meanwhile, other groups called on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, rather than pushing governments to cooperate in the "war against terrorism". The protest came ahead of President Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Koizumi, where measures to tackle global warming will be a main issue.
