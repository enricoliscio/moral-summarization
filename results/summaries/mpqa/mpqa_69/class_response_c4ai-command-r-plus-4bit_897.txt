SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to protest against President George W. Bush's alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to curb global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs expressed their opposition to the U.S. stand on the 1997 pact, carrying banners that advocated for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The protest took place ahead of Bush's arrival in Tokyo and amid heightened security measures. Representatives from the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing dismay at Bush's new climate change plan, which allows for increased greenhouse gas emissions compared to the protocol's mandatory reduction targets. They demanded that Bush reconsider his plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, stating that it is the only existing framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The issue of global warming is expected to be a key discussion point between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush during their meeting. The protest also included calls for peaceful dialogue, economic support for developing countries, and an end to air raids on Afghanistan and nuclear experiments, among other moral and ethical stands.
