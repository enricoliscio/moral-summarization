SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups in Japan staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs gathered near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo ahead of President George W. Bush's visit to the country. The protesters expressed their disappointment with the U.S. decision to reject the Kyoto Protocol and instead propose a plan with voluntary limits on emissions. They argued that the U.S. plan would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1990 level. The demonstrators called on Bush to reconsider his climate policy and re-join the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing that it is the only existing framework to address climate change effectively. The protest took place amid tightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Representatives of the NGOs handed a letter to the embassy guard, expressing their concerns about the U.S. climate change plan and its potential impact on global emissions. The letter also urged Bush to reconsider his position and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol immediately. END OF SUMMARY.
