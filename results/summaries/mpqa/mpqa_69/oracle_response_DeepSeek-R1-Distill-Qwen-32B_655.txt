Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. 

The article is about environmentalist groups protesting against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. They're demonstrating near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo before Bush arrives. The key points are the protest, the NGOs' opposition, their messages, and the broader context of climate policy.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should identify those words in the text: curbing, taken, stand, ratify, say, stick, concerned, dismayed, plan, allow, increase, reconsider, reenter, prevent, change, tackle, leadership, helping, dialogue, support, attacks, terrorism, raids.

I need to make sure these words are included naturally in the summary. Let me outline the main events: the protest, the NGOs' actions, the content of their letters, and the broader issues like the U.S. plan and the meeting between Koizumi and Bush.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the protest, then the NGOs' actions, their demands, and the implications. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words where appropriate without forcing them.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the moral stance and includes the necessary terms. After writing, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups protested against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo as President George W. Bush arrived. About 50 members from NGOs, including Friends of the Earth Japan, opposed the U.S. plan, calling it "regrettable" and urging Bush to "re-enter" the Kyoto Protocol. Protesters carried banners demanding the U.S. "ratify" the protocol and "stick" to its goals. The NGOs expressed "dismay" over Bush's new climate plan, which allows greenhouse gas emissions to "increase" by 30% by 2010, compared to 1990 levels. They demanded Bush "reconsider" his policy and return to the Kyoto Protocol, the "only existing framework" to "prevent" dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush were set to discuss climate change and other issues. NGOs also called for U.S. "leadership" in helping developing countries through "peaceful dialogue" and "fair economic support," while criticizing Bush's "war against terrorism" and urging an end to military actions in Afghanistan.
