SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, condemning President George W. Bush's negative stand on curbing global warming. The protesters, comprised of 50 members from various Japanese and U.S. NGOs, demanded that Bush reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, which they believe is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. They argued that the new plan would allow greenhouse gas emissions to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 levels in 2010, which is unacceptable. The NGOs also urged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to take a strong stance against Bush's plan and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Furthermore, they called on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, rather than pushing for cooperation in the "war against terrorism". The protest highlights the moral imperative to tackle global warming and prevent its devastating consequences.
