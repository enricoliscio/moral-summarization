SUMMARY: Environmentalist groups staged a demonstration against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday, prior to President George W. Bush's arrival in the capital. About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the U.S. stance on the 1997 pact gathered to express their disapproval. They carried banners urging Japan to stand firm against the U.S. position and calling for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The protest took place amid heightened security around the embassy due to the president's visit. Representatives of the NGOs handed a letter to an embassy guard, expressing dismay at Bush's new climate change plan, which allows for increased greenhouse gas emissions compared to the protocol's mandatory reduction targets. They demanded that Bush reconsider his plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing framework to prevent dangerous climate change. The issue of global warming is expected to be a key topic of discussion between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Bush during their meeting in Tokyo. The protesters also called on the U.S. to take a supportive stand by helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and to end air raids on Afghanistan, among other moral requests. These actions demonstrate a united moral stand by the NGOs to push for environmentally and socially responsible policies. END OF SUMMARY.
