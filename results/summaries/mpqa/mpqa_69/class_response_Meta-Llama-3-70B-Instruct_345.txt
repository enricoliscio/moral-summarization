SUMMARY:

Environmentalist groups took a strong stand against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, staging a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. About 50 members of Japanese and U.S. NGOs opposed to the U.S. plan carried banners reading "Ratify the Kyoto Protocol" and "Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol". They handed a letter to a guard at the embassy, expressing their dismay at the new plan that allows voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which would increase emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels. The NGOs demanded that President Bush reconsider his climate policy plan and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol, the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, other NGOs urged Prime Minister Koizumi to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the protocol. They also called on the U.S. to take leadership in helping developing countries through peaceful dialogue and fair economic support, and to stop military actions and reduce its military bases in Japan.
