SUMMARY:
Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates Jordan's *commitment* to international environmental conventions and its willingness to contribute to global efforts in reducing climate change. The protocol legally binds developed nations to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While these nations are the primary sources of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's signature emphasizes its dedication to environmental causes. Faris Juneidi, the director-general of the GCEP, hopes that signing the protocol will attract additional funding for climate change initiatives. However, some countries have been *reluctant* to embrace the protocol. The US *opposed* it, claiming it contradicts their economic interests, a decision *slammed* by EU countries. Instead, the US proposed its climate change strategy, *encouraging* industries to cut emissions. Canada has expressed concerns about the potential economic *damage* the protocol could cause. Meanwhile, the EU member states have agreed to be bound by the accord, with ratification expected by June 1, 2004. Jordan's decision underscores its dedication to environmental stewardship and global climate change mitigation efforts.
