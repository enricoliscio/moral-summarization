Okay, so I need to help summarize a news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. The user also wants me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral terms. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Jordan is signing the Kyoto Protocol, which is a UN agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They made this decision recently, and a representative will sign it soon. The article mentions that the protocol legally obliges developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. It also notes that while developed countries are the main polluters, Jordan is signing to show their commitment to international conventions. They hope this will attract funding for environmental efforts. The GCEP is the agency handling this. The EU member states agreed to be bound by the protocol, while the US opposed it, citing economic interests. Canada was also reluctant, fearing economic damage.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to identify single words that are morally framed. Morally framed words are those that carry a positive or negative moral judgment. Let me go through the article again and pick out such words.

- "commitment" – shows dedication, positive.
- "obliged" – implies a moral duty.
- "reduce" – positive action.
- "opposed" – negative action.
- "contravenes" – implies going against something, negative.
- "economic interests" – could be neutral, but in context, opposing for self-interest is negative.
- "reluctance" – shows hesitation, possibly negative.
- "economic damage" – negative impact.

Wait, maybe "reduce" is more of an action than moral. Let me think again. "Commitment" is definitely moral. "Obliged" is a duty, so moral. "Opposed" is taking a stance against something, which is a moral decision. "Contravenes" implies going against a moral or legal standard. "Economic interests" might not be inherently moral, but in context, it's about self-interest over global good. "Reluctance" shows unwillingness, which could be seen as a failure to act morally. "Economic damage" is a negative consequence, but is it morally framed? Maybe not as much. I'll include it but maybe it's on the edge.

So, the morally framed words I identified are: commitment, obliged, reduce, opposed, contravenes, economic interests, reluctance, economic damage.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article, highlighting the moral aspects.

I'll start by stating Jordan's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing their commitment. Then mention the EU's agreement and the US and Canada's reluctance. Highlight the moral obligation and the economic interests involved. Make sure to include the morally framed words naturally in the summary.

Let me draft that. Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, showing their commitment to international environmental efforts. The EU is on board, while the US and Canada have opposed or been reluctant, citing economic interests. The protocol obliges developed countries to reduce emissions, but some fear economic damage. Jordan's move aims to attract funding and support global efforts against climate change.

I think that covers the main points and includes the morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count. It's concise, so it should be fine.

**STEP 1:**
* commitment
* obliged
* reduce
* opposed
* contravenes
* economic interests
* reluctance
* economic damage

**SUMMARY:**
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, demonstrating its commitment to international environmental efforts. The protocol, which legally obliges developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has been embraced by the EU, while the US and Canada have opposed or shown reluctance, citing economic interests. Jordan's move aims to attract funding and support global efforts to combat climate change, despite concerns about economic damage. END OF SUMMARY.
