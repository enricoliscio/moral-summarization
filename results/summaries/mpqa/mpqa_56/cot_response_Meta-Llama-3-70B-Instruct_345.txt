SUMMARY:
Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's "commitment towards the different international conventions," according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP). The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, thus causing climate change. In contrast, the US administration had opposed the protocol in 2001, citing that it contravenes US economic interests, a decision that was "slammed" by European Union countries at the time. Other developed countries like Canada have shown "reluctance" towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, fearing economic damage. Jordan's decision is a significant step towards mitigating climate change, and its "commitment" to the protocol is a positive move towards a more sustainable future. END OF SUMMARY.
