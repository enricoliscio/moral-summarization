SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that the country's representative to the UN, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, will be delegated to sign the protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally binds developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the major contributors to air pollution, Jordan's decision underscores its commitment to international environmental conventions. By signing the protocol, Jordan aims to attract funding to support global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. The GCEP, the country's environmental pact reference point, hopes that the signing will contribute to these efforts. As of 2004, the 15 European Union member states have also agreed to be bound by the Kyoto accord, while the US and Canada have shown reluctance, citing economic concerns. 

END OF SUMMARY.
