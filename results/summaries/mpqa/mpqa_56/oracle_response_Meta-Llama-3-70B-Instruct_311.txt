SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment to international conventions and its willingness to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support Jordan's environmental efforts. In contrast, the US administration opposed the protocol in 2001, citing concerns over economic interests. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance to sign the agreement, fearing economic damage. However, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol sends a positive signal, emphasizing the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. By doing so, Jordan is taking a step in the right direction, while other countries continue to prioritize economic interests over environmental concerns.

END OF SUMMARY.
