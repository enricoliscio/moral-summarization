SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates Jordan's commitment to international environmental conventions and its willingness to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support Jordan's environmental initiatives. In contrast, developed countries like the US and Canada have shown reluctance to sign the protocol, citing economic concerns. The US has even produced its own alternative climate change strategy, which has been criticized by European Union countries. The European Union, on the other hand, has reaffirmed its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, with its 15 member states agreeing to be formally bound to the accord. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a morally commendable step, as it prioritizes the well-being of the planet and future generations over short-term economic gains.

END OF SUMMARY.
