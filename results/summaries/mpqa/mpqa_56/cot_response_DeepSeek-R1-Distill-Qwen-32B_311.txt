Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The main points are: Jordan is signing the Kyoto Protocol, which is a UN agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. They mention the director general of GCEP, Faris Juneidi, who spoke about the upcoming signing. The protocol was established in 1997, obliging developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. Jordan is doing this to show their commitment to international conventions and hopes to attract funding. Other countries like the EU have agreed to be bound by the protocol, while the US opposed it, citing economic interests. Canada was also reluctant, fearing economic damage.

Now, for step one, I need to identify all the morally framed single words. Looking through the article, words like "commitment," "obliged," "opposed," "slammed," "economic interests," "alternative," "reluctance," and "economic damage" stand out as they carry moral connotations.

For the summary, I should include these words to preserve the moral framing. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Jordan's decision to sign, mention the commitment, the EU's agreement, the US opposition, and Canada's reluctance. I'll also note the reasons each country gave, using the morally framed words.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it to highlight Jordan's action, the context of the protocol, other countries' reactions, and the reasons behind their decisions, all while using the identified moral terms.

**STEP 1:**  
* Commitment  
* Obliged  
* Opposed  
* Slammed  
* Economic interests  
* Alternative  
* Reluctance  
* Economic damage  

**SUMMARY:**  
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its "commitment towards different international conventions." The protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. Jordan hopes the move will attract funding for global climate efforts. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to be formally bound by the protocol by June 1, while the US opposed it, citing economic interests, and developed its own alternative strategy. Canada has also shown reluctance, fearing economic damage. END OF SUMMARY.
