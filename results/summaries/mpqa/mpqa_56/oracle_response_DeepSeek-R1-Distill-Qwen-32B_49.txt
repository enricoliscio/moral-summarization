Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The author used words like "reducing" and "opposed." I should make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Jordan is signing the Kyoto Protocol, which is a UN agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. They're doing this to show their commitment to international conventions and to attract funding. The article also mentions that the US opposed the protocol, saying it goes against their economic interests, and other countries like Canada were reluctant because of economic impacts.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Jordan's decision to sign the protocol, mention the director general's comment about Prince Zeid signing it soon. Then, I'll explain the protocol's goal of reducing emissions and the US opposition. Finally, I'll note Jordan's commitment and the EU's recent ratification.

I should use the words "reducing" and "opposed" as per the author's framing. Also, I need to keep the summary in the specified format with the tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its commitment to international environmental conventions. The protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed nations are the primary sources of large-scale pollution, Jordan's move highlights its dedication to global environmental efforts and hopes to attract funding for climate change initiatives. The signing will be carried out by Prince Zeid Ben Raad, Jordan's representative to the UN. Meanwhile, the US opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests, and instead pursued its own strategy to reduce emissions. Other countries, like Canada, have also shown reluctance due to potential economic impacts. Jordan's decision underscores its proactive stance on environmental issues, aligning with recent EU ratification efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
