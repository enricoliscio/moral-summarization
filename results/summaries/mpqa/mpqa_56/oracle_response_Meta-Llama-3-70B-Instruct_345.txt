SUMMARY:
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision. The country's commitment to the protocol is seen as a way to stress its dedication to international conventions. By signing the protocol, Jordan hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere and cause climate change. This move is in contrast to the US administration, which opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, fearing economic damage. The European Union, on the other hand, has agreed to be formally bound to the accord. Jordan's decision is a step towards reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change.
