SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment to international environmental conventions, despite not being a major contributor to air pollution. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases and mitigating climate change. This decision is in stark contrast to that of the US, which opposed the protocol in 2001 citing economic interests, and other developed countries like Canada, which have shown reluctance due to concerns over economic damage. The European Union, on the other hand, has agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a morally commendable step, showcasing its responsibility towards the global community and the environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
