SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions. Despite not being a developed country, Jordan is taking a stand by opposing large-scale air pollution and demonstrating its commitment to international environmental conventions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that Jordan aims to attract more funding to support global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which are the main cause of climate change.

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, legally binds developed nations to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 8% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While the US opposed the protocol, citing economic interests, Jordan's decision reflects its dedication to environmental responsibilities. The US instead proposed its climate change strategy, encouraging industries to cut emissions voluntarily. Canada has also expressed reluctance toward the protocol due to potential economic impacts. Conversely, the 15 European Union members unanimously agreed to be bound by the Kyoto accord, setting a ratification deadline of June 1, 2002. Jordan's move emphasizes its commitment to environmental stewardship and international cooperation in mitigating climate change. 

END OF SUMMARY.
