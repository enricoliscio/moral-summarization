Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include the words "reducing" and "opposed." Let me read through the article again to make sure I capture the key points.

The article is about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. It mentions that Jordan's decision is to show commitment to international conventions and attract funding. I should highlight that Jordan is taking a proactive stance, which is a positive moral action.

The article also contrasts this with the US and Canada, who opposed the protocol. The US opposed it because they thought it hurt their economic interests, while Canada was worried about GDP and economic damage. These are negative moral actions, so I should make sure to include "opposed" when talking about them.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me outline the main points: Jordan's decision, the purpose of the protocol, the EU's agreement, and the opposition from the US and Canada. I should structure it so each point flows logically, using the morally framed words appropriately.

I'll start by stating Jordan's decision and their commitment. Then mention the EU's agreement. Next, contrast with the US and Canada's opposition, explaining their reasons. Finally, conclude with Jordan's positive move despite challenges.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure to include "reducing" when talking about the protocol's goal and "opposed" when referring to the US and Canada. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Keep it concise but informative, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its commitment to international environmental conventions. The protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. Jordan’s move is intended to attract funding for global climate efforts and demonstrate its dedication to environmental protection. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to formally ratify the protocol by June 1, while the US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests, and Canada has also shown reluctance due to concerns over economic impact. Jordan’s decision highlights its proactive stance on climate action despite challenges faced by some developed nations in supporting the protocol.  
END OF SUMMARY.
