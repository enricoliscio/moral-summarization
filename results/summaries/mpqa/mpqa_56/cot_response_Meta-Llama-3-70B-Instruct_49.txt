SUMMARY:
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its commitment towards international environmental conventions. The country's General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which cause climate change. This move is in stark contrast to the US administration's opposition to the protocol in 2001, which was slammed by European Union countries at the time. Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, citing potential economic damage. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a positive step towards addressing the critical issue of climate change. The country's representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, will soon sign the agreement, marking a significant milestone in the global fight against climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
