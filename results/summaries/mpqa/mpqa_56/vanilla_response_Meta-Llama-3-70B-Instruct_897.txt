SUMMARY:

Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The country's representative to the UN, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, will sign the protocol on a yet-to-be-determined date. The move is seen as a commitment to international environmental conventions and is expected to attract more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the main source of air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is seen as a positive step. The EU has already agreed to be formally bound to the accord, while the US has opposed it, citing economic interests. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance towards signing the protocol.

END OF SUMMARY.
