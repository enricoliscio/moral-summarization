SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The signing is expected to take place soon, with Jordan's representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, set to sign the protocol. Although developed countries are the main source of air pollution, Jordan's decision is seen as a commitment to international conventions. The signing is also hoped to attract more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. The Kyoto Protocol legally obliges developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The move comes as 15 European Union member states have agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord, while the US and Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the protocol, citing economic concerns.
