Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Jordan deciding to sign the Kyoto Protocol. It mentions that Jordan's director general, Faris Juneidi, announced this decision after a Cabinet meeting. They plan to have Prince Zeid Ben Raad sign it, but the exact date isn't set yet.

I should note that the Kyoto Protocol is a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly targeting developed countries to cut emissions by 8% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan is a developing country, so their decision is more about commitment to international conventions rather than being a major emitter.

The article also mentions that the EU countries agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002. In contrast, the US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests, and Canada was reluctant because they thought it would harm their GDP. This shows a moral contrast between countries supporting the environment versus those prioritizing economic growth.

I need to highlight Jordan's commitment and the moral stance of supporting global efforts despite not being a major polluter. Also, contrast this with the US and Canada's decisions, emphasizing the moral choice between environmental responsibility and economic concerns.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it includes all key points: Jordan's decision, the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol, the EU's support, and the US and Canada's opposition with their reasons. The moral framing is about countries choosing to support environmental efforts versus economic interests.

Let me structure it: Start with Jordan's decision, mention the protocol's goals, then note the EU's support, and contrast with the US and Canada's reluctance. Emphasize the moral commitment Jordan is showing.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence flows logically to convey the moral aspect clearly.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision. The protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While Jordan, as a developing country, is not a major source of pollution, its decision reflects a commitment to international environmental conventions. The General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) hopes the move will attract funding to support global efforts against climate change. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. Jordan's decision highlights its moral commitment to addressing climate change despite its limited role as a polluter.  
END OF SUMMARY.
