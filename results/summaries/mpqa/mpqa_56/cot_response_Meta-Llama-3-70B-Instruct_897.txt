SUMMARY:
Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its "commitment towards the different international conventions." The country's move is seen as a positive step towards combating climate change, which is caused by the trapping of heat in the earth's atmosphere. In contrast, the US administration had opposed the protocol in 2001, citing that it contravenes US economic interests, a decision that was "slammed" by European Union countries at the time. Other developed countries like Canada have shown "reluctance" towards signing the protocol, fearing economic damage. Jordan's decision is expected to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases. The signing of the protocol is a significant step towards a global effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
