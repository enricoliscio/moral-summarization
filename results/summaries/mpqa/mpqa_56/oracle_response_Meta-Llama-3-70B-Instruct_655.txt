SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The country's commitment to this international convention is a step towards reducing its environmental footprint. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere and cause climate change. This move is in stark contrast to the US administration's opposition to the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, fearing economic damage. However, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol demonstrates its commitment to environmental protection and reducing its impact on the environment. By doing so, Jordan is setting an example for other countries to follow suit and take responsibility for their environmental actions.
