Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article mentions that Jordan is going to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which is a UN agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. The director of GCEP, Faris Juneidi, says they'll sign it soon but haven't set a date yet. Jordan's decision is highlighted as a commitment to international conventions, even though they're not a major polluter. They hope this will attract more funding for environmental efforts.

The article also contrasts this with the US and Canada, which opposed the protocol because they thought it would harm their economies. Europe, on the other hand, agreed to be bound by it by June 1, 2001.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Jordan's decision, the reason behind it (commitment to conventions), the hope for funding, and the contrast with the US and Canada's stance. I should also mention that the Kyoto Protocol requires developed countries to reduce emissions, even though Jordan isn't a major polluter.

I should structure the summary to first state Jordan's decision, then explain their reasons, and then contrast with other countries' actions. I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it: Start with Jordan's decision to sign, mention the director, the commitment, the funding goal. Then mention the US and Canada's opposition and Europe's support. Keep each point concise.

I think that covers all the necessary parts while maintaining the moral framing about international responsibility and economic vs environmental priorities.

SUMMARY: Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its commitment to international environmental conventions. The decision, made by the Jordanian Cabinet, will be carried out by Prince Zeid Ben Raad, Jordan's representative to the UN, though no exact signing date has been set. The Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997, legally binds developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed nations are the primary sources of large-scale pollution, Jordan's move underscores its dedication to global environmental efforts and aims to attract funding for climate change initiatives. In contrast, the US and Canada have opposed the protocol, citing economic concerns, while the EU has committed to ratifying it by June 1, 2001. END OF SUMMARY.
