SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a significant step towards demonstrating its commitment to international environmental conventions and efforts to impede global greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), revealed that the government will delegate Jordan's representative to the UN, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol. This move emphasizes Jordan's dedication to reducing greenhouse gases, which are the primary contributors to climate change.

The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally binds developed nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While these nations are the major sources of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol sends a strong message of its environmental commitment. By signing the protocol, Jordan also hopes to attract additional funding to support international efforts in mitigating climate change.

It is worth noting that the US administration opposed the protocol in 2001, citing contravention of US economic interests, and instead proposed its climate change strategy. Other nations, like Canada, have expressed reluctance due to potential economic impacts. However, the 15 European Union member states have agreed to be bound by the Kyoto accord, demonstrating their commitment to tackling this global issue. END OF SUMMARY.
