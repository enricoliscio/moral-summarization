Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article mentions that Jordan is signing the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They mention that the decision was made by the Cabinet, and the director general of GCEP, Faris Juneidi, is speaking about it. The protocol was established in 1997, obliging developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

The article notes that while developed countries are the main polluters, Jordan is signing to show their commitment to international conventions. They hope this will attract more funding for environmental efforts. GCEP is the main environmental agency in Jordan.

It also mentions that the EU countries agreed to be bound by the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, 2002. The US opposed it in 2001, saying it hurt their economic interests, and instead created their own strategy. Canada was reluctant too, fearing economic damage.

So, the moral framing here is about Jordan taking responsibility despite being a developing country, showing commitment to global agreements. The US and Canada's reluctance highlights the tension between economic interests and environmental responsibility.

I need to make sure the summary includes Jordan's action, the context of the protocol, their reasons, and the contrast with the US and Canada. I should keep it under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

Let me structure it: mention Jordan's decision, the protocol's goal, Jordan's reasons (commitment, funding), GCEP's role, EU's move, US and Canada's opposition with reasons. Keep it concise but cover all key points.

I think that's all. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY: Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its commitment to international environmental conventions. The protocol, established in 1997, requires developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. While developed nations are the primary contributors to pollution, Jordan's move underscores its dedication to global environmental efforts and hopes to attract funding for climate initiatives. The General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) will oversee Jordan's participation. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to fully ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
