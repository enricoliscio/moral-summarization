SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection, stated that the move demonstrates Jordan's commitment to international environmental conventions and its efforts to attract funding for climate change initiatives. The protocol, agreed upon in 1997, mandates developed countries to reduce emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed nations are the primary contributors to air pollution, Jordan's signature emphasizes its dedication to environmental causes. Juneidi hopes that signing the protocol will bring additional funding to support international efforts in reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. The EU member states have also agreed to be bound by the accord, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. Jordan's decision underscores its environmental stewardship and willingness to collaborate on global climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
