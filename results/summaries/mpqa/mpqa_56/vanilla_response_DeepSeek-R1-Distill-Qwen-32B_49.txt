Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, I see that Jordan's director general, Faris Juneidi, announced that Jordan will sign the Kyoto Protocol. The signing will be done by Prince Zeid Ben Raad, but the exact date isn't set yet. The Kyoto Protocol is a UN agreement from 1997 that requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

Jordan is doing this to show their commitment to international conventions, even though they're not a major polluter. The goal is to attract more funding for environmental efforts. The General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) is the main agency handling this.

I also notice that the EU countries agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002, while the US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests. Canada was also reluctant, fearing economic losses.

So, the key points are: Jordan signing Kyoto, the purpose, the agency involved, the EU's action, and the US and Canada's stance. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include all important details without being too wordy.

I should structure it by first stating Jordan's decision, then the reason, mention GCEP, the EU's move, and the US and Canada's opposition. Keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision. The signing will be carried out by Jordan's representative to the UN, Prince Zeid Ben Raad, though no exact date has been set. The Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed nations are the primary sources of pollution, Jordan's decision reflects its commitment to international environmental conventions. The General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) hopes the move will attract funding for global efforts to combat climate change. Meanwhile, the 15 EU member states have agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002. In contrast, the US opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests, while Canada also expressed reluctance, fearing economic losses.  
END OF SUMMARY.
