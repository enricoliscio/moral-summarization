SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite being a developing country that is not legally bound by the agreement. This decision showcases Jordan's commitment to international environmental efforts and its willingness to take moral responsibility for global climate change, even though developed countries are the main contributors to air pollution. The move also aims to attract funding to support global initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate change.

Jordan's decision stands in contrast to countries like the US and Canada, who have opposed the protocol due to perceived economic disadvantages, prioritizing economic interests over global environmental responsibilities. On the other hand, the 15 European Union member states have demonstrated their commitment to the cause by agreeing to be bound by the Kyoto accord. Jordan's proactive approach highlights its dedication to environmental stewardship and its willingness to be part of the global solution, despite not being legally required to do so. END OF SUMMARY.
