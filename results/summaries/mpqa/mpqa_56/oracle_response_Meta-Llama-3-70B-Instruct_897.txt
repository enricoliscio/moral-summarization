SUMMARY:

Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its commitment to international environmental conventions. The signing is expected to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which cause climate change. This move is in contrast to the US administration, which opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests. The US instead produced its own alternative climate change strategy, encouraging industries to trim their emissions. Other developed countries, like Canada, have also shown reluctance towards signing the protocol, fearing it would cut their national GDP and cause economic damage. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a step towards reducing air pollution, which is largely caused by developed countries. The exact date for signing has not been set, but it is expected to take place soon.
