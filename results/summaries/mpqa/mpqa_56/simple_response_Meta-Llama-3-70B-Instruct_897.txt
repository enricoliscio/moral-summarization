SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment to international environmental conventions, despite not being a major contributor to air pollution. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which cause climate change. In contrast, developed countries such as the US and Canada have shown reluctance to sign the protocol, citing economic concerns. The US has instead produced its own alternative climate change strategy, while Canada has expressed fears that the protocol would harm its economy. Jordan's decision is a step in the right direction, highlighting the importance of collective action to address the pressing issue of climate change. By taking this moral stance, Jordan sets an example for other countries to follow suit and prioritize the health of the planet over economic interests.
