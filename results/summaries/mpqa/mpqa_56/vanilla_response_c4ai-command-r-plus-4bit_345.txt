SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that the move demonstrates Jordan's commitment to international environmental conventions and its efforts to attract funding for global climate change initiatives. The protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally binds developed nations to decrease emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the primary contributors to air pollution, Jordan's signature emphasizes its dedication to environmental causes. The GCEP hopes that signing the protocol will result in increased funding to combat greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. The European Union has also shown support for the protocol, with its members agreeing to be bound by the accord. However, the US and Canada have opposed the protocol, citing economic concerns. Jordan's decision underscores its commitment to environmental sustainability and international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
