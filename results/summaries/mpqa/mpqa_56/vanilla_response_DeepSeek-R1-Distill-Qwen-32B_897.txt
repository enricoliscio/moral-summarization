Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Jordan will sign the Kyoto Protocol, as decided by their Cabinet. Faris Juneidi from GCEP mentioned that Prince Zeid Ben Raad will sign it, but the exact date isn't set yet. The Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997, requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

Jordan's decision is to show their commitment to international conventions, even though they're not a major polluter. They hope this will attract funding for environmental efforts. GCEP is the agency handling this under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment.

The EU members agreed to be bound by the protocol by June 1, 2002. The US opposed it in 2001, saying it hurt their economy, and instead created their own strategy. Canada was also reluctant, fearing economic losses.

So, the key points are: Jordan signing the protocol, their reason for doing so, the EU's support, and the US and Canada's opposition. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

I should make sure to include Jordan's action, the protocol's requirements, the reasons behind Jordan's decision, the EU's agreement, and the opposition from the US and Canada. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Jordan's decision, then the protocol details, followed by the implications and other countries' actions.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid extra details and focus on the main facts. Also, I should check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft it now, making sure each sentence covers one main point without unnecessary information.

The signing will be conducted by Prince Zeid Ben Raad, though the exact date remains to be determined. The protocol, established in 1997, requires developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. Jordan's move underscores its commitment to international environmental conventions, despite being a minor contributor to pollution. The government hopes the move will attract funding for global climate efforts. Meanwhile, the 15 EU member states have agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
