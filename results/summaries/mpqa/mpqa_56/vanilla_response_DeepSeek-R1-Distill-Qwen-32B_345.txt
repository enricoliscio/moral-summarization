Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through it carefully.

The article mentions that Jordan's director general, Faris Juneidi, announced they'll sign the protocol soon. They'll delegate Prince Zeid Ben Raad to sign it, but the exact date isn't set yet. The Kyoto Protocol, from 1997, requires developed countries to reduce greenhouse gases by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan is doing this to show their commitment to international conventions and hopes to get more funding for environmental efforts. The GCEP, under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, is handling this. 

Other points include the EU member states agreeing to be bound by the Kyoto accord by June 1, 2002. The US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests, and Canada was reluctant too, fearing economic damage. 

I should include all these key points concisely. Make sure to mention Jordan's decision, the protocol's goal, the EU's move, and the US and Canada's stances. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that Jordan's representative to the United Nations, Prince Zeid Ben Raad, will soon sign the protocol, though the exact date has not been finalized. The Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan's decision underscores its commitment to international environmental conventions and aims to attract funding for global efforts to combat climate change. The GCEP, under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, is responsible for managing Jordan's environmental agreements. Meanwhile, the 15 European Union member states have agreed to formally ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, 2002. In contrast, the United States opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests, while Canada expressed reluctance, fearing economic repercussions. END OF SUMMARY.
