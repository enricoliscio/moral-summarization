SUMMARY: Jordan is set to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions, according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP). This decision highlights Jordan's commitment to international environmental conventions and its willingness to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which are the main drivers of climate change. While developed countries are the major contributors to large-scale air pollution, Jordan's signature on the protocol is a significant step towards ensuring global participation in addressing this issue. The protocol legally binds developed nations to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012, yet the US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests. Other countries, like Canada, have also expressed reluctance, believing that the protocol would harm their economies. In contrast, the 15 European Union member states have unanimously agreed to be bound by the protocol, showcasing their dedication to environmental protection. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a positive step towards global environmental cooperation and a demonstration of its dedication to reducing climate change impacts.
