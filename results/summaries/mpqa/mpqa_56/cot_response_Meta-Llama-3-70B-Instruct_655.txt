SUMMARY:
Jordan has made a commendable decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment towards international conventions and its willingness to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support environmental initiatives. In contrast, the US administration had opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests, a decision that was slammed by European Union countries. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance towards signing the protocol, fearing economic damage. Jordan's decision is a positive step towards addressing the pressing issue of climate change, and it is hoped that other countries will follow suit. END OF SUMMARY.
