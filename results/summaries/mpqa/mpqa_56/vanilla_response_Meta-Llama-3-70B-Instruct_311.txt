SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The signing is expected to take place soon, with Prince Zeid Ben Raad, Jordan's representative to the UN, delegated to sign the protocol. The move is seen as a commitment to international environmental conventions and is hoped to attract more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the main source of air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is seen as a positive step. The news comes as the 15 European Union member states have agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord, while the US and Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the protocol, citing economic concerns.
