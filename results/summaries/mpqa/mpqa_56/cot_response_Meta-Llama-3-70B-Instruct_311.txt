SUMMARY:
Jordan has taken a commendable step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions by deciding to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at impeding global climate change. This decision demonstrates Jordan's commitment towards international conventions and its willingness to contribute to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The protocol, which was signed by 15 European Union member states, legally obliges developed countries to reduce their emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. In contrast, the US administration opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests, a decision that was slammed by European Union countries. Instead, the US government produced its own alternative climate change strategy, which aims to encourage industries to trim their emissions. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support its environmental efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
