SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The move is seen as a commitment to international environmental conventions and a step towards attracting more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases. The protocol, which was agreed upon in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the main source of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a moral imperative, recognizing the country's responsibility to contribute to global efforts in mitigating climate change. The decision is in stark contrast to that of the US, which opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests. Jordan's move is a step in the right direction, demonstrating its commitment to environmental protection and setting an example for other countries to follow.
