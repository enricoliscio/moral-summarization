SUMMARY:
Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move underscores Jordan's *commitment* to international conventions and its willingness to contribute to global efforts in mitigating climate change. Despite the *opposition* of some developed countries, such as the US, which has *slammed* the protocol for contravening its economic interests, Jordan is taking a proactive approach. The US has instead opted for an alternative strategy, encouraging industries to voluntarily reduce emissions. Other countries like Canada have expressed *reluctance* towards the protocol due to perceived economic impacts. However, with the EU's recent agreement to be bound by the protocol, Jordan is joining a growing number of nations recognizing the importance of addressing climate change. By signing the protocol, Jordan aims to attract additional funding to support these efforts and showcase its dedication to environmental sustainability and global cooperation.
