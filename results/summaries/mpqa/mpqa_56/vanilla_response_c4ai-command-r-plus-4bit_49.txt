SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that the country's representative to the UN, Prince Zeid Ben Raad, will be delegated to sign the protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally binds developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol demonstrates its commitment to international environmental conventions and its efforts to attract funding for reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. The GCEP, operating under the relevant ministry, is Jordan's point of reference for environmental pacts. The EU member states have also agreed to be bound by the Kyoto accord, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. Jordan's signing of the protocol emphasizes its dedication to environmental sustainability and international cooperation.
END OF SUMMARY.
