SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a significant step towards demonstrating its commitment to international efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), affirmed the country's decision to join the environmental agreement. While developed countries are the primary contributors to large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol underscores its dedication to global environmental initiatives. Unfortunately, the US administration opposed the protocol in 2001, citing a conflict with US economic interests. Instead, they proposed an alternative strategy, encouraging industries to voluntarily curb emissions. Other countries, like Canada, have expressed reluctance, citing potential economic impacts. The Jordan Times reports that Jordan's decision aims to showcase its dedication to international environmental conventions and attract funding to support global efforts in combating climate change. This move by Jordan aligns with global efforts to address the pressing issue of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. END OF SUMMARY.
