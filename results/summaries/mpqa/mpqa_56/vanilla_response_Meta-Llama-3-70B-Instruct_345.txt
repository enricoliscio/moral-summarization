SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The signing is expected to take place soon, with Prince Zeid Ben Raad, Jordan's representative to the UN, delegated to sign the protocol. The move is seen as a commitment to international environmental conventions and is hoped to attract more funding to contribute to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, obliges developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the main source of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision is seen as a positive step. The EU member states have already agreed to be bound by the accord, while the US and Canada have shown reluctance, citing economic concerns.
