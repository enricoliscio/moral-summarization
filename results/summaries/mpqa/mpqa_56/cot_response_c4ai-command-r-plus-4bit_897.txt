SUMMARY:
Jordan has demonstrated its *commitment* to international environmental efforts by deciding to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This protocol legally *obliges* developed nations to decrease emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. Despite *opposition* from countries like the US, which cites economic concerns, and *reluctance* from others, such as Canada, Jordan's decision underscores its dedication to global environmental conventions. Faris Juneidi, director general of Jordan's environmental protection agency, hopes that signing the protocol will attract additional funding to support international initiatives in mitigating climate change. The country's move aligns with the recent agreement by 15 European Union members to be bound by the Kyoto accord. Jordan's decision emphasizes responsible global citizenship and a willingness to address the pressing issue of climate change.
