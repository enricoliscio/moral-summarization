SUMMARY:

Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment to international environmental conventions. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to contribute to the global effort of reducing greenhouse gases, which cause climate change. The Kyoto Protocol legally obliges developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. In contrast, the US administration opposed the protocol in 2001, citing economic interests. Other developed countries, such as Canada, have also shown reluctance to sign the protocol, fearing economic damage. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is a positive step towards mitigating climate change, and sets an example for other countries to follow.
