Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Jordan is going to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The decision was made by the Cabinet, and Faris Juneidi, the director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), is the source. He mentions that Prince Zeid Ben Raad will sign the protocol on behalf of Jordan, but the exact date isn't set yet.

Next, it explains what the Kyoto Protocol is. It's a 1997 agreement that legally binds developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan is a developing country, but they're signing to show their commitment to international conventions. Juneidi also says that signing the protocol will help attract more funding for environmental efforts.

The GCEP is under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment and is responsible for environmental pacts in Jordan. On the same day, the EU member states agreed to be formally bound by the Kyoto Protocol and complete ratification by June 1, 2001. Meanwhile, the US opposed the protocol in 2001, arguing it would harm their economy, and instead created their own strategy. Canada was also reluctant, fearing economic losses.

The moral framing here is about Jordan's proactive stance in environmental responsibility despite being a developing country. It contrasts with the US and Canada's reluctance, highlighting Jordan's commitment to global agreements and the potential economic benefits through funding.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral aspect. The summary should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to include Jordan's decision, the reasons behind it, the comparison with the US and Canada, and the implications of the EU's action.

I should structure it to first state Jordan's decision, then explain the Kyoto Protocol briefly, mention the reasons Jordan is signing, contrast with the US and Canada, and note the EU's move. Also, highlight the funding aspect and the moral commitment.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll need to be concise but cover all key points without exceeding 200 words. Make sure to include that Jordan is a developing country but still committed, the EU's ratification, and the US and Canada's reluctance for context.

SUMMARY: Jordan has decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its commitment to international environmental conventions. The protocol, established in 1997, legally obliges developed countries to cut emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan, a developing country, is taking this step to attract funding for environmental efforts and demonstrate its dedication to global climate initiatives. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to formally ratify the protocol by June 1, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. Jordan's move highlights its proactive stance on environmental responsibility, contrasting with the reluctance of some developed nations. END OF SUMMARY.
