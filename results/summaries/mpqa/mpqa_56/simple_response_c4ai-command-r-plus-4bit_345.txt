SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its commitment to international environmental efforts. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), said that by signing the protocol, Jordan aims to emphasize its dedication to global environmental conventions and attract funding to support initiatives addressing climate change. The protocol, agreed upon in 1997, mandates developed nations to decrease emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels. While developed countries are the primary contributors to air pollution, Jordan's decision underscores its moral responsibility and desire to play a proactive role in global environmental governance. Despite opposition from countries like the US and Canada, who prioritize economic interests over environmental concerns, Jordan's decision reflects its ethical stance on the global climate crisis. Juneidi expressed hopes that signing the protocol would attract funding to support international efforts in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. GCEP, the country's environmental reference agency, leads Jordan's efforts in upholding environmental agreements. The 15 European Union members have also shown solidarity by agreeing to be bound by the Kyoto accord. Jordan's decision exemplifies moral leadership and a commitment to environmental stewardship on the global stage. END OF SUMMARY.
