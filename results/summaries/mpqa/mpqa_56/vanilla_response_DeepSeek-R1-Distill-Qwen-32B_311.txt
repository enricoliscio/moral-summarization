Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jordan signing the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article starts by stating that Jordan will sign the Kyoto Protocol, as per a recent Cabinet decision. Faris Juneidi from the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) made the announcement. He mentioned that Prince Zeid Ben Raad will sign it on behalf of Jordan, but the exact date isn't set yet. 

The Kyoto Protocol was established in 1997, legally obliging developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Jordan's decision, despite being a developing country, shows their commitment to international conventions. They hope this move will attract more funding for environmental efforts.

GCEP is the main agency handling environmental pacts in Jordan. The EU countries have also agreed to be bound by the Kyoto Protocol, with ratification by June 1. The US opposed it in 2001, citing economic interests, and created their own strategy. Canada was reluctant too, fearing economic losses.

So, the key points are:
- Jordan is signing the Kyoto Protocol.
- GCEP is leading the effort.
- The protocol aims to reduce emissions from developed countries.
- Jordan's move is a commitment to international agreements.
- They hope to get more funding.
- EU countries are on board, while US and Canada are not.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Jordan's decision, the protocol's goals, the significance for Jordan, and the context of other countries' positions. I'll make sure to keep it concise and include all main points without getting too detailed.
