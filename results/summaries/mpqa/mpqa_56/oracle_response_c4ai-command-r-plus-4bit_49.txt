SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a significant step in opposing large-scale air pollution and demonstrating its commitment to international environmental conventions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), revealed that the country will soon delegate its representative to the UN, Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol. The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed nations to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012, compared to 1990 levels. Despite the US administration's opposition to the protocol in 2001 due to perceived contravention of US economic interests, Jordan's decision underscores its dedication to global environmental efforts. By signing the protocol, Jordan aims to attract additional funding to support international initiatives in reducing greenhouse gases and combating climate change. This move follows the EU member states' agreement to be formally bound by the Kyoto accord, with a ratification deadline set for June 1, 2002. Canada, however, has expressed reluctance, citing potential economic damage as a concern. Jordan's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol highlights its dedication to environmental stewardship and global cooperation in reducing the impacts of climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
