SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), stated that the move demonstrates Jordan's commitment to international environmental conventions and its intention to contribute to global efforts in mitigating climate change. The protocol, agreed upon in 1997, legally binds developed nations to decrease emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed countries are the primary contributors to air pollution, Jordan's signature underscores its dedication to environmental protection. The GCEP hopes that signing the protocol will attract additional funding to support international efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which are a major driver of climate change. The EU has also shown its support by agreeing to be bound by the accord, while the US and Canada have opposed it, citing economic concerns. Jordan's decision highlights its environmental leadership and commitment to global sustainability efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
