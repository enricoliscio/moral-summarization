SUMMARY:

Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This move demonstrates the country's commitment to international environmental conventions and its willingness to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. The signing of the protocol is expected to attract more funding to support Jordan's environmental initiatives. In contrast, developed countries like the US and Canada have shown reluctance to sign the protocol, citing concerns over economic interests and potential damage to their national GDP. The European Union, on the other hand, has agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord. Jordan's decision to sign the protocol sets a positive example for other countries to follow, highlighting the importance of prioritizing the environment and the well-being of future generations over short-term economic gains.

END OF SUMMARY.
