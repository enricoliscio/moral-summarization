SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN agreement aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating its commitment to international environmental efforts. Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), revealed that the country will soon delegate its representative to the UN, Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol. Despite not being a developed country, Jordan recognizes the importance of joining global efforts to mitigate climate change. The protocol legally binds developed nations to decrease emissions by 8% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Juneidi asserts that Jordan's signature signifies its dedication to international conventions and hopes to attract funding to support global initiatives. The GCEP aims to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases, which are responsible for trapping heat and causing climate change. The US and other developed countries have opposed the protocol due to perceived economic drawbacks, but Jordan's decision underscores its moral responsibility and commitment to environmental protection. Jordan stands with the international community in prioritizing the planet's well-being over short-term economic gains. END OF SUMMARY.
