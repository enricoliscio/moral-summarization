SUMMARY:
Jordan has announced its decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a significant step towards demonstrating its commitment to international environmental conventions. This protocol legally obliges developed nations to curb their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012, compared to 1990 levels. Despite opposition from some countries, particularly the US, which cited economic interests, and reluctance from others, Jordan's move underscores its dedication to global environmental efforts. By signing the protocol, Jordan's General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP) aims to attract additional funding to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases, which are the primary culprit behind climate change. The GCEP hopes that this commitment will result in much-needed funding to support international efforts. Meanwhile, the 15 European Union member states have also agreed to be bound by the Kyoto accord, providing further momentum to the global fight against climate change. This united front by the EU stands in stark contrast to the US administration's opposition to the protocol, which instead favors an alternative strategy that encourages industries to voluntarily reduce emissions. Canada has also expressed reluctance to sign the protocol due to concerns about potential economic damage. Jordan's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol is a bold statement of its commitment to environmental stewardship and international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
