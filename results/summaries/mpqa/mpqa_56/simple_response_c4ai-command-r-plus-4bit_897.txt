SUMMARY: Jordan has announced its intention to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international agreement aimed at curbing global greenhouse gas emissions. This decision underscores Jordan's commitment to environmental stewardship and international cooperation. By signing the protocol, Jordan joins other responsible nations in recognizing the importance of tackling climate change.

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, mandates that developed countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. While developed nations bear the brunt of responsibility for historical emissions, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol highlights its dedication to global environmental efforts.

Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP), emphasized that Jordan's signature aims to demonstrate its commitment to international conventions and attract funding to support global initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases. The GCEP is optimistic that this move will result in increased funding to combat climate change, a moral imperative for all nations.

Jordan's decision comes as the 15 European Union member states also agree to be bound by the protocol, setting a positive example for the international community. However, some countries, such as the United States and Canada, have opposed the protocol due to perceived economic impacts, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term environmental sustainability and global welfare.
