SUMMARY:

Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and one Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Onufrienko, have settled into the International Space Station (ISS) for a six-month stay. They arrived on Saturday aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, replacing the previous crew who had been on board since August. The new crew installed their lifeboat seat liners and stowed away their space suits before taking over the station. Onufrienko will serve as commander until May. The crew also transferred cargo from the shuttle to the station, including a Italian-built carrier named Raffaello, which is loaded with three tons of supplies. The astronauts also brought personal items, such as fishing gear, weaving material, and a keyboard, to the station. The previous crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth in a week, after spending 128 days in space.
