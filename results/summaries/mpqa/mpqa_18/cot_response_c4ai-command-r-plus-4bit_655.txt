SUMMARY: 
Three astronauts, two Americans and one Russian, have *settled* into the International Space Station for a six-month *stay*. After arriving aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, they had to wait to trade places with the current space station crew. Once their gear and personal items were moved over, the new crew could officially call the space station home. The new commander, Russian Yuri Onufrienko, was eager to take command, *peeking* through a window before the hatch opened. Onufrienko, along with astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, brought items reflecting their *hobbies* and *support* devices, such as fly-tying materials and a keyboard. The current crew will return to Earth after 128 days in space, while the new crew will remain on the station until May. In addition to personal items, Endeavour also delivered an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies and experiments, further *supporting* the crew's mission.
END OF SUMMARY.
