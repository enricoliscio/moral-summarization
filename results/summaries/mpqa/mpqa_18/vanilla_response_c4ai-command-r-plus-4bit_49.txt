SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut arrived at the International Space Station aboard the space shuttle Endeavour and began their six-month stay. The new crew members, Yuri Onufrienko, Daniel Bursch, and Carl Walz, brought with them personal items reflecting their hobbies, including materials for tying flies and weaving baskets. They also transferred an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies and equipment, from Endeavour to the space station. The current space station crew, Frank Culbertson, Mikhail Tyurin, and Vladimir Dezhurov, will return to Earth after spending 128 days in space. The new residents quickly settled in, with Onufrienko taking over as commander and looking forward to his extended stay on the station. END OF SUMMARY.
