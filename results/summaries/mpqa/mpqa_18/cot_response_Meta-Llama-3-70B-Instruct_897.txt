STEP 1:
* support
* home

SUMMARY:
A new crew of three men, including American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. As they begin their long-term residency, they bring with them personal items that reflect their hobbies and provide psychological support. Onufrienko, a fisherman, has material to tie flies, while Bursch has weaving material to make small baskets. Walz, on the other hand, has a five-octave keyboard that he calls a "psychological support device." As they make the space station their new home, they will remain on board until May, conducting science experiments and enjoying the comforts of their new surroundings. Meanwhile, the outgoing crew, led by American Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth in another week, marking the end of their 128-day journey in space. END OF SUMMARY.
