SUMMARY:

Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko have settled into the International Space Station (ISS) for a six-month stay. They arrived on Saturday aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, which docked with the ISS the day before. The new crew members replaced American Frank Culbertson, who will return to Earth with his Russian crew mates in a week, after spending 128 days in space. Before taking over, the new crew had to install their lifeboat seat liners and stow their space suits. Onufrienko, who will serve as ISS commander, was eager to take over and was seen peeking through a window before the hatch opened. The crew also transferred a cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with three tons of supplies, and brought personal items, including fishing gear, weaving material, and a keyboard. They will remain on the ISS until May.
