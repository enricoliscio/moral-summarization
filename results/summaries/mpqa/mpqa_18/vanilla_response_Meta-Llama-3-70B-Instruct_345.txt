SUMMARY:

Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko have settled into the International Space Station (ISS) for a six-month stay. They arrived on the space shuttle Endeavour and replaced the previous crew, who had been on board since August. The new crew installed their personal items, including Onufrienko's fly-tying materials, Bursch's weaving materials, and Walz's keyboard. They also transferred cargo from the shuttle to the ISS, including a Italian-built cargo carrier named Raffaello, which is loaded with food, clothes, and spare parts. The previous crew, led by American Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth in a week, after spending 128 days in space. Onufrienko will take over as ISS commander until May. The new crew is now settled in and ready to begin their long-term stay on the ISS.
