STEP 1:
* patience (implied in "couldn't wait")
* support (in "psychological support device")
* personal (in "personal items")

SUMMARY:
A new crew of three men, including Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko and American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. After arriving on space shuttle Endeavour, they took the time to install their lifeboat seat liners and stow away their space suits before calling the station home. Onufrienko, who will take over as commander, showed patience as he waited for the hatch to open. The crew brought personal items, including Onufrienko's fly-tying material, Bursch's weaving supplies, and Walz's five-octave keyboard, which he considers a psychological support device. As they settle in, they will unpack three tons of cargo, including food, clothes, and science experiments, and prepare for their long stay. END OF SUMMARY.
