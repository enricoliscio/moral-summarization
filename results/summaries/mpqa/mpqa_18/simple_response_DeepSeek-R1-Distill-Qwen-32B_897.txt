Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the new crew settling into the International Space Station. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that two Americans and one Russian cosmonaut arrived at the ISS. They're there for six months. The shuttle Endeavour brought them, but they didn't immediately swap with the existing crew because they had to move gear. The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, who's excited to take command. They installed their seat liners and space suits. The shuttle also delivered a cargo carrier with supplies. The outgoing crew has been there since August and will return soon. The new astronauts have personal items reflecting their hobbies, like fishing gear and a keyboard.

Now, the moral framing. The article highlights cooperation between nations, the peaceful use of space, and the dedication of the astronauts. It also touches on the personal touches, showing their humanity despite being in space. I should make sure the summary includes these elements to maintain the original's tone.

I'll start by mentioning the arrival of the new crew, their mission duration, the shuttle involved, and the handover process. Then, I'll note the installation of gear and the transfer of the cargo carrier. I'll also include the personal items to show their individuality and the outgoing crew's time in space. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure all key points are covered succinctly while preserving the positive and collaborative tone.

SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut have joined the International Space Station for a six-month mission, arriving aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The new crew, including Russian commander Yuri Onufrienko, American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, took over from the outgoing crew, which has been on board since August. The transition involved installing seat liners and space suits before they could officially occupy the station. Endeavour's crew also transferred a cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies, and will return it home filled with trash and used equipment. The new residents brought personal items reflecting their hobbies, such as fly-tying materials and a keyboard for psychological support. The outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space, marking a successful handover and continuation of humanity's presence in space. END OF SUMMARY.
