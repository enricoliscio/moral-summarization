Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the new crew settling into the International Space Station. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut arrived at the ISS on Saturday. They're there for a six-month stay. They came aboard the space shuttle Endeavour the day before, but didn't have time to swap with the existing crew right away because they had to set up their lifeboat seats and store their space suits.

The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, who's taking over as commander. He was eager to get into the station, peeking through the window before the hatch opened. The other astronauts are Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, who will stay until May.

They also moved some gear, using the shuttle's robot arm to attach an Italian cargo carrier named Raffaello, which has three tons of supplies. Once unloaded, it'll be filled with trash and returned on Endeavour.

The new crew brought personal items reflecting their hobbies: Onufrienko has fly-tying materials, Bursch has weaving stuff for baskets, and Walz has a keyboard for psychological support.

The outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, has been on the station since August and will return in a week after 128 days in space.

So, the main points are: new crew arrival, their mission duration, the process of settling in, the transfer of the cargo carrier, their personal items, and the outgoing crew's time in space.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the arrival, mention the three crew members, their mission duration, the process of setting up, the cargo transfer, their personal items, and the outgoing crew's time. I should keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary details.

Let me structure it: new crew arrives, their names, mission duration, setup process, cargo transfer, personal items, outgoing crew's time. That should cover all key points concisely.

SUMMARY:  
Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday for a six-month mission. They joined the station after the space shuttle Endeavour docked, and their arrival required setting up lifeboat seats and storing space suits. Onufrienko, a seasoned fisherman, eagerly took over as commander, while Bursch and Walz brought personal items reflecting their hobbies, including weaving materials and a keyboard for psychological support. The crew also transferred a cargo carrier named Raffaello, loaded with three tons of supplies, which will later return with trash and used equipment. The outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, has spent 128 days in space and will return in a week. END OF SUMMARY.
