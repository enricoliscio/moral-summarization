SUMMARY:
A new crew of three men, consisting of two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and one Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Onufrienko, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. As they trade places with the previous crew, they bring with them personal items that reflect their hobbies and provide a sense of comfort and support. Onufrienko, a fisherman, has brought material to tie flies, while Bursch has weaving material to make small baskets, and Walz has a five-octave keyboard that he calls a "psychological support device." As they make the space station their home, they will remain on board until May, conducting science experiments and maintaining the station. Meanwhile, the previous crew, led by American Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space. END OF SUMMARY.
