SUMMARY:

In a remarkable display of international cooperation and dedication to scientific progress, a new crew of three astronauts has taken up residence at the International Space Station. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, will spend the next six months on board, conducting experiments and maintaining the station. As they settled in, they brought with them personal items that reflect their individuality and humanity - Onufrienko's fly-tying materials, Bursch's weaving supplies, and Walz's keyboard, a "psychological support device". This milestone marks a significant step forward in the pursuit of advancing our understanding of space and its potential for humanity. The outgoing crew, led by American Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space, leaving behind a legacy of discovery and collaboration.
