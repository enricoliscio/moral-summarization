Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words used by the author. Let me first read through the article to identify those words.

The article talks about the new crew settling in at the International Space Station. It mentions the astronauts and cosmonauts moving in, installing seat liners, space suits, and transferring gear. The moral framing words might include "settled in," "half-year stay," "couldn't wait," "peeking," "finally," "reflecting," "psychological support device," and "dirty laundry, trash."

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. I'll need to condense the information without losing the essence of the moral perspective. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include all the key points: the arrival of the new crew, their tasks upon arrival, the transfer of the cargo carrier, and their personal items.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the new crew, their arrival, the tasks they had to do before settling in, the transfer of the Raffaello carrier, and then their personal touches. I'll end with the departing crew's mission duration.

Let me make sure to include the morally framed words naturally within the summary. Also, I should keep the summary clear and within the word limit. I'll start by stating the new crew's arrival and their half-year stay, then move on to the tasks, the cargo transfer, personal items, and conclude with the departing crew's time in space.

Double-checking to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved. I think this approach will meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY:  
Two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut have settled in for a half-year stay at the International Space Station (ISS). After arriving aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, they installed their seat liners and space suits before officially calling the ISS home. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, eager to take over as commander, couldn't wait to peek through the window as the hatch opened. The new crew, including astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, will remain on board until May. Meanwhile, the departing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space. The shuttle's robot arm transferred an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with three tons of supplies, which will later be filled with dirty laundry, trash, and used equipment for the return trip. The new residents also brought personal items reflecting their hobbies, such as Onufrienko's fly-tying materials, Bursch's weaving supplies, and Walz's five-octave keyboard, described as a "psychological support device."
