Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They've provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about a new crew settling into the International Space Station. The key points are the arrival of the crew, their tasks, the transfer of equipment, and their personal items. The author used words like "settled in," "couldn't wait," "reflecting," and "psychological support device." These words carry a positive tone, emphasizing readiness, eagerness, personal touches, and support.

I should make sure to include these words to maintain the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning the crew's arrival and their eagerness to take over. Then, I'll note their personal items, highlighting how they reflect their hobbies. Finally, I'll mention the transfer of the cargo carrier and the outgoing crew's stay duration.

I need to keep the summary concise. Let me structure it: arrival, Onufrienko's eagerness, personal items, cargo transfer, and the outgoing crew's return. I'll ensure each sentence is clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the morally framed words and key details without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut have settled in at the International Space Station for a half-year mission. The crew, including Yuri Onufrienko, Daniel Bursch, and Carl Walz, arrived aboard Endeavour and quickly got to work installing their equipment. Onufrienko, eager to take over as commander, couldn't wait to begin his duties. The new residents brought personal items reflecting their hobbies, such as fly-tying materials for Onufrienko, weaving supplies for Bursch, and a keyboard for Walz, described as a "psychological support device." Meanwhile, the outgoing crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth in a week after spending 128 days in space. The transfer of the Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies and later filled with trash and used equipment, marked a smooth transition for the space station's new inhabitants. END OF SUMMARY.
