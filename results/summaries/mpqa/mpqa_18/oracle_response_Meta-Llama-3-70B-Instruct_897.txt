SUMMARY:

A new crew of three men, consisting of two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. The crew, led by Russian Yuri Onufrienko, who "couldn't wait" to take over as commander, brought with them personal items that reflect their hobbies, showcasing their humanity in the vastness of space. Onufrienko, a fisherman, brought material to tie flies, while Daniel Bursch has weaving material to make small baskets, and Carl Walz has a "psychological support device" in the form of a five-octave keyboard. As they settle in, they are tasked with unloading three tons of essential supplies, including food, clothes, and science experiments, from the Italian-built cargo carrier Raffaello. The carrier will later be filled with "dirty laundry, trash and used equipment" to be taken back to Earth. The outgoing crew, who have spent 128 days in space, will return to Earth in a week, marking the end of their remarkable journey.
