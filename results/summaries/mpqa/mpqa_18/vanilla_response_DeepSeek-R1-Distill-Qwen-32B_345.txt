Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the new crew arriving at the International Space Station. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut arrived at the ISS on Saturday. They're staying for half a year. They came aboard the space shuttle Endeavour the day before, but there wasn't enough time to swap with the existing crew immediately because they had to move their seat liners and suits.

The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, who's taking over as commander from Frank Culbertson. Onufrienko was eager to start, peeking through the window before the hatch opened. The other astronauts are Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz. They'll stay until May.

They used the shuttle's robot arm to attach a cargo carrier called Raffaello, which has three tons of supplies. Once emptied, it'll be filled with trash and returned to Endeavour. The new crew also brought personal items: Onufrienko has fly-tying materials, Bursch has weaving stuff, and Walz has a keyboard for psychological support.

The outgoing crew, led by Culbertson, has been there since August and will return in a week after 128 days in space.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: who arrived, their mission duration, the process of moving in, the new commander, the cargo transfer, and the personal items. I'll make sure to include the names and their roles, the transfer of command, and the purpose of the cargo carrier. Also, mention the personal touches to show their interests.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the arrival, then the process, the new commander, the cargo, and the personal items. Keep it concise, avoiding unnecessary details.

Let me put it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, along with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday for a six-month mission. Their arrival followed the transfer of command from outgoing American astronaut Frank Culbertson, who has been on the station since August. The new crew spent their first day moving equipment, including their space suits and seat liners, and attaching the Italian-built cargo carrier Raffaello, which contains three tons of supplies. Once emptied, Raffaello will be filled with trash and returned to the shuttle. The crew also brought personal items reflecting their hobbies: Onufrienko brought fly-tying materials, Bursch weaving supplies, and Walz a keyboard for psychological support. Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, Mikhail Tyurin and Vladimir Dezhurov, will return to Earth in a week after 128 days in space. END OF SUMMARY.
