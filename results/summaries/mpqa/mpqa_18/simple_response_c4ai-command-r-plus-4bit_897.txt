SUMMARY: Three astronauts, American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, have arrived at the International Space Station via the space shuttle Endeavour and will be staying for a half-year mission. Onufrienko will be the commander of the mission, taking over from current commander, American Frank Culbertson. The new crew brought with them personal items reflecting their hobbies: Onufrienko brought materials for fly-tying, Bursch brought weaving material for basket-making, and Walz brought a five-octave keyboard for psychological support. The crew will spend a total of 128 days in space before returning to Earth. This story highlights the international cooperation and the human element that is often overlooked in the complex and technological world of space exploration. The personal touches brought by the crew remind us that even in the vastness of space, our individual interests and hobbies can bring comfort and a sense of home.
