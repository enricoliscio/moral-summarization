STEP 1:
* support
* home

SUMMARY:
A new crew of three men, including two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. As they moved in, they brought with them personal items that reflect their hobbies, such as fishing gear, weaving material, and a "psychological support device" in the form of a five-octave keyboard. The cosmonaut, Yuri Onufrienko, couldn't wait to take over as space station commander, peeking through a small window before the hatch finally swung open. The crew will remain on board until May, during which time they will unpack three tons of food, clothes, science experiments, and spare parts from the Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello. As they settle into their new "home", they will also pack up dirty laundry, trash, and used equipment to be taken back to Earth. The outgoing crew, who have spent 128 days in space, will return to Earth in another week. END OF SUMMARY.
