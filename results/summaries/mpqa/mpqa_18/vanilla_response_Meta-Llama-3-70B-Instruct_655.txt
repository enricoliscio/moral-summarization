SUMMARY:

Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko have settled into the International Space Station (ISS) for a six-month stay. They arrived on Saturday aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, replacing the previous crew who had been on board since August. Before moving in, the new crew had to install their lifeboat seat liners and stow away their space suits. Onufrienko, who will serve as ISS commander until May, was eager to take over and was seen peeking through a window before the hatch opened. The crew also transferred cargo from the shuttle to the station, including a Italian-built carrier named Raffaello, which is loaded with food, clothes, and science experiments. The astronauts also brought personal items, such as fly-tying material, weaving supplies, and a keyboard. The previous crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth in a week, after spending 128 days in space.
