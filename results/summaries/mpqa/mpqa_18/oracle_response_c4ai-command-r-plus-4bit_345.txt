SUMMARY: A happy new crew of astronauts and cosmonauts are settling into their new home in space, bringing with them not only essential supplies but also personal items to make their stay more enjoyable. Yuri Onufrienko, an eager cosmonaut, will take over as the space station commander, replacing the current American commander, Frank Culbertson, who has faithfully served his 128-day duty. Onufrienko and his crew, astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, will reside on the International Space Station for the next six months. The new crew traveled aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, bringing with them three tons of essential supplies, including food, clothes, scientific experiments, and spare parts. They also packed personal items that reflect their interests and hobbies. Onufrienko, a fisherman, brought materials for tying flies, while Bursch brought weaving material for basket-making, and Walz included a five-octave keyboard for musical entertainment and "psychological support." The current crew, including Culbertson and his Russian crewmates, will return to Earth in a week, completing their commendable four-month mission. The new residents are excited to make the space station their home and are eager to unpack their personal belongings, ensuring a pleasant and productive stay.
