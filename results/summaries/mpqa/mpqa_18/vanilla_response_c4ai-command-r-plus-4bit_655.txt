SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut joined the International Space Station on Saturday, beginning their six-month stay. They arrived aboard space shuttle Endeavour, but had to wait to trade places with the current space station crew. The new crew includes Russian Yuri Onufrienko, who will serve as the space station commander, and astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz. They brought along personal items reflecting their hobbies, including fishing gear, weaving material, and a keyboard. Before they could settle in, the new crew had to install their lifeboat seat liners and stow their space suits. Meanwhile, Endeavour's astronauts used the ship's robot arm to attach an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies and equipment, to the space station. The current space station crew, consisting of American Frank Culbertson and Russians Mikhail Tyurin and Vladimir Dezhurov, will return to Earth in a week after spending 128 days in space.
END OF SUMMARY.
