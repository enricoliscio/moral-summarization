SUMMARY:
A new crew of three men, including Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko and American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, has settled into the International Space Station for a half-year stay. As they make the space station their new "home", they bring personal items that reflect their hobbies, such as fishing gear, weaving material, and a keyboard that serves as a "psychological support device". The crew is busy unpacking a cargo carrier loaded with essential supplies, including food, clothes, and science experiments. As they prepare for their extended stay, they are also getting ready to take over from the previous crew, who will return to Earth after 128 days in space. The new residents are eager to start their mission, with Onufrienko taking the reins as space station commander.
