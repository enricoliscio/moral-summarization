SUMMARY:

Two American astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, and one Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Onufrienko, have settled into the International Space Station (ISS) for a six-month stay. They arrived on Saturday aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, replacing the previous crew who had been on board since August. Before taking over, the new crew had to install their lifeboat seat liners and stow away their space suits. Onufrienko will serve as the new ISS commander until May. The crew also transferred a cargo carrier, Raffaello, from the shuttle to the station, which is loaded with three tons of supplies, including food, clothes, and science experiments. The carrier will be emptied and refilled with trash and used equipment before being returned to the shuttle. The new residents also brought personal items, such as fly-tying material, weaving supplies, and a keyboard, to pass the time during their long stay.
