SUMMARY:
Three astronauts, two Americans and one Russian, have arrived at the International Space Station aboard the space shuttle Endeavour and are settling in for a six-month stay. The new crew, including commander Yuri Onufrienko and astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, had to wait to trade places with the current space station crew while their custom-fitted seat liners and space suits were transferred over. Onufrienko, an eager fisherman, was excited to take command of the space station, bringing along his fishing gear to tie flies during his downtime. Bursch and Walz also brought along their own hobbies, with Bursch bringing weaving material for basket-making and Walz packing a five-octave keyboard for entertainment. The crew will spend the next week unloading three tons of supplies, food, and experiments from the Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, and will fill it with trash and used equipment for the return trip. The current space station crew, led by American Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space.
