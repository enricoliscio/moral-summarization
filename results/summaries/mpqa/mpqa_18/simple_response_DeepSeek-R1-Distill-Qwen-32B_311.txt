Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the new crew settling into the International Space Station. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what "moral framing" means here. Maybe it refers to the tone or the values presented in the article, like cooperation, teamwork, or the spirit of exploration.

Let me read the article again. It talks about the new crew arriving, installing their equipment, and the transfer of command. There's also mention of the astronauts bringing personal items like fishing gear and a keyboard for morale. The author seems to highlight the smooth transition and the personal touches, which might be the moral aspectâ€”showing how astronauts maintain their humanity and hobbies even in such a challenging environment.

I should focus on the key points: the arrival of the new crew, the transfer process, the installation of gear, the new commander taking over, and the personal items they brought. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the summary reflects the positive and cooperative tone.

Wait, the user also specified that the summary should come after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to format it correctly without using markdown. I'll make sure to include all the important details concisely, highlighting the teamwork and personal elements to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut have joined the International Space Station for a six-month mission. After arriving on the space shuttle Endeavour, they installed their equipment and prepared for their stay. Yuri Onufrienko, the new commander, took over from Frank Culbertson. The crew transferred a cargo carrier named Raffaello, loaded with supplies, and prepared for the return of the outgoing crew. The new residents also brought personal items reflecting their hobbies, such as fishing gear, weaving materials, and a keyboard for morale. The outgoing crew, who spent 128 days in space, will return soon. This smooth transition highlights the ongoing cooperation and dedication in space exploration. END OF SUMMARY.
