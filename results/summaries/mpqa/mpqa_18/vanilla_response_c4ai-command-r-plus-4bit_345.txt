SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut have arrived at the International Space Station aboard the space shuttle Endeavour to begin their six-month mission. The new crew, comprised of Yuri Onufrienko, Daniel Bursch, and Carl Walz, will be staying on the space station until May. The handover between the new and former crew was delayed as the personalized seat liners and space suits had to be transferred over from Endeavour. The new crew also brought personal items to occupy their time, such as fly-tying materials for Onufrienko's fishing hobby and a five-octave keyboard for Walz. The Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, was also attached to the space station, carrying three tons of supplies. The former crew, led by Frank Culbertson, will return to Earth after 128 days in space.
END OF SUMMARY.
