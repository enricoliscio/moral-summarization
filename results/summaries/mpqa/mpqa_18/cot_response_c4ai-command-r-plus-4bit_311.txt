SUMMARY:
A new crew has arrived at the International Space Station, ready to begin their half-year *stay*. American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, along with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, joined the existing crew, led by American Frank Culbertson. The new crew had to wait while their personalized *home* setups were transferred, along with their *packed* hobbies and personal items. The handover included the installation of form-fitting seat liners for their lifeboat and the stowing away of their space suits. Onufrienko eagerly awaited his turn to command the space station. During their time on the station, the new crew will benefit from the delivery of an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, which is loaded with essential supplies, including food, clothes, science experiments, and spare parts. Once their mission is complete, the crew will return to Earth with the cargo carrier filled with *dirty* laundry, trash, and used equipment. The current crew, led by Culbertson, will return to Earth after spending 128 days in space.
END OF SUMMARY.
