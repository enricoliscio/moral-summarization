SUMMARY: A new crew has arrived at the International Space Station, ready to take on a half-year mission. American astronauts Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, along with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufrienko, bring with them not only essential gear but also personal items reflecting their passions. Onufrienko, an eager fisherman, brought materials for tying flies. Bursch packed weaving material to craft small baskets, and Walz included a five-octave keyboard for psychological support. The handover process involves the transfer of gear and the installation of customized seat liners in the lifeboat. The Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, plays a crucial role in this mission, providing essential supplies and serving as a means to dispose of waste. This mission exemplifies the dedication and passion that astronauts bring to their work, ensuring that even in the vastness of space, they find comfort and purpose in their hobbies and personal touches.
