Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the new crew settling into the International Space Station. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut arrived at the ISS on Saturday. They're staying for half a year. They came aboard the space shuttle Endeavour the day before, but couldn't immediately swap with the existing crew because they had to move their seat liners and space suits first.

The new crew includes Yuri Onufrienko, who's taking over as commander. He was eager to start his role. The other astronauts are Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz. They'll stay until May. 

During their time, they used the shuttle's robot arm to attach a cargo carrier called Raffaello, which has three tons of supplies. After unloading, it'll be filled with trash and old equipment to bring back. 

Each crew member brought personal items: Onufrienko has fishing gear, Bursch weaving materials, and Walz a keyboard for psychological support. The outgoing crew has been there since August and will return after a week, having spent 128 days in space.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the arrival, the crew members, their stay duration, the cargo transfer, and their personal items. I'll make sure to mention the commander change and the return of the outgoing crew.

Let me structure it: start with the arrival and their mission duration. Then mention the cargo transfer and the robot arm. Finally, note their personal items and the outgoing crew's return. Keep it concise and clear.

I think that's all the main points. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY:  
Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday for a six-month mission. The crew, including Yuri Onufrienko, Daniel Bursch, and Carl Walz, took over from the outgoing crew led by Frank Culbertson. They installed their equipment and used the shuttle's robot arm to attach a cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies. The carrier will later return with trash and used items. The new crew brought personal items reflecting their hobbies: Onufrienko brought fishing gear, Bursch weaving materials, and Walz a keyboard for psychological support. The outgoing crew, which has spent 128 days in space, will return to Earth in a week.  
END OF SUMMARY.
