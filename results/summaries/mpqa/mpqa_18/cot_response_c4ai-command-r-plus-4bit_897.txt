SUMMARY: Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut have *settled into their new home* — the International Space Station — for a six-month mission. The new crew, which arrived aboard space shuttle Endeavour, includes Russian Yuri Onufrienko, who will take over command of the station. Before they could officially move in, the crew had to wait for their customized seat liners and space suits to be installed. Onufrienko, an eager fisherman, brought materials to tie flies, while the other astronauts, Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz, brought weaving supplies and a keyboard for their *hobbies*. The crew also unpacked *personal items* and *reflecting* their interests. In the meantime, the robot arm of the shuttle was used to attach an Italian-built cargo carrier, Raffaello, loaded with supplies and equipment to the station. The previous crew, including American Frank Culbertson and two Russian cosmonauts, will return to Earth after a 128-day mission.
END OF SUMMARY.
