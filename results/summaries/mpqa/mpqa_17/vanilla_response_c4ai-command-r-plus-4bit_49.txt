SUMMARY: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez was briefly removed from office last week in a coup led by military officers and supported by business groups and labor unions. Chavez, who was elected three years ago, has abused his power and engaged in heavy-handed tactics, threatening the country's democracy. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators hint at his inclinations towards gaining more power. However, Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The coup was triggered by Chavez's attempt to gain control of the state-owned oil company, which led to protests and eventually, the military's intervention. International pressure and domestic support forced the generals to reinstate Chavez. The US administration's initial welcome of the coup tarnished its image as a champion of democracy. Venezuela now has a chance to move forward and restore its democratic values by removing Chavez through constitutional means.
