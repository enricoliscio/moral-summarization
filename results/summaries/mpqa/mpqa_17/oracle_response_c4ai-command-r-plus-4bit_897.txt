SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny with tyranny last week was a clear failure. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader turned elected official, has abused his power with heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he largely rewrote himself. His economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, while his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators hint at his power-grabbing inclinations. The attempted coup, sparked by Chavez's stacking of the state-owned oil company board, backfired when international pressure and domestic support forced the plotters to reinstate Chavez. The US administration's welcome of the coup tarnished its image as a democracy champion. Latin America has progressed beyond coups, and Venezuela must now demonstrate its commitment to democracy by removing Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The country has the means to do so, and the pent-up opposition to Chavez's tyrannical tactics is strong. Business groups and labor unions have joined forces in protest, and portions of the military are on their side. It is time for Venezuela to end the cycle of tyranny and coups and embrace a peaceful, democratic path forward.
END OF SUMMARY.
