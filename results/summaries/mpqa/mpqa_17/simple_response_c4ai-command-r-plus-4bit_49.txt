SUMMARY: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez was briefly removed from power in a coup last week, but has since been reinstated. Chavez, a former Army coup leader himself, has abused his power and implemented heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he largely rewrote himself. His economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators raise concerns about his inclinations towards gaining more power. However, Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela must now demonstrate its commitment to democracy by removing Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The coup, triggered by Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company, was a result of pent-up opposition from business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military. While the Bush administration seemed to welcome the coup, they, along with the coup-plotters and Chavez himself, must now recognize the importance of respecting democratic processes in Latin America. Venezuela has the opportunity to set an example for the hemisphere by removing Chavez through peaceful, constitutional means. END OF SUMMARY.
