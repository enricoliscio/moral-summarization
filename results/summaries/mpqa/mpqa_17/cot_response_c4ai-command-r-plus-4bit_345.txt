SUMMARY:
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader himself, has been abusing his power and overstepping his mandate. His undemocratic actions, including attempts to consolidate control over the state-owned oil company, have sparked opposition from business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military. The article argues that while Chavez's removal from office last week was a response to his tyrannical tactics, the coup was not the right way to address the issue. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela, as a pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies, has the means to remove Chavez by constitutional and nonviolent means. The article also criticizes the Bush administration's response to the coup, saying they "all but welcomed" it, tarnishing the US's role as a champion of democracy. It calls for a return to constitutional and democratic principles in Venezuela and for Chavez to respect the limits of his mandate. It also emphasizes the need for nonviolent solutions to political conflicts in Latin America.
