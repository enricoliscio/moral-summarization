SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny with tyranny did not succeed last week. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader himself, has abused his power with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to his advantage and suggesting he may stay in office beyond 2020. His economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, while his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators hint at his power-grabbing inclinations. The attempted coup, sparked by Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company, revealed the pent-up opposition to his rule. Despite the tragic loss of life during the march on the presidential palace, the involvement of business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military showed that Latin America has moved beyond accepting coups as a means of removing leaders from power. International pressure and domestic support for Chavez forced the generals to reinstate him, but the US's welcoming of the coup tarnished its image as a democracy champion. Venezuela must now find a constitutional and nonviolent way to end Chavez's tyrannical rule.
END OF SUMMARY.
