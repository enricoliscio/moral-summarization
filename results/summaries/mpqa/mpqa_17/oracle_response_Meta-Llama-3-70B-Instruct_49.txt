SUMMARY:

Venezuela's experiment with fighting tyranny with tyranny has failed. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to suit his supporters. His economic promises to the poor lie in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil, sparking widespread opposition. A giant protest ensued, joined by business groups and labor unions, with portions of the military on their side. Gunshots fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen, forced Chavez to step aside. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit welcoming of the coup tarnishes the US role as a champion of democracy. Latin America must move beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. END OF SUMMARY.
