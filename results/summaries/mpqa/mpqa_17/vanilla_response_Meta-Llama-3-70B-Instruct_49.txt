SUMMARY:

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a former army coup leader, has been accused of abusing his power and using tyrannical tactics. He was briefly removed from office after trying to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, sparking widespread protests and opposition from business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military. However, international pressure and domestic support led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US's role as a champion of democracy. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means.

END OF SUMMARY.
