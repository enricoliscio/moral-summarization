SUMMARY:

The recent events in Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez was briefly removed from office, highlight the dangers of tyranny and the need for democratic values. Chavez, a former army coup leader, has abused his power and rewritten the Constitution to consolidate his grip on power. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic flirtations with leftist dictators raise concerns about his intentions. The catalyst for the opposition was Chavez's attempt to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, leading to a massive protest joined by business groups and labor unions. International pressure and domestic support eventually led to Chavez's reinstatement, but not before the Bush administration's welcoming of the coup tarnished the US's reputation as a champion of democracy. The episode serves as a reminder that Latin America has moved beyond coups and that democratic means can be used to remove leaders who abuse their power.
