SUMMARY:
Venezuela witnessed a tumultuous week as President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader turned elected leader, faced a coup attempt. Chavez has been criticized for his heavy-handed rule, with accusations of abusing his mandate and rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators raise concerns about his intentions to gain more power. The coup attempt, sparked by Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company, revealed the pent-up opposition to his rule. Business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military joined forces in a giant protest march on the presidential palace, resulting in gunshots that killed over a dozen people. Chavez was temporarily removed from office by military leaders but was reinstated due to international pressure and renewed domestic support. The Bush administration's reaction to the coup attempt tarnished the US's image as a democracy advocate. Moving forward, Venezuela must demonstrate its commitment to democracy by removing Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The country has the potential to lead Latin America away from coups and towards a hemisphere of stable democracies.
