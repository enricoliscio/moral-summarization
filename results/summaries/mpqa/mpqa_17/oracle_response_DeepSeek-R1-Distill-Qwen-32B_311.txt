Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about a coup in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez was temporarily removed. The author uses words like "tyranny," "coup-plotting," and "abused" to describe Chavez's actions. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll note that Chavez rewrote the Constitution and used heavy-handed measures, which are part of the moral framing. His economic failures and diplomatic moves are also highlighted, so I'll include terms like "flirtation" and "gain more power."

The opposition involved business groups and unions, leading to protests and violence, which resulted in Chavez's temporary removal. However, international pressure, especially from the U.S., which welcomed the coup, led to his reinstatement. The author criticizes the U.S. for tarnishing its role as a democracy champion.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include all these elements, making sure to use the specified moral terms. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

I'll start by stating the main event, then mention Chavez's actions, the opposition's response, the coup, and the aftermath, including the U.S.'s role. I'll ensure each morally framed word is included where appropriate without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details while covering all key points. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each event with the moral terms provided.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all specified words are included and that the moral framing is preserved as per the author's original stance.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the fight against tyranny has taken a chaotic turn, with coup-plotting military officers and President Hugo Chavez engaging in tyrannical tactics. Chavez, who came to power through a coup himself, has abused his mandate by rewriting the Constitution and implementing heavy-handed measures. His economic promises to the poor have fallen apart, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators suggests a desire to gain more power. The opposition, including business groups and labor unions, rose against him, revolting after he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company. This led to protests and violence, with gunshots killing over a dozen during a march on the presidential palace. Military leaders forced Chavez to step aside, but international pressure and renewed domestic support for him compelled the generals to restore him to power. The Bush administration's near-welcoming of the coup tarnished the U.S.'s role as a democracy champion, highlighting the region's struggle to move beyond coups and embrace constitutional means to remove leaders. END OF SUMMARY.
