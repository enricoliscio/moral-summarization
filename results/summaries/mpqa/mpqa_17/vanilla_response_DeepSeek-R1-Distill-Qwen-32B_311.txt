Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with "Veni, Vidi, Venezuela FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work." That sounds like it's about political turmoil. It mentions Hugo Chavez, who was a former coup leader and was elected three years ago. He's been using heavy-handed measures based on a constitution he rewrote. He wants to stay president past 2020, which is a long time. His economic promises to the poor aren't holding up, and he's been friendly with leftist dictators, suggesting he wants more power.

Then it says Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela, being a key democracy in the hemisphere, can remove Chavez through constitutional, nonviolent means. The two-day removal started when Chavez tried to stack the board of the state oil company. The executives revolted, threatening to cut off oil, which led to protests from business and labor groups, knowing some military supported them. Gunshots during a march killed over a dozen, leading military leaders to make Chavez step aside. But international pressure and renewed support for Chavez made the generals let him return.

The Bush administration almost welcomed the coup, which hurt their image as a democracy champion. They have reasons to repent.

So, the main points are:

1. Venezuela's political instability with Chavez's heavy-handed tactics.
2. His attempt to control the oil company led to protests and a coup attempt.
3. The coup failed due to international pressure and support for Chavez.
4. The Bush administration's stance tarnished their image.
5. The region's move towards democracy and nonviolent solutions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key events and implications without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Venezuela's political instability escalated as President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader, faced a two-day removal from office after attempting to control the state oil company. His heavy-handed tactics, including rewriting the constitution and seeking extended power, fueled opposition. Protests, supported by business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military, led to a coup attempt following violence during a march on the presidential palace. International pressure and renewed support for Chavez forced his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit approval of the coup damaged its image as a democracy advocate. Latin America's shift toward constitutional and nonviolent solutions underscores the need for democratic norms in resolving political conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
