Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Venezuela's political situation, specifically involving Hugo Chavez and a coup attempt. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these as possible without making it too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how Chavez, who was once a coup leader himself, has become a tyrant. He's abusing his power, rewriting the Constitution, making economic promises that didn't hold, and flirting with other dictators. The opposition, including business groups and labor unions, along with some military support, managed to remove him briefly through a coup. But international pressure and domestic support brought him back. The US, under Bush, seemed to support the coup, which tarnished their image as promoters of democracy.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like tyranny, coup-plotting, tactics, abused, measures, rewritten, shreds, flirtation, gain, coups, remove, means, stack, revolted, threatening, cutoff, opposition, joined, protest, gunshots, killing, forced, take, welcomed, coup, tarnishing.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Chavez's rise to power, his tyrannical actions, the coup attempt, the opposition's role, the violence, and the international response. I need to weave in the moral words naturally.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Chavez as a former coup leader turned tyrant. Mention his heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution, economic failures, and diplomatic alliances. Then, explain how the opposition, including business and unions, along with military support, led to his temporary removal. Highlight the violence and the role of international pressure in bringing him back. Finally, note the US's stance and how it affected their reputation.

I need to make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. For example, "Venezuela's former coup leader, Hugo Chavez, has become a tyrant" uses "tyranny" and "coup-plotting." I can mention his measures, the rewritten Constitution, economic promises in shreds, and flirtation with dictators. The opposition's means to remove him, stacking the board, revolt, threatening cutoff, opposition joining protests, gunshots, killing, forced removal, and international pressure leading to his reinstatement. The US welcoming the coup and tarnishing their image.

I should also keep the summary concise, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll need to be efficient with each sentence, combining events and using the moral terms appropriately. Let me draft it step by step, checking each sentence for the inclusion of the required words and the overall flow.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary is clear and coherent, avoiding any unnecessary details that might exceed the word limit.

SUMMARY: Venezuela's former coup leader, Hugo Chavez, has become a tyrant, abusing his power through heavy-handed measures and a Constitution largely rewritten to his favor. His economic promises to the poor lie in shreds, and his flirtation with leftist dictators highlights his desire to gain more power. Last week, opposition groups, including business and labor unions, joined a protest, knowing portions of the military supported them. Gunshots during a march on the presidential palace killed over a dozen, forcing Chavez to step aside temporarily. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez compelled military leaders to restore him to power. The Bush administration's near-welcoming of the coup tarnished the U.S. image as a democracy champion, revealing its own reasons to repent. The author emphasizes that Latin America has moved beyond coups, and nonviolent means could remove Chavez, but the violent tactics and coup attempt underscore the region's ongoing struggle with tyranny and democratic norms. END OF SUMMARY.
