SUMMARY: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader, was briefly removed from office last week through a combination of military force and popular protest. Chavez's authoritarian tendencies, economic failures, and diplomatic ties with dictators had fueled opposition to his rule. While Latin America has moved beyond coups as a means of regime change, Chavez's removal highlights the region's commitment to constitutional and nonviolent solutions. The presence of pent-up opposition, portions of the military willing to act against Chavez, and the catalyst of the state-owned oil company's revolt set the stage for his ouster. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support ultimately led to Chavez being reinstated as president. The US initially welcomed the coup but later regretted its position as a champion of democracy. The episode underscores the region's rejection of tyrannical rule and its embrace of democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
