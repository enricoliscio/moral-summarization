Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about Venezuela's political turmoil, focusing on Hugo Chavez's actions and the coup attempt. I should highlight the moral issues like tyranny, Chavez's abuse of power, and the regional implications. I'll also mention the Bush administration's stance and its impact on US credibility. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and making sure the moral elements are clear.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the political turmoil in Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez, once a coup leader himself, has been accused of abusing his power and implementing a Constitution that consolidates his control. Chavez's heavy-handed tactics, economic failures, and alignment with leftist dictators have drawn criticism. A coup attempt, supported by military officers and opposition groups, temporarily removed him from power but ultimately failed due to international pressure and domestic support for Chavez. The article highlights the moral failing of using tyranny to combat tyranny, emphasizing that Latin America has moved beyond coups and should resolve conflicts through constitutional and nonviolent means. The Bush administration's tacit approval of the coup further undermines its role as a democracy advocate, suggesting a need for repentance. The situation underscores the importance of democratic principles and the dangers of power consolidation. END OF SUMMARY.
