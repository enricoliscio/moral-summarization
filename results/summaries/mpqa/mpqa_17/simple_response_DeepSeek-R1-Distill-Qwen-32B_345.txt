Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela's political situation. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by talking about Venezuela's recent coup attempt and how using tyranny to fight tyranny didn't work. It mentions Hugo Chavez, who was a former coup leader himself and was elected three years ago. The author seems critical of Chavez, pointing out that he's abused his power, rewritten the Constitution, and has economic failures. The author also mentions Chavez's alliance with leftist dictators, implying he's power-hungry.

Then, the article describes the events leading to his removal: Chavez tried to control the oil company, which led to protests and a coup. But then international pressure, especially from the Bush administration, which supported the coup, caused him to be reinstated. The author criticizes the US for not championing democracy.

So, the moral framing here is about the failure of authoritarian tactics and the US's complicity in undermining democracy. The summary needs to capture this critique without adding my own opinions, just reflecting the author's stance.

I should structure the summary to include: Chavez's authoritarian actions, the coup and its consequences, the role of the US, and the message about the need for constitutional and nonviolent change in Latin America.

I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the political turmoil in Venezuela, where attempts to combat tyranny with tyranny have failed. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader and elected leader, has abused his power by rewriting the Constitution and pursuing authoritarian measures. His economic failures and alignment with leftist dictators highlight his quest for greater power. Last week, a coup attempt against him was sparked by his attempt to control the state oil company, leading to widespread protests and military intervention. However, international pressure, particularly from the Bush administration, which tacitly supported the coup, led to Chavez's reinstatement. The author criticizes the U.S. for undermining its role as a democracy advocate. The situation underscores the need for constitutional and nonviolent solutions in a region moving beyond coups. END OF SUMMARY.
