SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny took a troubling turn last week, as military officers and President Hugo Chavez employed undemocratic tactics. Chavez, who came to power through a coup himself, has abused his position by consolidating power and rewriting the Constitution to his advantage. His economic promises have failed, and his diplomatic ties with dictators indicate his lust for power. However, Latin America has evolved beyond coups, and Venezuela, as a pivotal nation in a democratic hemisphere, must demonstrate its commitment to constitutional and nonviolent means of resolving political conflicts. Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company sparked opposition from business and labor groups, who were joined by factions within the military. The resulting violence and Chavez's brief removal from office revealed the fragility of Venezuela's democracy and the need for a nonviolent, constitutional resolution. Even the US, which initially supported the coup, must now advocate for democratic processes. Venezuela and the US must learn from this episode and commit to upholding democratic values and rejecting tyrannical tendencies. END OF SUMMARY.
