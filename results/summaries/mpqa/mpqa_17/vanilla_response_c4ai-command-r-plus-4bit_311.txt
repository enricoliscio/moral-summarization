SUMMARY: Last week, Venezuela witnessed a failed coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez, who had previously come to power through a military coup himself. Chavez, despite being democratically elected, abused his power by rewriting the Constitution to consolidate his rule and flirting with leftist dictators. The catalyst for the coup was Chavez's attempt to take control of the state-owned oil company, which led to protests from business and labor groups, as well as portions of the military. While Chavez was briefly removed from office, international pressure and domestic support forced the generals to reinstate him. The article argues that Latin America has moved beyond coups and that Chavez should be removed through constitutional and nonviolent means. It also criticizes the Bush administration for seemingly welcoming the coup, undermining its position as a champion of democracy. The failure of the coup highlights the need for a non-violent and constitutional resolution to political conflicts in Venezuela and Latin America. END OF SUMMARY.
