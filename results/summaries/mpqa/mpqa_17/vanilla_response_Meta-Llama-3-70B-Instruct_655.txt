SUMMARY:

Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former army coup leader, has been accused of abusing his power and using tyrannical tactics. His attempts to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor led to widespread protests and opposition from business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military. Chavez was forced to step aside after gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen people. However, international pressure and domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US's role as a champion of democracy. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. Chavez's economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators raises concerns about his desire for more power.
