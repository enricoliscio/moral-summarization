SUMMARY:

Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former army coup leader, has been accused of abusing his power and using tyrannical tactics. His attempts to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor led to widespread protests and eventually, his removal from office for two days. However, international pressure and domestic support forced the generals to reinstate him. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US's role as a champion of democracy. Chavez's economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic relations with leftist dictators have raised concerns about his intentions to gain more power. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The country must now work towards a democratic solution and prevent further tyranny.

END OF SUMMARY.
