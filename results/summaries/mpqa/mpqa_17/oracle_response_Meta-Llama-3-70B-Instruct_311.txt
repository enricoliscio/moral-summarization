SUMMARY:

Venezuela's struggle against tyranny has taken a dark turn as President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures. His tactics have been tyrannical, rewriting the Constitution to favor himself and his supporters. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil. This sparked widespread opposition, with business groups and labor unions joining in a giant protest. Military leaders forced Chavez to step aside after gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit welcome of the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy. Latin America must move beyond coups and use constitutional and nonviolent means to remove tyrannical leaders like Chavez.

END OF SUMMARY.
