SUMMARY:

The recent coup in Venezuela, led by military officers, has failed to bring about change, and instead, has highlighted the need for an end to tyrannical tactics in the region. President Hugo Chavez, a former army coup leader himself, has abused his power and popular mandate, imposing heavy-handed measures and rewriting the Constitution to suit his interests. His economic promises to the poor have been unfulfilled, and his diplomatic relationships with leftist dictators have raised concerns about his desire for more power. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The international community, including the US, must also repent for welcoming the coup and tarnishing its role as a champion of democracy. It is time for Venezuela to move towards a more democratic and peaceful path.
