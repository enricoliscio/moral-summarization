SUMMARY:
Venezuela's fight against tyranny took a troubling turn last week, revealing the challenges of combating authoritarianism without resorting to undemocratic means. President Hugo Chavez, himself a former coup participant turned elected leader, has abused his power with heavy-handed tactics. His rewriting of the Constitution and economic failures have fueled opposition, as has his ambiguous relationship with leftist dictators. The recent events began when Chavez attempted to consolidate control over the state-owned oil company, sparking a revolt. A bloody confrontation during a protest march led to his temporary removal from office by the military. However, international pressure and domestic support forced the generals to reinstate him. The US response, falling short of endorsing the coup, tarnished its image as a champion of democracy. Latin America must now demonstrate its commitment to democracy by finding constitutional and nonviolent ways to address Chavez's authoritarian tendencies. The region has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela, a pivotal nation, must show that it can uphold democratic values while removing a leader who threatens them.
END OF SUMMARY.
