SUMMARY: Venezuela experienced a coup attempt last week, with President Hugo Chavez being temporarily removed from office before being reinstated due to international pressure and domestic support. Chavez, a former coup leader himself, has abused his power and implemented heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he largely rewrote. The coup was triggered by Chavez's attempt to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, leading to protests from business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military. While Latin America has moved beyond coups, Chavez can still be removed by constitutional and nonviolent means. The US initially welcomed the coup but later regretted its position as a champion of democracy. Chavez's economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators raise concerns about his power grabs. Venezuela must now find a way to end the cycle of tyranny and establish a stable democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
