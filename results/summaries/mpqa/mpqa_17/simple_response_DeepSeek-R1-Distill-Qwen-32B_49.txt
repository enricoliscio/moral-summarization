Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on both summarizing the content and maintaining the ethical perspective presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Venezuela's political situation, specifically the coup against President Hugo Chavez. The article criticizes Chavez for his authoritarian actions, rewriting the constitution, and his economic failures. It also mentions the international response, particularly the Bush administration's stance, which is portrayed negatively.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The article frames the situation as Chavez using tyrannical tactics despite being elected, which is a key point. Also, the opposition's actions, though resulting in a coup, are shown as a response to Chavez's overreach. The moral framing includes the failure of using tyranny against tyranny and the US's tarnished image for supporting the coup.

I should structure the summary to highlight these elements concisely. Start with the main event, the coup and its context, then move to Chavez's actions and the opposition's reaction. Include the international response, especially the US's role, and the underlying moral implications about democracy and power abuse.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but thorough. Make sure each sentence adds value and maintains the original's critical tone towards Chavez and the US's stance.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all key points without being too verbose. I'll check word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Last week, Venezuela experienced a coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez, highlighting the nation's struggle with authoritarianism. Chavez, a former coup leader himself, was elected three years ago but has since abused his power by rewriting the Constitution and pursuing heavy-handed policies. His economic failures and alignment with leftist dictators have raised concerns about his quest for greater control. The coup began when Chavez attempted to control the state oil company, sparking opposition from business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military. Clashes during a protest led to his temporary removal, but international pressure and renewed support for Chavez forced his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit approval of the coup damaged the U.S.'s image as a democracy advocate. The situation underscores the failure of using tyranny to combat tyranny and the need for Venezuela to embrace constitutional and nonviolent solutions to its political challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
