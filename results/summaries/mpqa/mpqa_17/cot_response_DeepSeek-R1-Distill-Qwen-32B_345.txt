Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela's political situation, preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally charged words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about "tyranny," "coup," "abused," "heavy-handed measures," "rewritten Constitution," "economic promises in shreds," "flirtation with dictators," "nonviolent means," "protest," "gunshots," "killing," "forced," "international pressure," "domestic support," "champion of democracy," and "reason to repent."

Now, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. I should focus on the key events: Chavez's actions, the coup attempt, the opposition, the violence, and the international response. I also need to highlight the moral implications, like the abuse of power and the US's tarnished image.

I'll start by mentioning Chavez's abuse of power and the coup attempt. Then, I'll explain how the opposition used nonviolent means but resorted to force, leading to violence. The international pressure and the US's stance will show the broader implications. Finally, I'll note the need for Venezuela to move away from tyranny and towards democracy.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the key morally framed words. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and maintains the moral framing.

**Summary:**

In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez faced a coup attempt after abusing his power and rewriting the Constitution. His heavy-handed measures and broken economic promises fueled opposition. When he tried to control the state oil company, executives revolted, sparking protests and military involvement. Gunshots during a march led to violence, forcing Chavez to step aside temporarily. However, international pressure and renewed support for Chavez pressured the military to restore him. The U.S., by tacitly supporting the coup, tarnished its role as a democracy champion. Venezuela must now move beyond tyranny and embrace nonviolent, constitutional means to address its democratic challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
