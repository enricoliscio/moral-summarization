SUMMARY:

The recent events in Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez was briefly ousted and then reinstated, highlight the dangers of tyranny and the need for democratic means to remove leaders who abuse their power. Chavez, a former army coup leader himself, has used heavy-handed measures and rewritten the Constitution to consolidate his power, threatening to remain in office until 2020. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic flirtations with leftist dictators raise concerns about his intentions. The opposition, including business groups and labor unions, had been building against Chavez, and his attempt to stack the state-owned oil company's board in his favor sparked a giant protest. The US, which had welcomed the coup, must also repent and support democratic means to remove leaders who abuse their power. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela must find a nonviolent and constitutional way to remove Chavez and uphold democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
