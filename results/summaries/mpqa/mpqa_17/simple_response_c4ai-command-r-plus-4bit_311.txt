SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny through tyrannical means, exemplified by the recent coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez, has proven unsuccessful and detrimental to the country's democratic ideals. Chavez, despite his initial popularity, abused his power and mandate with undemocratic measures, showcasing authoritarian tendencies. The opposition to Chavez, including business groups and labor unions, along with portions of the military, attempted to overthrow him, resulting in violence and loss of life. While Chavez was temporarily removed from office, international pressure and domestic support led to his reinstatement. The undemocratic nature of the coup and the US administration's ambiguous response tarnished the region's democratic reputation. To rectify the situation, Chavez and the coup plotters must abandon their authoritarian tactics and embrace constitutional and nonviolent means to resolve their differences. Latin America has progressed beyond coups, and Venezuela, as a pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies, must demonstrate its commitment to democratic principles and values. The removal of Chavez, if warranted, should be achieved through peaceful and lawful mechanisms that respect the rights and freedoms of all Venezuelans. END OF SUMMARY.
