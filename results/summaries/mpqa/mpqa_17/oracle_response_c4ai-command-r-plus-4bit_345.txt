SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny with tyranny was unsuccessful last week, highlighting the need for a shift away from coup-plotting and tyrannical tactics. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader turned elected official, has abused his power and implemented heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he largely rewrote himself. His economic promises to the poor remain unfulfilled, while his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators raise concerns about his power grab. The recent events began when Chavez attempted to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, sparking opposition from executives and protests from business and labor groups. Gunshots during a march on the presidential palace led to his temporary removal from office, but international pressure and domestic support forced his reinstatement. The US initially welcomed the coup, tarnishing its image as a democracy advocate. Venezuela must now find a constitutional and nonviolent way to remove Chavez and restore democracy. His removal from office exposed his abuse of power and the failure of his promises. The involvement of the military and the use of deadly force highlight the urgency of peaceful and constitutional solutions to remove Chavez from power.
END OF SUMMARY.
