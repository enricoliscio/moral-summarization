SUMMARY:
In Venezuela, the fight against tyranny has been replaced with tyranny itself. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to suit his interests. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire for more power. However, Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The recent coup attempt, which was welcomed by the Bush administration, tarnishing the US role as a champion of democracy, ultimately failed, and Chavez was reinstated. The international community and Venezuelans must now ensure that Chavez's tyrannical tactics come to an end and that democracy prevails. END OF SUMMARY.
