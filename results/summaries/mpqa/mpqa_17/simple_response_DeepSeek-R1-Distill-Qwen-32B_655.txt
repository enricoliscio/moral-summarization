Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Venezuela's political turmoil under Hugo Chavez. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective on the situation.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points. The article talks about Chavez's authoritarian actions, his rewrite of the constitution, economic failures, and support for dictators. It also mentions the coup attempt and the international response, especially from the US.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. The author is critical of Chavez's tyranny and the coup, as well as the US's support for it. So the summary should convey that both Chavez's tactics and the coup were wrong, and that Latin America has moved beyond such methods.

I'll start by mentioning Chavez's actions and his abuse of power. Then, I'll note the coup attempt and the subsequent return to power. I should include the opposition's reasons, like the oil company issue and the protests. It's important to show that the military's role was problematic but that international pressure, especially from the US, complicated things.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by emphasizing the need for nonviolent, constitutional solutions and the US's tarnished image. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear throughout.

Alright, time to put it all together in a coherent summary that stays true to the original article's tone and message.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the cycle of tyranny and coup attempts has led to instability, with President Hugo Chavez and coup-plotting military officers both contributing to the region's democratic challenges. Chavez, who came to power through a coup himself, has abused his mandate by rewriting the constitution and pursuing authoritarian measures, including economic failures and alliances with leftist dictators. His removal from office for two days began when he attempted to control the state oil company, sparking opposition from business, labor, and military factions. The coup ended with international pressure and renewed support for Chavez, highlighting Latin America's move beyond coups. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup tarnished the U.S.'s role as a democracy advocate. The situation underscores the need for constitutional and nonviolent solutions to remove leaders like Chavez, emphasizing the region's democratic progress. END OF SUMMARY.
