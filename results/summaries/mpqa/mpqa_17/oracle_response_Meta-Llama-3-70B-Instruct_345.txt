SUMMARY:

Venezuela's struggle against tyranny has taken a tumultuous turn. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor lie in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at a desire to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil. This sparked a massive protest, joined by business groups and labor unions, with portions of the military on their side. Gunshots fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen, forced Chavez to step aside. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led the generals to reinstate him. The Bush administration's tacit welcome of the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy. It's time for Chavez and the military to show Latin America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end, and for the US to repent.
