SUMMARY:
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, showing tyrannical tactics. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his inclinations to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, sparking pent-up opposition. Business groups and labor unions joined in a giant protest, and military leaders forced Chavez to step aside after gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup tarnishes the US role as a champion of democracy, and it, too, has a reason to repent. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela must use constitutional and nonviolent means to remove Chavez. END OF SUMMARY.
