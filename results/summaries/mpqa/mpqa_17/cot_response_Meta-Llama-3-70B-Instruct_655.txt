SUMMARY:
In Venezuela, the fight against tyranny has turned into tyranny itself. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to suit his interests. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his inclinations to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, sparking pent-up opposition from business groups and labor unions. The military stepped in, forcing Chavez to step aside, but international pressure and renewed domestic support led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit welcome of the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy, and it, too, has reason to repent. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela must find a nonviolent, democratic way to remove Chavez from power. END OF SUMMARY.
