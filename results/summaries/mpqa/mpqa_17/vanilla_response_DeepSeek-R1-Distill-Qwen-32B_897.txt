Alright, the user wants me to summarize a news article about Venezuela. They provided the article and specified that the summary should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also mentioned that I'm a news summarizer assistant.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It talks about Hugo Chavez, a coup, and the political situation in Venezuela. The key points are: Chavez was removed by military officers, there was a coup, but he was reinstated. The article mentions his heavy-handed tactics, rewriting the constitution, economic issues, and his support among the poor. There's also mention of the Bush administration's reaction, which tarnished their image as a democracy champion.

I should identify the main events and themes. The summary needs to capture the coup, the reasons behind it, the reinstatement, and the implications for democracy in Latin America. I should also include the Bush administration's role and its impact.

I need to keep the summary concise, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll start by stating that Chavez was temporarily removed, then explain the reasonsâ€”his authoritarian actions, economic failures, and the coup's catalyst. Then, mention the opposition's role, the violence, military involvement, and international pressure leading to his reinstatement. Finally, touch on the Bush administration's reaction and the broader implications for Latin America.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, covering the sequence of events and the significance of each. Make sure to highlight that the coup showed the region's shift towards nonviolent, constitutional means of change.

I'll structure it as follows:
1. Introduction of Chavez's removal and reinstatement.
2. His authoritarian actions and economic issues.
3. The catalyst (oil company board), opposition's role, violence, and military's part.
4. International pressure and reinstatement.
5. Bush administration's reaction and its implications.
6. Conclusion on the need for nonviolent change in Latin America.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
In Venezuela, a coup temporarily removed President Hugo Chavez, who was later reinstated amid regional and international pressure. Chavez, a former coup leader and elected president, has faced criticism for his authoritarian tactics, including rewriting the constitution and pursuing power beyond his mandate. His economic failures and alignment with leftist dictators have fueled opposition. The coup began when Chavez attempted to control the state oil company, sparking protests and military intervention. Despite violence and loss of life, international pressure and renewed support for Chavez led to his return. The Bush administration's tacit approval of the coup damaged its image as a democracy advocate. The incident highlights Latin America's shift toward constitutional and nonviolent solutions for political change.  
END OF SUMMARY.
