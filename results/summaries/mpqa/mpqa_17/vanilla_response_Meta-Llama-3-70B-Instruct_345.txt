SUMMARY:

Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former army coup leader, has been accused of abusing his power and threatening democracy in Latin America. Chavez's attempts to rewrite the Constitution and consolidate power have led to widespread opposition. When he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, executives revolted, sparking massive protests joined by business groups and labor unions. The military intervened, forcing Chavez to step aside, but international pressure and domestic support led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup has damaged the US's reputation as a champion of democracy.

The article argues that Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means, and that Latin America has moved beyond coups. It urges Chavez and the military to abandon tyrannical tactics and respect democracy.
