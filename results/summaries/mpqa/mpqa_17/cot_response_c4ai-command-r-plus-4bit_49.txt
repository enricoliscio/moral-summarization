SUMMARY:
Venezuela's fight against tyranny took a troubling turn last week, as coup-plotting military officers and President Hugo Chavez resorted to undemocratic measures. Chavez, who came to power through a coup himself, has abused his mandate with heavy-handed tactics, manipulating the Constitution for his own gain and flirting with leftist dictators. His economic promises have fallen flat, and his ambitions for prolonged power are evident. The recent crisis was sparked by Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company, leading to a revolt. A giant protest by business groups and labor unions, coupled with support from portions of the military, culminated in gunshots and the killing of over a dozen people. Chavez was temporarily removed from office by military leaders but reinstated due to international pressure and domestic support. The undemocratic nature of these events, including the US response, tarnishes the hemisphere's reputation as a champion of democracy. Latin America must now demonstrate its commitment to constitutional and nonviolent means of resolving political crises. Chavez and the coup plotters must end their tyrannical tactics, and the Bush administration must repent for its ill-advised support of the coup.
END OF SUMMARY.
