SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny with more tyranny demonstrates the failure of such approaches. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader turned elected official, abused his power with heavy-handed measures based on a constitution tailored to his interests. His economic promises fell short, and his diplomatic ties with dictators revealed his lust for power. The attempted coup against him, sparked by his manipulation of the state-owned oil company, backfired due to international pressure and domestic support for Chavez. The US response, welcoming the coup, tarnished its image as a democracy advocate. Latin America must now show that it has moved beyond coups and can remove leaders through constitutional and nonviolent means. The removal of Chavez, who abused his mandate and threatened democracy, highlights the region's commitment to democratic principles and the rejection of tyrannical tactics. END OF SUMMARY.
