Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words from the article in the summary. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points and the moral perspective.

The article discusses Venezuela's political turmoil, focusing on President Hugo Chavez. It mentions that fighting tyranny with tyranny didn't work, implying that Chavez's methods were tyrannical. The author uses words like "tyranny," "coup-plotting," "abused," and "heavy-handed measures" to describe Chavez's actions. There's also criticism of his economic failures and diplomatic alliances with leftist dictators, using terms like "shreds" and "flirtation."

The article explains how Chavez was removed from office due to protests and military intervention, but he was reinstated after international and domestic pressure. The Bush administration's support for the coup is criticized, using terms like "welcomed" and "tarnishing" the US's image as a democracy champion.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. I should structure the summary to highlight the key events and the moral judgment against Chavez's tactics and the US's role.

I'll start by mentioning the failed attempt to fight tyranny with tyranny in Venezuela. Then, I'll discuss Chavez's heavy-handed measures, his rewritten constitution, and his economic failures. Next, I'll outline the events leading to his removal and reinstatement, emphasizing the opposition's actions and the military's role. Finally, I'll touch on the Bush administration's stance and its impact on their reputation.

I need to ensure that each sentence flows logically and includes the moral terms without making the summary too verbose. I'll also make sure to end with the specified tokens and keep the word count in check.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the attempt to fight tyranny with tyranny has failed, as evidenced by last week's coup and the reinstatement of President Hugo Chavez. Chavez, a former coup leader himself, has abused his popular mandate by implementing heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten by his supporters. His economic promises to the poor have fallen apart, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators highlights his desire to gain more power. The opposition, including business groups and labor unions, joined in protests, knowing that portions of the military were on their side. Gunshots during a march on the presidential palace led to the deaths of more than a dozen people, forcing Chavez to step aside temporarily. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the military to allow him to return to power. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup tarnished the US's role as a champion of democracy, as Latin America has moved beyond coups and now has constitutional means to remove leaders like Chavez. END OF SUMMARY.
