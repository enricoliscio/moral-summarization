Alright, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided an article about Venezuela's political situation, specifically about Hugo Chavez and a coup attempt. They want a summary that keeps the moral terms used by the author, like "tyranny," "coup-plotting," and others.

I should start by reading the article carefully to grasp the main points. The article talks about how Chavez, who came to power through a coup, is now facing another coup attempt. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Chavez's tactics and the coup itself. My job is to condense this into a summary without losing that moral tone.

Next, I'll identify the key events: Chavez's history, the coup, the oil company issue, the protests, the violence, and the international response, especially from the U.S. I need to include all these points concisely.

I also need to make sure to use the morally charged words the author used. For example, instead of just saying "Chavez was removed," I should say "forcibly removed" to keep the negative connotation. Similarly, terms like "abused," "tyrannical," and "coup-plotting" should be included where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: start with Chavez's background, move to the coup, the reasons behind it, the protests, the violence, the reinstatement, and the international reaction. Keeping each sentence tight and focused on the main points without adding extra details.

I also need to watch the word count, aiming for under 200 words. So, I'll have to be concise but comprehensive. Maybe start with the main event, then the context, the causes, the outcome, and the aftermath.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all the key moral terms are included and that the summary accurately reflects the author's framing. I'll make sure it's clear and flows well, avoiding any markdown or formatting as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the cycle of tyranny and coup-plotting persisted as President Hugo Chavez, once a coup instigator himself, faced another attempted overthrow. Chavez, who rewrote the Constitution to consolidate power, has abused his mandate, making veiled threats to extend his rule beyond 2020. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators raises concerns about his power-hungry tactics. The coup began when Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, prompting executives to revolt and threaten an oil cutoff. This catalyzed opposition, with business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military joining protests. Violence erupted, killing over a dozen, forcing Chavez to step aside. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support compelled the military to restore him. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup tarnished the U.S. image as a democracy champion, highlighting the region's need to move beyond coups and adopt constitutional, nonviolent means to address governance issues. END OF SUMMARY.
