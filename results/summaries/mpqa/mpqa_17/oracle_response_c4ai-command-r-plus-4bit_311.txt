SUMMARY: Venezuela's fight against tyranny with more tyranny highlights the failure of such approaches. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader turned elected official, abused his power with heavy-handed measures, manipulating the Constitution for his interests. His economic promises fell flat, while his affinity for leftist dictators raised concerns about his intentions to gain more power. The recent events demonstrate Latin America's rejection of coups as a means of change. The catalyst for the opposition's uprising was Chavez's attempt to control the state-owned oil company, leading to protests and eventually a brief coup. International pressure and domestic support returned Chavez to power, exposing the US administration's questionable stance on democracy. The region now has the opportunity to remove Chavez through constitutional and peaceful means, setting a positive example for the hemisphere. The removal of Chavez, who has abused his mandate and flirts with dictators, is necessary to uphold democratic values in Latin America.
END OF SUMMARY.
