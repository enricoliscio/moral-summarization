Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about Hugo Chavez, his policies, and a recent coup attempt. It mentions how Chavez came to power through a coup himself and then was elected. He's been using heavy-handed measures, rewriting the constitution, and has economic issues. The coup started when he tried to control the oil company, leading to protests and military involvement. The US almost supported the coup, which is problematic because they're supposed to support democracy. 

I should highlight the key events: Chavez's background, his policies, the coup details, and the international reaction, especially from the US. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the coup attempt, mention Chavez's background, the reasons behind the coup, the outcome, and the US's role. Make sure to include that the US's support for the coup was an issue for their democratic stance. 

I'll make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without getting too detailed. Also, end with the note about the US needing to reflect on their actions. That should cover all the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Last week, Venezuela experienced a coup attempt involving military officers and opposition groups, leading to the temporary removal of President Hugo Chavez. Chavez, who previously led a coup himself and was elected three years ago, has been accused of abusing his power through a rewritten constitution and heavy-handed measures. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his alliance with leftist dictators has raised concerns about his power grab. The coup began when Chavez tried to control the state oil company, prompting protests and military intervention. After a violent clash, military leaders forced Chavez to step down, but international pressure and renewed support for him led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's near-support for the coup has tarnished the US's image as a democracy advocate, highlighting the need for reflection on its role in the region. END OF SUMMARY.
