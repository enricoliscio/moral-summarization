SUMMARY:

Venezuela's struggle against tyranny has taken a dark turn as President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures. His tactics, including rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power, have left his economic promises to the poor in shreds. Chavez's flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire to gain more power. When he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil, sparking widespread opposition. A giant protest, joined by business groups and labor unions, forced Chavez to step aside after gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy. Latin America must show that it has moved beyond coups and can remove leaders like Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. END OF SUMMARY.
