Alright, so the user has provided a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The article is about Venezuela's political turmoil, involving Hugo Chavez and a coup attempt. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible from the list they provided.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It talks about Chavez's abuse of power, the coup attempt, the military's role, and the international response, particularly from the Bush administration. The moral framing is evident in words like "tyranny," "coup-plotting," "abused," "shreds," etc.

I should start by identifying the key events: Chavez's heavy-handed measures, the coup attempt, the protests, the violence, and the international reaction. I need to make sure to include the morally framed words where they fit naturally without forcing them.

I should structure the summary to highlight the failure of using tyranny against tyranny, the context of Chavez's rule, the coup's catalyst, the opposition's actions, the violence, the military's role, the reinstatement of Chavez, and the criticism of the Bush administration.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll start by stating the failure of tyranny, then move to Chavez's actions, the coup, the protests, the violence, the military's involvement, the reinstatement, and conclude with the US's tarnished image.

I should double-check that each morally framed word is appropriately used without making the summary sound forced. For example, using "abused" when talking about Chavez's actions, "shreds" for his broken promises, and "tarnishing" for the US's image.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is clear and maintains the moral perspective presented in the original article, making sure it's a coherent and concise overview of the events.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the attempt to combat tyranny with tyranny has failed, as evidenced by last week's coup attempt and the reinstatement of President Hugo Chavez. Chavez, a former coup leader himself, has abused his popular mandate by implementing heavy-handed measures and rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor have fallen into shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators highlights his desire to gain more power. The coup began when Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company, leading to a revolt by executives who threatened to cut off oil supplies. This catalyzed opposition, with business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military joining protests. Violence erupted during a march on the presidential palace, resulting in over a dozen deaths and forcing Chavez to step aside temporarily. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's near-welcoming of the coup tarnished the U.S. image as a democracy champion, leaving room for repentance. END OF SUMMARY.
