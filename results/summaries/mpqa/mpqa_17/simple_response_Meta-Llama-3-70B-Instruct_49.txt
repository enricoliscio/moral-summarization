SUMMARY:

The recent coup attempt in Venezuela has exposed the tyrannical tactics of President Hugo Chavez, who has abused his popular mandate and rewritten the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic flirtations with leftist dictators raise concerns about his desire for more power. The coup began when Chavez tried to manipulate the state-owned oil company, sparking widespread protests from business groups, labor unions, and the military. Although Chavez was initially forced to step aside, international pressure and domestic support led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US's reputation as a champion of democracy. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. It is time for Chavez and the coup-plotters to end their tyrannical tactics and respect democratic principles.
