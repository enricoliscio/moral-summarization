SUMMARY:

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a former army officer, was briefly ousted from power after he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor. The move sparked widespread protests from business groups, labor unions, and portions of the military, leading to Chavez's removal from office. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the generals to reinstate him. The Bush administration's tacit approval of the coup has damaged the US's reputation as a champion of democracy. Chavez's presidency has been marked by authoritarian tendencies, including rewriting the Constitution and making moves to remain in power past 2020. Despite his populist promises, his economic policies have failed to deliver for the poor, and his diplomatic overtures to leftist dictators have raised concerns about his intentions.
