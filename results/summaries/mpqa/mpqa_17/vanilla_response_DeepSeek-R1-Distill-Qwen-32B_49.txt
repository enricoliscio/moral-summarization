Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Venezuela. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with "Veni, Vidi, Venezuela FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work." Hmm, that's a strong opening. It mentions that both the coup-plotters and President Hugo Chavez need to show that their tyrannical tactics are over. 

Chavez is a former Army coup leader who was elected three years ago. He's been using heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he and his supporters rewrote. He even talked about staying president until 2020. His economic promises to the poor aren't holding up, and his diplomatic moves with leftist dictators suggest he wants more power.

The article says Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela, being a key nation in a democratic hemisphere, can remove Chavez constitutionally and nonviolently. The two-day removal started when Chavez tried to control the state oil company. The company's executives rebelled, threatening to stop oil production. This led to protests from business groups and labor unions, who probably knew some military support was on their side.

During a march on the presidential palace, gunshots were fired, killing over a dozen people. Military leaders made Chavez step down. But then international pressure and renewed support for Chavez made the generals let him return. The Bush administration almost supported the coup, which hurt the US's image as a democracy champion. They have reasons to regret that stance.

So, the main points are:
- Chavez's heavy-handed tactics and rewritten constitution.
- His failed economic promises and pursuit of more power.
- The coup attempt led by military and opposition, resulting in his temporary removal.
- The return of Chavez due to international and domestic pressure.
- The Bush administration's partial support of the coup, tarnishing their image.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key events and outcomes, ensuring it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: In Venezuela, the use of tyranny to combat tyranny failed last week, with both coup-plotters and President Hugo Chavez needing to demonstrate an end to such tactics. Chavez, a former coup leader elected three years ago, has abused his mandate through heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution he and his allies rewrote. His economic promises to the poor have collapsed, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators suggest a desire for increased power. The region has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela, as a democratic nation, could remove Chavez via constitutional and nonviolent means. His removal began when he attempted to control the state oil company, sparking opposition from executives, who threatened to halt oil production. This led to protests by business groups and labor unions, supported by military factions. During a march on the presidential palace, gunshots killed over a dozen, prompting military leaders to oust Chavez temporarily. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez compelled the military to restore him. The Bush administration's near-support of the coup damaged the U.S.'s image as a democracy advocate, with reasons to regret its stance. END OF SUMMARY.
