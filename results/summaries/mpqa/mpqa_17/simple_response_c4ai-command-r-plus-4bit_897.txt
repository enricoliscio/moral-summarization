SUMMARY: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, who once led a coup himself, has abused his power and threatened the country's democracy. His undemocratic actions, including attempting to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor and rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power, led to a coup attempt against him. While the coup plot involved members of the military and opposition groups, it was ultimately unsuccessful due to international pressure and domestic support for Chavez. The United States' welcoming response to the coup attempt tarnished its reputation as a champion of democracy. Now, Venezuela must find a way to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means, demonstrating to Latin America and the world that it values democracy and rejects tyranny. Chavez, too, must change his ways and respect the democratic process that brought him to power. The region has moved beyond accepting undemocratic leadership changes, and Venezuela has the opportunity to lead by example in upholding democratic values. END OF SUMMARY.
