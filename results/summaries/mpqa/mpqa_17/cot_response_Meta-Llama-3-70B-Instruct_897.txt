SUMMARY:
In Venezuela, the fight against tyranny has been replaced with tyranny, as President Hugo Chavez and coup-plotting military officers have resorted to tyrannical tactics. Chavez, a former Army coup-meister, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to favor himself and his supporters. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire for more power. Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy, and it too must repent. END OF SUMMARY.
