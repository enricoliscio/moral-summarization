Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Venezuela's political situation, specifically the coup against Hugo Chavez. The author is critical of Chavez's actions, calling them tyrannical, and also points out the US's role in supporting the coup, which tarnishes their image as a democracy champion.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The article mentions Chavez's heavy-handed measures, rewriting the constitution, and his economic failures. It also talks about the opposition using nonviolent means, which is a positive moral stance. The US's support for the coup is seen negatively, so that should be included as a moral failing.

I should structure the summary to highlight the issues with Chavez's governance, the opposition's actions, and the US's involvement. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but include all key points. Let me outline the main points: Chavez's authoritarian tactics, the coup attempt, the opposition's reasons, the military's role, the return of Chavez, and the US's stance.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and maintains the moral critique. I'll start by stating the failure of using tyranny against tyranny, mention Chavez's actions, the coup's catalyst, the opposition's response, the military's involvement, the return of Chavez, and the US's tarnished image. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the political turmoil in Venezuela, highlighting the failure of using "tyranny against tyranny" as a solution. President Hugo Chavez, who came to power through a coup and was later elected, has been accused of abusing his mandate by rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power and making undemocratic moves, such as stacking the board of the state-owned oil company. His economic promises to the poor have not been fulfilled, and his alignment with leftist dictators has raised concerns about his intentions to expand his power. The opposition, including business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military, rose up against him, leading to a coup that temporarily removed him from power. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the military to restore him to office. The article critiques the Bush administration for tacitly supporting the coup, which undermines the U.S. role as a promoter of democracy. The situation underscores the need for Venezuela to transition to constitutional and nonviolent means of resolving political conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
