SUMMARY:
In Venezuela, the fight against tyranny has turned into tyranny itself. President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor are in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his tyrannical inclinations. When Chavez tried to stack the state-owned oil company's board in his favor, executives revolted, sparking a giant protest joined by business groups and labor unions. The military forced Chavez to step aside, but international pressure and renewed domestic support led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US role as a champion of democracy, and it must repent. Venezuela must now show Latin America that tyrannical tactics are at an end, and that democracy can prevail through nonviolent means. END OF SUMMARY.
