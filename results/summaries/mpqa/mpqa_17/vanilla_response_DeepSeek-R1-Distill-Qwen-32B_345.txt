Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Venezuela. Let me read through the article first. It's about Hugo Chavez, a president who was involved in a coup. The article mentions that Venezuela tried fighting tyranny with more tyranny, which didn't work. 

Hmm, I need to capture the main points. Chavez was a former coup leader himself and was elected but has been using heavy-handed tactics. He's been in power for a while and has economic issues, especially with his promises to the poor not being fulfilled. His alliance with leftist dictators is also a point to note.

The article talks about the oil company situation where he tried to stack the board, leading to protests. Business groups and unions joined, and there was a coup attempt. The military forced him out, but then he was reinstated due to international pressure. The US supported the coup, which is problematic for their image as promoters of democracy.

I should structure the summary to include the key events: Chavez's background, his policies, the oil company incident, the coup, and the aftermath with international reactions. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to mention the implications for Latin America and the US's role.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and covers all the main points without getting too detailed. Let me make sure I include the important dates and the outcome of the coup. Also, highlight that Latin America has moved beyond coups and prefers constitutional means.

Alright, putting it all together now. Start with the main event, then background on Chavez, the reasons for the coup, the military's role, and the international response, especially the US. Conclude with the implications for democracy in the region.

SUMMARY: Last week, Venezuela experienced turmoil as coup-plotting military officers briefly removed President Hugo Chavez from power. Chavez, a former coup leader himself and elected three years ago, has been criticized for abusing his mandate through heavy-handed measures, including rewriting the Constitution to consolidate power. His economic promises to the poor have failed, and his alliances with leftist dictators have raised concerns about his authoritarian ambitions. The coup began when Chavez attempted to control the state oil company, leading to protests from business groups, labor unions, and parts of the military. Clashes during a march on the presidential palace resulted in deaths, prompting military leaders to force Chavez's temporary removal. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's tacit support for the coup tarnished the U.S. image as a democracy advocate. The incident highlights the need for Venezuela to move beyond tyranny and embrace constitutional, nonviolent solutions in a region increasingly committed to democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
