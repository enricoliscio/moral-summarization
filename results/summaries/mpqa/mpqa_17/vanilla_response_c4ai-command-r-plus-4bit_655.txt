SUMMARY: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a former Army coup leader, was briefly removed from power last week in a coup led by military officers and supported by business and labor groups. Chavez has abused his power with heavy-handed measures and has hinted at dictatorial inclinations. However, Latin America has moved beyond coups, and Venezuela has the means to remove Chavez through constitutional and nonviolent means. The coup was triggered by Chavez's attempt to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, which led to protests and eventually the military forcing him to step down. International pressure and domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement, and the US response to the coup has tarnished its image as a champion of democracy. Chavez's economic promises to the poor have failed, and his diplomatic ties with leftist dictators further indicate his power-grabbing intentions. Venezuela now needs to demonstrate a commitment to democratic principles and reject tyrannical tactics.
END OF SUMMARY.
