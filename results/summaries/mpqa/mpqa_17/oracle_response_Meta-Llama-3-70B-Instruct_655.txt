SUMMARY:

Venezuela's struggle against tyranny has taken a tumultuous turn. President Hugo Chavez, a former coup-master himself, has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures, rewriting the Constitution to suit his interests. His economic promises to the poor lie in shreds, and his diplomatic flirtation with leftist dictators hints at his desire to gain more power. When Chavez tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor, executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil, sparking widespread opposition. A giant protest ensued, joined by business groups and labor unions, with military leaders eventually forcing Chavez to step aside after gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace, killing over a dozen. However, international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez led to his reinstatement. The Bush administration's welcoming of the coup has tarnished the US's role as a champion of democracy. Latin America must move beyond coups and use constitutional and nonviolent means to remove tyrannical leaders like Chavez. END OF SUMMARY.
