SUMMARY:
Venezuela, a pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies, witnessed a tumultuous attempt to oust President Hugo Chavez from power last week. President Chavez, a former Army coup leader turned elected official, has been accused of tyrannical behavior during his tenure. He abused his mandate with heavy-handed measures and a self-serving rewrite of the Constitution, hinting at his inclinations to retain power beyond his term and past 2020. Chavez's undemocratic tendencies were further evidenced by his economic failures and diplomatic flirtations with leftist world dictators. The final straw came when he attempted to consolidate control over the state-owned oil company, sparking a rebellion. Business and labor groups united in protest, with portions of the military siding against Chavez. The resulting bloodshed led to his temporary removal from office. However, due to international pressure and domestic support, Chavez was reinstated. The US initially welcomed the coup, tarnishing its reputation as a champion of democracy, and now both parties must demonstrate a commitment to constitutional and nonviolent means to resolve their differences. Venezuela has moved beyond coups, and Chavez and the coup-plotting officers must end their tyrannical tactics. There is a reason for both Chavez and the Bush administration to repent for their undemocratic actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
