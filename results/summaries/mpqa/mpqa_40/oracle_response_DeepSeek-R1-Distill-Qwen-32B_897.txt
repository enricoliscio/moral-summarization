Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language employed.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. The key points are that Pakistan is accusing the US report of being factually inaccurate and unwarranted. They mention several initiatives they've taken to promote and protect human rights, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a commission on women's status, police reforms, child labor policies, and citizenship amendments. They also highlight ratifying ILO conventions and introducing joint electorates. Pakistan feels the report misrepresents their efforts and criticizes the US for judging others.

Now, looking at the morally framed words: fails, protect, ignored, amended, enable, remuneration, elimination, labour, respecting, states, misstatement, sit, protecting. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it sound forced.

I should structure the summary to first state Pakistan's rejection of the report, then list their initiatives using the moral words, and conclude with their criticism of the US approach. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring it flows naturally while preserving the moral tone.

I might start with "Pakistan rejects US human rights report, calling it 'factually inaccurate' and 'unwarranted'." Then mention the initiatives they've taken, using words like 'ignored,' 'amended,' 'enable,' 'protecting,' etc. Finally, address their criticism of the US and their commitment to human rights.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each moral word fits naturally into the summary.

SUMMARY:  
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report, according to a Foreign Office spokesman, "fails to acknowledge" Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and child labor policies. Pakistan has also amended its Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor elimination. Despite these measures, the report criticizes Pakistan's human rights record, which the spokesman calls a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasizes its commitment to protecting human rights and urges states to address such issues cooperatively rather than sitting in judgment. END OF SUMMARY.
