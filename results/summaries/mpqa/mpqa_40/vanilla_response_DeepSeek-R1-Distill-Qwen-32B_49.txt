Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. They argue that the report doesn't acknowledge their efforts in promoting human rights. 

I should note the key initiatives Pakistan mentions. They include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a Permanent Commission on Women's Status, police and jail reforms, a policy against child labor, a rehabilitation fund for children, amendments to the Citizenship Act for women, and ratifying ILO conventions. 

The article also mentions Pakistan's introduction of joint electorates respecting minority wishes. Despite these efforts, the US report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as poor, which Pakistan finds unacceptable.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, highlighting Pakistan's rejection, their initiatives, and their criticism of the US report. I'll make sure it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

Let me structure it: start with Pakistan rejecting the report, list the main initiatives, mention the US criticism, and conclude with Pakistan's stance on international cooperation.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that all key points are included without making it too lengthy. Let me draft the summary now.
