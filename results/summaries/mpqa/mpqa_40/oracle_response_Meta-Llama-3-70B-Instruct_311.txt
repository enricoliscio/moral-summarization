SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report "fails" to acknowledge the government's initiatives to "protect" and promote human rights, such as the implementation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman argued that the report "ignored" these developments and instead stated that the government's human rights record remained poor, which is a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan has made efforts to "enable" women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands and has "amended" the Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951. The government remains committed to "protecting" human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries. The spokesman emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better served if states worked together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than "sitting in judgement" over others.
