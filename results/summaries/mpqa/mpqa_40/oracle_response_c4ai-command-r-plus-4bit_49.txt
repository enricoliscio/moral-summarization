SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights in the country, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." Despite Pakistan's recent initiatives to promote and protect human rights, the US report fails to acknowledge these efforts and states that the country's human rights record is poor. The Pakistani government has taken issue with this assessment, citing important policy measures it has implemented, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The Foreign Office spokesman also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children and the introduction of a mass awareness campaign for human rights. Pakistan's commitment to promoting and protecting human rights should be recognized, and the country welcomes assistance from friendly nations in this regard. However, it rejects the US report's assessment and the notion of one state sitting in judgment over another. Pakistan stands firm in its dedication to uphold the values of human rights and dignity for all its citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
