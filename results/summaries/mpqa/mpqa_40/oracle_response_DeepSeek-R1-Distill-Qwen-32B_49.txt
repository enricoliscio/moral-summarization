Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Pakistan is rejecting the US human rights report, calling it inaccurate. They mention several initiatives they've taken, like laws and reforms, to improve human rights. The US report ignored these efforts, so Pakistan feels it's a misstatement.

I need to highlight that the US report "fails" to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts. Pakistan has "protected" and "promoted" human rights through various measures. The report "ignored" their initiatives, which is a "misstatement." I should include words like "amended," "enable," "respecting," and "protecting."

I'll structure the summary to first state Pakistan's rejection, then list their initiatives, and finally address the US report's inaccuracies. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll keep each point concise, focusing on the key moral terms. Also, I'll end with Pakistan's commitment to human rights and their openness to international cooperation.

Okay, I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral language. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and the elimination of child labor. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. Despite these measures, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman deemed a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to promoting human rights and urged international cooperation to address such issues. The government rejected the US report's assessment, stating that it undermines the cause of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
