SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman argued that the report "fails" to acknowledge the government's initiatives to "protect" and promote human rights, including the implementation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman emphasized that the government has "amended" the Pakistan Citizenship Act to "enable" women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Additionally, Pakistan has ratified ILO Conventions on equal "remuneration" and the "elimination" of child "labour." The government feels that the report's assessment is a "misstatement" of facts and that the cause of human rights would be better served if states worked together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than "sitting in judgement" over others.

END OF SUMMARY.
