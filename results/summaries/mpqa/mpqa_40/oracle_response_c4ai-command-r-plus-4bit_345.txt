SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the human rights situation in the country, labeling it as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's important policy measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. The spokesman highlighted several initiatives that were ignored in the US report, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The Pakistani government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Despite these developments, the US report states that the Pakistani government's human rights record remains poor, which the spokesman called a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
