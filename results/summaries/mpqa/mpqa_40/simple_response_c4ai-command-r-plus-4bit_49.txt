SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman vehemently rejected and labeled as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted" the US State Department's report on human rights in Pakistan. The spokesman highlighted several initiatives undertaken by Pakistan to promote and protect human rights, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and ratification of ILO conventions. He argued that the report ignored these significant steps forward and presented an unacceptable and grossly misstated assessment of Pakistan's human rights record. Pakistan expressed its commitment to continuing to uphold human rights and welcomed assistance from friendly nations in this regard. Pakistan's strong rebuttal underscores its stance on national sovereignty and its dedication to improving human rights conditions within its borders.

END OF SUMMARY.
