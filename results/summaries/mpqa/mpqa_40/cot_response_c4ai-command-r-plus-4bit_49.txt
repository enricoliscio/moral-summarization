SUMMARY: 
Pakistan has strongly rejected a US State Department report on the human rights situation in the country, labeling it as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's significant policy measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. He highlighted several important developments that were overlooked in the report, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also emphasized that the government has taken steps to respect the wishes of minority communities and has amended laws to empower women. Despite these improvements, the US report described Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman deemed unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan rejected the assessment and the notion of some states sitting in judgment over others. The spokesman affirmed Pakistan's commitment to human rights, welcoming assistance from friendly countries in this regard.
