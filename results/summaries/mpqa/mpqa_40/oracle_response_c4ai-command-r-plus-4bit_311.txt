SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman rejected a US State Department report on human rights in Pakistan, stating that it fails to acknowledge the government's efforts to promote and protect human rights. The spokesman highlighted several initiatives implemented by Pakistan that were ignored in the US report, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also pointed out that Pakistan has amended its citizenship act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children and has introduced a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record is poor, which the spokesman labeled as a gross misstatement. Pakistan remains committed to protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
