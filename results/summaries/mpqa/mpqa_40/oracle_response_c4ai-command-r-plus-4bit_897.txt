SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights record, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's important policy measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. He highlighted several initiatives that were ignored in the US report, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also noted that the government has amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children and has introduced a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which the spokesman called a gross misstatement. Pakistan rejects the assessment and the notion of some states sitting in judgment over others, emphasizing that cooperation and understanding are needed to address human rights challenges. Pakistan remains committed to upholding human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly nations in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
