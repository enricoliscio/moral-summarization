Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Pakistan's response to the US State Department's human rights report. Pakistan is rejecting the report, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken, like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a Commission on Women's Status, police reforms, and more. They also mention amendments to the Citizenship Act and ratifying ILO conventions. Pakistan feels the US report doesn't acknowledge their efforts and unfairly criticizes their human rights record. They emphasize their commitment to human rights and suggest international cooperation instead of unilateral judgment.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, then mention the key initiatives they've implemented. I'll note that they feel the report is inaccurate and doesn't reflect their progress. Finally, I'll include their call for cooperation and their commitment to human rights.

Let me make sure I cover all main points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it clearly, starting with the rejection, listing the initiatives, their criticism of the report, and their stance on international cooperation.
