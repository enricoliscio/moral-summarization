Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified the morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. The Foreign Office spokesman lists several initiatives Pakistan has taken, like laws for women, child labor, etc. He criticizes the US report for ignoring these efforts and calls the report a misstatement.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of the specified moral words as possible. I should make sure to include words like "fails," "protect," "ignored," "amended," "enable," "remuneration," "elimination," "labour," "respecting," "states," "misstatement," "sit," and "protecting."

I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, highlighting that it's factually inaccurate. Then, mention the initiatives Pakistan has taken, using the specified words where possible. I'll note that the US report ignored these efforts and called it a misstatement. Finally, I'll conclude with Pakistan's commitment to human rights and their request for international cooperation.

I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and measures to eliminate child labor. The report was accused of ignoring Pakistan's progress, such as amending the Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratifying ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The spokesman emphasized that the report's claim of a "poor human rights record" was a gross misstatement, calling it unacceptable. Pakistan stressed its commitment to protecting human rights and urged states to cooperate rather than sit in judgment over others. The government welcomed international assistance in promoting human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
