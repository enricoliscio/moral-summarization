Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "rejected," "factually inaccurate," "unwarranted," "fails," "promote," "protect," "initiatives," "ignored," "implemented," "amended," "citizenship," "awareness," "campaign," "ratified," "signed," "introduced," "wishes," "address," "problems," "cooperation," "understanding," "assistance," "friendly," and "committed." These words are key to the moral argument presented.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should include these moral terms and stay under 200 words. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection of the report, then list the initiatives they've taken to improve human rights. I'll mention the specific laws and policies they've implemented, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the citizenship act amendment. I'll also note their international commitments, like ratifying ILO conventions. Finally, I'll highlight their criticism of the US report and their call for a cooperative approach to human rights.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the summary concise and clear.

**SUMMARY:**  
Pakistan rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The country highlighted its efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and child labor policies. Pakistan also amended its citizenship act to grant nationality to children of Pakistani women married to foreign nationals and ratified international conventions on human rights. Despite these measures, the report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government deemed a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to addressing human rights issues through cooperation and urged a collaborative approach rather than external judgment.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
