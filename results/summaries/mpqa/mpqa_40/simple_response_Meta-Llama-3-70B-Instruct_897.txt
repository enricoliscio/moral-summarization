SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman argued that the report failed to acknowledge the government's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of various initiatives such as police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman pointed out that Pakistan has also ratified several international conventions and protocols on human rights, including those on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The government has expressed its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and has called for cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The moral framing of the article suggests that the US report's negative assessment of Pakistan's human rights record is unfair and that Pakistan is being unfairly judged, highlighting the importance of cooperation and mutual respect in promoting human rights.
