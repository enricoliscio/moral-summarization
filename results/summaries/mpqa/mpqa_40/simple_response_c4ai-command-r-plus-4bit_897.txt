SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights in Pakistan, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report ignored important policy measures and initiatives implemented by the Pakistani government to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act to allow Pakistani women to pass on their nationality to their children, and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority communities. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor. The Pakistani government has rejected this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts, emphasizing its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights with the assistance of friendly countries.
