SUMMARY:
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report fails to acknowledge the government's "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of various reforms and the ratification of international conventions. The government feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment, which it deems "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of facts." Instead, Pakistan calls for international cooperation and understanding to address human rights issues, and remains "committed" to promoting and protecting human rights with the assistance of "friendly" countries. The government's stance emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and cooperation in advancing the cause of human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
