Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. They provided the article, so I need to read through it carefully to extract the key points.

First, I notice that Pakistan is criticizing the US State Department's report, calling it inaccurate. The Foreign Office spokesman mentions that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights. I should note the specific initiatives they've taken, like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the women's commission, police reforms, and child labor policies.

Also, Pakistan has amended its citizenship act to help women get nationality for their children. They've ratified some ILO conventions and introduced joint electorates. The US report, however, says their human rights record is poor, which Pakistan strongly disagrees with.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these points without getting too detailed. I should structure it to first state Pakistan's rejection, then list their initiatives, and finally address the US report's criticism and Pakistan's stance against it.

I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection, then outline the measures they've taken, and conclude with their criticism of the US report. That should cover all necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and reforms in police, jails, and child labor policies. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship act to allow women to claim nationality for their children, ratified ILO conventions on child labor and equal remuneration, and introduced joint electorates for minority communities. Despite these measures, the report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government called a "gross misstatement." Pakistan urged a cooperative approach to addressing human rights issues and emphasized its commitment to protecting human rights while welcoming international assistance. END OF SUMMARY.
