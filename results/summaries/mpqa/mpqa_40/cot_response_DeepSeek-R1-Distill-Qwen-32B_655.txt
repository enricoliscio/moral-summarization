Okay, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They have given a news article about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. The task is to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. The user wants two steps: Step 1 is to list all the morally framed words, each on a new line with an asterisk. Step 2 is to write a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, I'll start by reading through it to identify the morally charged terms. Words like "rejected," "factually inaccurate," "unwarranted," "fails to acknowledge," "important policy measures," "promote," "protect," "initiatives," "ignored," "implementation," "failed," "reforms," "elimination," "mass awareness campaign," "Year of Human Rights and Human Dignity," "ratified," "Convention," "Optional Protocols," "joint electorates," "constraints," "reject," "assessment," "misstatement," "cause," "cooperation," "understanding," "problems," "promoting," "protecting," "commitment," "welcome," "assistance," "friendly countries."

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should be under 200 words and include as many of these moral terms as possible. The key points are Pakistan rejecting the US report, listing their human rights initiatives, and arguing against the report's inaccuracies.

I'll structure the summary by stating Pakistan's rejection, the reasons given by the Foreign Office spokesman, the initiatives they've taken, and their call for cooperation. I'll make sure to include the moral terms to preserve the author's framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the identified words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token as instructed.

### SUMMARY:  
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and child labor elimination policies. Pakistan also amended the Citizenship Act to grant nationality rights to children of Pakistani women married to foreign nationals and ratified key international conventions on human rights. The spokesman accused the report of misstating facts and called for global cooperation to address human rights challenges. Pakistan remains committed to protecting human rights and welcomes international assistance in this effort.  
END OF SUMMARY.
