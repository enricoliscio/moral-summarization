SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Pakistan, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman argued that the report failed to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of various initiatives such as police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman pointed out that Pakistan has ratified several international conventions and protocols, including those on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. Despite these developments, the report claimed that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the spokesman deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan urged that all states should work together to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The government reaffirmed its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomed assistance from friendly countries.
