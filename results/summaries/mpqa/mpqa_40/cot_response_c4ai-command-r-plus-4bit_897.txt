SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights in the country, labeling it as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Pakistani government asserts that the report fails to acknowledge their important initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, establishment of commissions and reforms, and national policies for the elimination of child labor. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship laws to empower women, launched awareness campaigns, ratified international conventions, and signed protocols to protect children's rights. Despite these developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record "remained poor." Pakistan rejects this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. They criticize the tendency of some states to pass judgement on others and assert that cooperation and understanding are needed to address human rights challenges. Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights while welcoming assistance from friendly nations in this regard.
