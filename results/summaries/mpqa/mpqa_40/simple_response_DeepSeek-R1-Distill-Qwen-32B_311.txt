Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Pakistan is criticizing the US report as inaccurate and not acknowledging their efforts in human rights. They list several initiatives like laws for children, women's rights, labor reforms, and international conventions they've ratified.

I should highlight Pakistan's rejection and the reasons they provided. It's important to mention the specific measures they've taken to show their commitment to human rights. Also, the moral stance is that Pakistan feels the report is unfair and that international cooperation should be based on mutual respect.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures Pakistan's perspective and their efforts. I'll structure it by stating the rejection, listing key initiatives, and their argument against the report's unfairness.

Let me make sure I include all the main points without going into too much detail. I'll also end with their commitment to human rights and the call for cooperation.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and measures to combat child labor. The government has also amended laws to allow women of Pakistani descent to claim nationality for their children and ratified international conventions on human rights. Despite these developments, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman described as a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights and urged international cooperation, rather than unilateral judgment, to address such issues. The government welcomed assistance from friendly countries to further its human rights agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
