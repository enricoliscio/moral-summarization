SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman highlighted additional measures taken by Pakistan, such as amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act to grant nationality to children of Pakistani women married to foreigners, ratifying ILO conventions, and introducing a joint electorate system respecting minority communities. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts, emphasizing its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights with the assistance of friendly countries.
