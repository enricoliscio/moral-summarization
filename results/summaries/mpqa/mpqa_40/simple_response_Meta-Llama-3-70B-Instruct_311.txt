SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Pakistan, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman argued that the report failed to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives taken by the Pakistani government to promote and protect human rights. The government has implemented various reforms, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. Additionally, Pakistan has ratified several international conventions on human rights and has launched awareness campaigns. The spokesman condemned the report's negative assessment of Pakistan's human rights record, calling it "unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts." Instead, Pakistan advocates for a cooperative approach to promoting and protecting human rights, where countries work together to address their respective challenges.
