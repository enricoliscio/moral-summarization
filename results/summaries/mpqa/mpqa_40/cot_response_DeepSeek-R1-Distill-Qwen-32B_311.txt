Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, they want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Then, I need to write a summary preserving those moral terms. 

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "rejected," "factually inaccurate," "unwarranted," "promote," "protect," "initiatives," "important," "fails," "acknowledge," "policy," "ignored," "implementation," "amended," "citizenship," "mass awareness," "ratified," "signed," "convention," "commitment," "rejected," "unacceptable," "gross misstatement," "constrained," "reject," "assessment," "tendency," "judge," "cooperation," "understanding," "address," "problems," "promote," "protect," "remain committed," "welcome," "assistance." These words seem to carry the moral framing the user is asking for.

Next, I need to write a concise summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and include the key points: Pakistan rejecting the US report, listing their initiatives, and emphasizing their commitment to human rights despite the criticism.

I should structure the summary to first state Pakistan's rejection, then outline their efforts, and conclude with their stance on international cooperation. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the original tone.

Let me draft the summary: Pakistan rejected the US human rights report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. They highlighted their efforts like legal reforms, women's rights, child labor policies, and international agreements. Despite these, the report criticized their record, which Pakistan found unacceptable. They stressed their commitment to human rights and urged a cooperative approach among nations.

I think that covers all the points and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll make sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

**SUMMARY:**  
Pakistan rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman highlighted Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including legal reforms, women's rights initiatives, and measures to eliminate child labor. Despite these developments, the report criticized Pakistan's human rights record, which the government deemed unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights and urged international cooperation to address challenges. The government rejected the tendency of some states to judge others, stressing that the cause of human rights would be better served through collaborative efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
