SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights record, calling it factually inaccurate and an unwarranted judgement. A Foreign Office spokesman listed several important policy measures and initiatives by the Pakistani government to promote and protect human rights that were overlooked in the US report. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of key international conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labour. The spokesman also highlighted steps taken to address the concerns of minority communities and to enable women to pass on their nationality to their children. Despite these developments and Pakistan's commitment to improving human rights, the US report unfairly characterized the government's human rights record as poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment and the notion that some states can sit in judgement over others. The spokesman affirmed that Pakistan remains dedicated to upholding human rights and would welcome cooperation and assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
