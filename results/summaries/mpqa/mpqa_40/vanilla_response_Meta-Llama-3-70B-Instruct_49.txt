SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of policies such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions. The spokesman argued that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" is unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan has made significant progress in promoting and protecting human rights, including the introduction of joint electorates respecting minority communities' wishes. The government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries.

END OF SUMMARY.
