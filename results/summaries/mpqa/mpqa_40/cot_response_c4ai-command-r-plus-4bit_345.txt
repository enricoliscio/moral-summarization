SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman has strongly criticized the US State Department's human rights report on Pakistan, labeling it as "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." Pakistan rejects the report's assessment of its human rights record, stating that it fails to acknowledge the government's important initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives include the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also highlights the implementation of almost all the initiatives announced at the April 2000 human rights conference, such as the national policy and Plan of Action for the elimination of child labor and the establishment of a fund for the rehabilitation of working children. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship act to empower women, launched awareness campaigns, and introduced joint electorates respecting minority communities. Despite these positive developments, the US report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which Pakistan considers unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan rejects the judgmental tendency of some states and believes that cooperation and understanding are needed to address human rights challenges. Pakistan remains committed to protecting and promoting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
