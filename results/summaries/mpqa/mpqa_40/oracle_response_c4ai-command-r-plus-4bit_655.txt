SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights record as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. A Foreign Office spokesman said the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's important policy measures and initiatives to promote and protect human rights. He stated that the report ignored key developments, such as the implementation of almost all initiatives announced at a 2000 human rights conference, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labour. The spokesman also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority wishes. Despite these advancements, the report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, which the spokesman called a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
