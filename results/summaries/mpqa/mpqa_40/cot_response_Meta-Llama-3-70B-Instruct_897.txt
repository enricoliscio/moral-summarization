SUMMARY:
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of various reforms and ratification of international conventions. Despite these developments, the report claims Pakistan's human rights record remains "poor," which is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment and instead advocates for a spirit of "cooperation and understanding" among states to address human rights issues. The government remains "committed" to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from "friendly" countries. END OF SUMMARY.
