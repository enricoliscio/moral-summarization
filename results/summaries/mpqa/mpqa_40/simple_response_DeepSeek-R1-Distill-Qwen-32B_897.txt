Alright, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. The key points are that Pakistan claims the report is inaccurate and ignores their efforts. They list several initiatives like legal reforms, women's rights, child labor laws, and international conventions they've ratified. Pakistan is emphasizing their commitment to human rights and cooperation.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements: Pakistan's rejection, the initiatives they've taken, and their call for international cooperation. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral stance presented in the article.

Let me structure it: start with Pakistan rejecting the report, mention the initiatives, then their criticism of the report's assessment, and end with their commitment to human rights and desire for cooperation.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. Also, ensure the summary flows well and is clear. Let me check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.
