Okay, so I need to summarize this news article where Pakistan is rejecting a US human rights report. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Pakistan has rejected the US report, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman mentions that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights. They list several initiatives, like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the Women's Commission, police reforms, child labor policies, and citizenship amendments. They also mention ratifying international conventions and introducing joint electorates for minorities.

The key moral points here are Pakistan's frustration with being judged by another country, especially when they feel they've made significant strides. The spokesman emphasizes that the US report is unfair and doesn't reflect their progress. The moral framing is about sovereignty and the right of Pakistan to address its own human rights issues without external criticism, while also highlighting their proactive measures.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Pakistan's rejection, then list the main initiatives they've taken, and conclude with their criticism of the US report and their commitment to human rights. I should make sure to include the moral stance about sovereignty and cooperation.

Let me structure it: mention the rejection, list the initiatives briefly, note the US report's negative assessment, Pakistan's criticism, and their commitment. Keep it concise but cover all main points. I should avoid any markdown and just write a straightforward summary.

I think that's the approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing accurately.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote human rights, including initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and ratification of international conventions on child labor and women's rights. The government has also amended citizenship laws to allow women to pass nationality to their children and introduced joint electorates for minority communities. Despite these measures, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman deemed unacceptable. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights and urged international cooperation rather than external judgment. The country rejected the report's assessment, asserting its sovereignty and the need for a collaborative approach to addressing human rights challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
