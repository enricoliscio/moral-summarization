SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report "fails" to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, such as the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and police and jail reforms. The spokesman argued that the report "ignored" the implementation of initiatives announced at a 2000 human rights conference, including the promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the national policy to eliminate child labor. The government has also "amended" the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. The spokesman condemned the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," calling it a "misstatement of facts." The government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome assistance from friendly countries towards that end.
