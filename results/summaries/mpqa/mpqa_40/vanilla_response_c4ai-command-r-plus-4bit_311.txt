SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights record, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge the Pakistani government's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives announced in 2000, such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The spokesman highlighted additional measures taken by Pakistan to uphold human rights, such as amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act, ratifying ILO conventions, and introducing a joint electorate system. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan's government rejected this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. They emphasized their commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomed assistance from friendly countries in this regard. Pakistan also criticized the tendency of some states to judge others, suggesting that cooperation and understanding are better approaches to addressing human rights concerns.
