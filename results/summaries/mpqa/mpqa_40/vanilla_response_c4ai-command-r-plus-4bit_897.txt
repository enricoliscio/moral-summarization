SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on human rights in the country, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report fails to acknowledge the Pakistani government's efforts to promote and protect human rights and listed several initiatives taken by the government, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and ratification of ILO conventions. The spokesman also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act and the introduction of joint electorates to respect minority communities' wishes. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan rejected this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts, emphasizing its commitment to human rights and willingness to accept assistance from friendly countries.

END OF SUMMARY.
