SUMMARY:
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report fails to acknowledge the country's "important policy measures and initiatives" to promote and protect human rights. Pakistan has implemented various initiatives, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and a national policy to eliminate child labor. The government has also ratified several international conventions and launched a mass awareness campaign. Despite these developments, the report states that Pakistan's human rights record remains poor, which is deemed "unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan feels "constrained to reject" the report's assessment and instead advocates for a spirit of "cooperation and understanding" to address human rights issues. The government remains "committed" to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries.
