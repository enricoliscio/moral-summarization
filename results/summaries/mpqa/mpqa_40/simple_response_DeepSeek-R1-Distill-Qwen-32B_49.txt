Okay, so I need to summarize this news article where Pakistan is rejecting a US human rights report. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the original text is pretty detailed, so I should focus on the key points without getting too bogged down in specifics.

First, the main point is that Pakistan is rejecting the US report, calling it factually inaccurate. They're upset because the report doesn't acknowledge their efforts in human rights. I should highlight the initiatives they mention, like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the women's commission, police reforms, child labor policies, and citizenship amendments. These are all positive steps Pakistan has taken.

I also need to mention their international commitments, like ratifying ILO conventions and signing optional protocols. Plus, they introduced joint electorates for minorities. All these show Pakistan's commitment, which the US report ignored.

The US report's criticism is seen as unacceptable by Pakistan, so they're rejecting it and calling for cooperation instead of unilateral judgments. I should make sure to convey that Pakistan feels the report is unfair and that they're open to help from friendly countries.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all the main points. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to first state Pakistan's rejection, then list their initiatives, mention their international actions, and conclude with their stance on the report and their openness to assistance.

Let me make sure I'm not missing any crucial details. They mentioned several specific laws and reforms, so I should include those to show their efforts. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”Pakistan is highlighting their proactive steps to improve human rights, which the US report overlooked. This shows their frustration with external criticism without acknowledging their progress.

I think that's a solid approach. I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and captures all the key elements while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police reforms, and measures to combat child labor. Pakistan also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to allow women to claim nationality for their children born to foreign husbands and ratified international labor conventions. Despite these steps, the report accused Pakistan of having a poor human rights record, which the government called a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights and called for global cooperation to address such issues, rejecting external judgment. The government welcomed assistance from friendly countries to further its human rights agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
