SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The government claims the report fails to acknowledge its efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of various initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions. The government argues that the report's assessment of its human rights record as "poor" is unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Instead, Pakistan suggests that countries should work together to address human rights issues, rather than judging each other. The government reaffirms its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries.

END OF SUMMARY.
