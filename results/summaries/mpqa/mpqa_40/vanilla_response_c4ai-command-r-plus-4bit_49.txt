SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman rejected a US State Department report on human rights in Pakistan, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The spokesman stated that the report failed to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives announced at a 2000 human rights conference. These initiatives included the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. The spokesman also highlighted amendments to the Pakistan Citizenship Act to allow Pakistani women to pass on their nationality to children born to foreign husbands, and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority communities. Despite these developments, the US report stated that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor. Pakistan's government rejected this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts, emphasizing its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. Pakistan also expressed its willingness to accept assistance from friendly countries in this regard. END OF SUMMARY.
