SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights in Pakistan, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report, according to Pakistan, fails to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. The government has also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Despite these efforts, the report states that the government's human rights record remained poor, which Pakistan considers a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan feels that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states worked together in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than sitting in judgment over others. The government remains committed to protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries.
