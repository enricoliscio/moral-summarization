SUMMARY: Pakistan has slammed a US State Department report on the country's human rights record as factually inaccurate and an unwarranted judgement. A Foreign Office spokesman stated that the report failed to recognize Pakistan's significant policy measures and initiatives to uphold human rights. He highlighted several key actions taken by Pakistan, including reforms in the justice system, police, and jails, as well as the ratification of ILO conventions and the signing of Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Despite these advancements, the US report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as poor. Pakistan rejects this assessment as unacceptable and a gross misrepresentation of the facts. The spokesman emphasized Pakistan's commitment to promoting and protecting human rights while also respecting the wishes of minority communities. Pakistan is open to assistance from friendly countries in further improving human rights, but it rejects the idea of some states sitting in judgment over others. Pakistan's stance highlights the sensitive nature of human rights evaluations, where cultural and political differences must be navigated with cooperation and understanding.
