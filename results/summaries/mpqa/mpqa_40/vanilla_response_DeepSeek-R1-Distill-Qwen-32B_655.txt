Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Pakistan rejecting the US human rights report. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report, calling it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman mentions that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights. They list several initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the Commission on Women's Status, police reforms, child labor policies, and a citizenship act amendment. They also ratified ILO conventions and introduced joint electorates for minorities. The spokesman criticizes the US report for stating Pakistan's human rights record is poor, calling it a misstatement. They argue that cooperation among states is better for addressing human rights issues.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should include Pakistan's rejection of the report, the main initiatives they've taken, and their criticism of the US report. I'll make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me structure it: Start with Pakistan rejecting the report, list the initiatives briefly, mention the US report's criticism, and conclude with Pakistan's stance on cooperation. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Let me put it together in a coherent way, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.
