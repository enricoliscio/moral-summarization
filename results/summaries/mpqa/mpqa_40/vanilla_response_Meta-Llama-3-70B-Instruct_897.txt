SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report failed to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of several reforms and policies. These initiatives include the establishment of a commission on women's status, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of international conventions on child labor and equal remuneration. The spokesman argued that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" was unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and is open to assistance from friendly countries. The government has urged all states to work together to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another.
