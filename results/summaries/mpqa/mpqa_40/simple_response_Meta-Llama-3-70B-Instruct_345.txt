SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman argued that the report fails to acknowledge the significant policy measures and initiatives taken by the Pakistani government to promote and protect human rights. The government has implemented various reforms, including the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. Pakistan has also ratified international conventions on equal remuneration and child labor, and introduced a system of joint electorates respecting minority communities' wishes. The spokesman deemed the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" to be "unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries, emphasizing the need for cooperation and understanding among states.
