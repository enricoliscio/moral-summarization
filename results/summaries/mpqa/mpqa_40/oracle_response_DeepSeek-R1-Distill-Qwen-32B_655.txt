Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about Pakistan rejecting a US human rights report. The key points are that Pakistan claims the report is inaccurate and doesn't acknowledge their efforts. They mention several initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System, Women's Commission, police reforms, child labor policies, and citizenship amendments. The US report is criticized for ignoring these efforts, leading Pakistan to reject it as a misstatement. They emphasize their commitment to human rights and cooperation with friendly countries.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author: fails, protect, ignored, amended, enable, remuneration, elimination, labour, respecting, states, misstatement, sit, protecting. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to first state Pakistan's rejection, then list the initiatives they've taken, and finally address their criticism of the US report. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to maintain the author's framing. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all essential points.

I should start with Pakistan rejecting the report, mention the spokesman's points about the initiatives, and then the criticism of the report's assessment. Finally, conclude with Pakistan's commitment to human rights and their stance against external judgment.

Let me draft this, ensuring I include all the key initiatives and moral terms without making it too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. That should cover the main points and preserve the moral framing as required.

SUMMARY:  
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for failing to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts to protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police reforms, and a national plan to eliminate child labor. The government also amended the Pakistan Citizenship Act to enable women to claim nationality for their children and ratified ILO conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. Despite these measures, the report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman deemed a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan emphasized its commitment to protecting human rights and urged states to cooperate rather than judge others. The government rejected the report's assessment, asserting that its efforts to promote human rights should not be overlooked. END OF SUMMARY.
