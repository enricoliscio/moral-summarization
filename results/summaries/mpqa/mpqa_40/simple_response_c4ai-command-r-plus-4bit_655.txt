SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected a US State Department report on the country's human rights record, labeling it as factually inaccurate and an unwarranted judgment. Despite Pakistan's efforts to improve human rights, the US report states that the country's human rights record remains poor. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman countered this assessment by listing several important policy measures and initiatives undertaken by the government to promote and protect human rights. These include the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, ratification of ILO conventions, and the introduction of a joint electorate system respecting minority communities. The spokesman argued that the US report ignored these developments and failed to acknowledge Pakistan's commitment to improving human rights. Pakistan expressed its commitment to continuing to promote and protect the human rights of its citizens and welcomed assistance from friendly countries in this regard. Pakistan's rejection of the US report highlights the complex and sensitive nature of international assessments of human rights, suggesting that cooperation and mutual understanding between states may be a more effective approach to addressing human rights concerns.
