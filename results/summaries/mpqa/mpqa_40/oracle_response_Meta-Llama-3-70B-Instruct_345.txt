SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report, according to Pakistan, "fails" to acknowledge the government's efforts to "protect" and promote human rights, including the implementation of initiatives announced at a 2000 human rights conference. These initiatives include the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the elimination of child labor. Pakistan has also "amended" its citizenship act to "enable" women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. The government has also "respected" the wishes of minority communities by introducing a system of joint electorates. Pakistan views the report's assessment as a "misstatement" of facts and urges states to work together to "protect" human rights, rather than "sitting" in judgment over others. The government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries.
