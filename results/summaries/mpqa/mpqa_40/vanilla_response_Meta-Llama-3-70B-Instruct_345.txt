SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report failed to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions. The spokesman argued that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" was unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries. The government rejects the report's assessment and the tendency of some states to judge others, instead advocating for cooperation and understanding to address human rights issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
