SUMMARY: Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman has rejected the US State Department's human rights report on Pakistan, deeming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." Pakistan's government took issue with the report's failure to acknowledge their important initiatives to promote and protect human rights. These initiatives included the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police and jail reforms, national policy and action for the elimination of child labor, and the establishment of a fund for rehabilitating working children. The spokesman highlighted additional measures taken by Pakistan, such as amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act to empower women, ratifying ILO conventions, signing optional protocols, and introducing a joint electorate system respecting minority communities. Despite these advancements, the US report labeled Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the spokesman deemed unacceptable and a gross misstatement. Pakistan rejects this assessment and the notion of some states sitting in judgment over others. The spokesman emphasized that the cause of human rights would be better served by addressing shared challenges in a spirit of cooperation and understanding. Pakistan remains committed to upholding human rights and welcomes support from friendly nations in this endeavor. END OF SUMMARY.
