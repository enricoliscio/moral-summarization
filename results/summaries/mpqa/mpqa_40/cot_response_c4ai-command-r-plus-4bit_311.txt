SUMMARY: Pakistan has strongly criticized a US State Department report on the human rights situation in the country, deeming it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Pakistani government rejects the report's assessment of its human rights record as 'poor', stating that it ignores the important initiatives and policy measures undertaken to promote and protect human rights. These include the implementation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO conventions on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. Pakistan also highlights its amended citizenship act, which enables women to pass on their nationality to their children, and its commitment to minority communities. Pakistan considers the report's negative evaluation of its human rights situation unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. The government expresses its commitment to upholding human rights and is willing to engage with friendly nations to further this cause. Pakistan also highlights the cooperative and understanding spirit of addressing human rights issues. END OF SUMMARY.
