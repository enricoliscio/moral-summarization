SUMMARY:
Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on human rights, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report fails to acknowledge the country's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including the implementation of initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance and police and jail reforms. Pakistan has also ratified several international conventions on human rights, including those on equal remuneration and the elimination of child labor. Despite these developments, the report claims that Pakistan's human rights record remains "poor," which is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan feels "constrained" to reject the report's assessment and instead calls for cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights issues. The government remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from "friendly" countries. END OF SUMMARY.
