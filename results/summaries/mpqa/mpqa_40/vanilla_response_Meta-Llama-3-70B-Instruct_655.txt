SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report failed to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, including the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The spokesman argued that the report's assessment of Pakistan's human rights record as "poor" was unacceptable and a gross misstatement of facts. Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries. The government has introduced several reforms, including the introduction of joint electorates, respecting the wishes of minority communities. Pakistan urges all states to address human rights issues in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, rather than judging others.
