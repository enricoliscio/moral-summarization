Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Pakistan rejecting the US human rights report. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article states that Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report, calling it inaccurate and unwarranted. The Foreign Office spokesman mentions that the report doesn't acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in promoting human rights. They list several initiatives like the Juvenile Justice System, women's commission, police reforms, and child labor policies. Pakistan also amended citizenship laws and ratified international conventions. Despite these, the US report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as poor, which Pakistan strongly disagrees with.

I should highlight Pakistan's rejection, the reasons given, the specific initiatives they've taken, and their criticism of the US report. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

Let me outline the key points: Pakistan rejects the report, lists their human rights initiatives, criticizes the report's assessment, and emphasizes their commitment to human rights while seeking international cooperation.

Now, I'll craft a summary that includes all these elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's human rights report, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the report for ignoring Pakistan's efforts to promote and protect human rights, including initiatives such as the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, police reforms, and the establishment of a fund for working children. Pakistan has also amended its citizenship act to allow women to pass nationality to their children, ratified ILO conventions on child labor and equal remuneration, and introduced joint electorates for minority communities. Despite these measures, the report criticized Pakistan's human rights record as "poor," which the government deemed unacceptable. Pakistan emphasized its commitment to human rights and called for international cooperation to address such issues. END OF SUMMARY.
