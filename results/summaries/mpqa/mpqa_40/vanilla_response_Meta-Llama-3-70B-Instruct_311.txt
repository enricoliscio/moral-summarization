SUMMARY:

Pakistan has rejected the US State Department's report on the country's human rights situation, calling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The Foreign Office spokesman claimed that the report failed to acknowledge the government's initiatives and policy measures to promote and protect human rights. The government highlighted several achievements, including the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, police and jail reforms, and the ratification of ILO Conventions on equal remuneration and child labor. The spokesman expressed disappointment that the report still concluded that Pakistan's human rights record remained poor, calling it a "gross misstatement of facts." Pakistan urged cooperation and understanding among states to address human rights issues, rather than judging one another. The government reaffirmed its commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomed assistance from friendly countries.
