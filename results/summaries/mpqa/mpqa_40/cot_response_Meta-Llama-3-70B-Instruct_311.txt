SUMMARY:
Pakistan rejects the US State Department's country report on human rights, labeling it "factually inaccurate and unwarranted." The report fails to acknowledge the government's initiatives to promote and protect human rights, such as the establishment of a Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and police and jail reforms. Despite these developments, the report states that the government's human rights record remained "poor", which is deemed "unacceptable" and a "gross misstatement of facts". Pakistan feels "constrained" to reject the assessment, emphasizing that the cause of human rights would be better served if all states address their problems in a spirit of "cooperation" and "understanding". The government remains "committed" to promoting and protecting human rights and welcomes assistance from friendly countries towards that end. END OF SUMMARY.
