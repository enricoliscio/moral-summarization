SUMMARY: In recent weeks, there have been significant developments in the fight against climate change on both sides of the Atlantic. While the European Union is taking decisive action by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has withdrawn from its commitment to this important multilateral agreement. The US withdrawal has not deterred the global community from strengthening the Kyoto Protocol, and the EU has played a dominant role in these negotiations. However, it is warned that global climate protection efforts will fall short without comparable action from the United States.

The US climate protection program falls far short of expectations, and President Bush's announcement recognizes the need to fight climate change but lacks ambition. The program targets an 18% reduction in emissions intensity, which is weak given expected productivity levels. The US economy's growth will offset any gains in energy efficiency, resulting in a 24.5% increase in absolute emissions by 2012 compared to 1990 levels. This is in stark contrast to the Kyoto Protocol's requirements for emission reductions of 8%, 6%, and 7% for the EU, Japan, and the US, respectively.

Climate experts have warned of the dramatic consequences of failing to act rapidly and decisively. To maintain climate change at an acceptable level, industrialized countries must reduce emissions by around 70% by 2020. Without coordinated international action, the average global temperature will rise by 5.8Â°C by 2100, sea levels will increase by up to 90 cm, and hurricanes will become more frequent and severe. 

The EU environment ministers have called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change and strengthen its domestic actions to align with the efforts of industrial countries. The US cannot be relieved of its responsibilities, and the door remains open for their return to the Kyoto process.
