Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words from the article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about recent developments in climate policy on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big step for climate protection. The US, on the other hand, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol under President Bush, which almost collapsed international negotiations. Now, the US has a climate protection program, but it's not as strong as Europe's.

The author uses words like "withdrew," "withdrawal," "warnings," and "unheeded" to emphasize the US's lack of commitment. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The article also mentions the consequences of not taking action, like rising temperatures and sea levels, so I should highlight the urgency with words like "rapid" and "decisive."

I should structure the summary to first mention Europe's actions, then the US's withdrawal and weak program. I'll include the call for the US to assume responsibility and strengthen their efforts. Also, the economic benefits for Europe from their climate policies should be noted, along with the hope that the US will join in.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points are covered. Let me start drafting, making sure to incorporate the moral language effectively.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has reached a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by 1 June, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. Meanwhile, the United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has unveiled a climate protection program that falls far short of expectations. President Bush's program, which aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, is widely seen as inadequate. The US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, described as "fundamentally flawed" by Bush, has not halted international efforts, with the EU playing a dominant role in shaping the agreement. The US program fails to meet the warnings of climate experts, who have called for rapid and decisive action to avert the most serious consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities and strengthen its efforts to align with the Kyoto Protocol. The article highlights the moral imperative for the US to return to the Kyoto process, emphasizing that the world cannot effectively combat climate change without US commitment. The EU's leadership in climate protection is also seen as economically beneficial, creating jobs and driving innovation in clean technologies. END OF SUMMARY.
