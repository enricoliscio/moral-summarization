SUMMARY:

The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with the council of environment ministers agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls short of expectations, with a goal of reducing emissions by only 18% between 2002 and 2012. This is far from the 7% reduction required by the Kyoto Protocol and the 70% reduction needed by 2020 to prevent catastrophic climate change. The EU has taken a dominant role in international negotiations, and its commitment to climate protection has economic benefits, including the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs. The US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol is a setback, but the door remains open for its return. It is morally imperative for the US to assume its responsibilities and take decisive action to combat climate change.
