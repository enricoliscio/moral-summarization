Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, the EU environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June, aiming for it to take effect before the Johannesburg summit. The US, on the other hand, under President Bush, pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, calling it flawed. Their new program aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP by 18% over 10 years, which isn't as ambitious as Kyoto's targets.

I should note that the EU played a key role in keeping the Kyoto Protocol alive after the US withdrawal. The Bonn and Marrakech conferences helped formalize the agreement. However, without US participation, the effectiveness is questioned.

The US program's weakness is highlighted because it doesn't meet the Kyoto targets. Even with efficiency gains, emissions are expected to rise due to economic growth. The article mentions the IPCC's warnings about the need for drastic action to prevent severe climate impacts.

It also points out the economic benefits for Europe in leading on climate policies, creating jobs and fostering new technologies. The hope is that the US will rejoin the Kyoto process, as their participation is crucial.

So, the summary should cover these points: EU's ratification, US withdrawal and weak program, the importance of US participation, and the economic benefits of climate policies for Europe.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June, aiming for its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. In contrast, the US, under President Bush, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, calling it flawed, and introduced a less ambitious climate protection program. The EU played a crucial role in maintaining the Kyoto Protocol's momentum through international negotiations. The US program, which aims to reduce emissions by 18% relative to GDP by 2012, falls short of Kyoto's targets and is criticized for not addressing the need for absolute emission reductions. The article highlights the importance of US participation for the protocol's effectiveness and warns of severe climate impacts if decisive action is not taken. It also notes the economic benefits for Europe in leading on climate policies, including job creation and technological advancement. The door remains open for the US to rejoin the Kyoto process. END OF SUMMARY.
