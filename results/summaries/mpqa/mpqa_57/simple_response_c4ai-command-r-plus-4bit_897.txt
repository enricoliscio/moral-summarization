SUMMARY: The European Union has taken significant steps towards combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international agreement that sets binding targets for developed countries. This decision contrasts with the United States' withdrawal from the Protocol, despite being the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The US has instead presented its own national climate protection program, which falls far short of what is needed to effectively address climate change. While there is some satisfaction in President Bush recognizing the need for action, the US program lacks ambition and does not commit to meaningful reductions in emissions. The EU has rightly called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. The consequences of climate change are devastating, and a coordinated international response is crucial. The benefits of a robust climate protection policy extend beyond environmental gains, as it presents economic opportunities and contributes to full employment. The EU's leadership in this area is beneficial for its economy and should serve as a model for modernizing industrial societies. The return of the US to the Kyoto Process remains a crucial goal, as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases must be held accountable for global climate protection. 

END OF SUMMARY.
