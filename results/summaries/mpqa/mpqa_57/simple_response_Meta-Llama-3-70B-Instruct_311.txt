SUMMARY:

The European Union has taken a major step forward in combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision paves the way for the protocol's entry into force, but the US program's lack of ambition is a setback. The program aims to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is insufficient compared to the EU's 8% and Japan's 6% reduction targets. Climate experts warn that the US program will not prevent devastating consequences, including a 5.8Â°C rise in global temperature and 90cm sea level rise by 2100. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, and it is imperative that the US returns to the system. The EU's leadership on climate change will have economic benefits, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010. The US must recognize the importance of an active climate protection policy for both environmental and economic reasons.
