Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about climate change policies in Europe and the US, specifically the Kyoto Protocol.

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. The user has specified two main steps: Step 1 is to identify all single words that are morally framed. These words are highlighted in the text with asterisks. Then, in Step 2, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's quite detailed. Europe has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which is seen as a responsible and proactive move. The US, under Bush, pulled out, which is portrayed as a failure in leadership. The summary needs to highlight Europe's commitment and the US's shortcomings.

I should start by identifying the morally charged words. Words like "fundamentally flawed," "collapsed," "extreme weakness," "ambitious," "weak," "dramatic," "failure," "commitment," "ambitious," "failure," "weak," "dramatic," "failure," "commitment," "ambitious," "failure," "weak," "dramatic," "failure," "commitment," "ambitious," "failure," "weak," "dramatic," "failure," "commitment." Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants single words, so I need to pick each word that carries a moral judgment.

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes those morally framed words. The summary should contrast Europe's proactive stance with the US's lackluster effort, emphasizing the moral obligation and the consequences of inaction.

I should also highlight the economic benefits Europe is reaping from their policies, showing that moral action can also be economically beneficial. This reinforces the moral framing by showing that doing the right thing has positive outcomes.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, starts with the key points about Europe and the US, then moves to the consequences and the call for the US to rejoin the Kyoto Protocol. Ending with the importance of the US's role ties it all together.

I think I've got a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary morally framed words without making it too verbose. Let me count the words to stay under 200. 

Wait, I should also check if I've included all the key points: Europe's ratification, US withdrawal, the impact of their actions, the scientific warnings, and the economic benefits. Yes, that's all covered.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to write the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  

Recent weeks have seen contrasting approaches to climate change on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has made a significant move by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, positioning itself as a leader in global climate protection. In contrast, the United States, under President Bush, has pursued a weaker climate protection program, falling short of expectations and failing to match Europe's efforts. The US program, which aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, is criticized for being insufficient, especially given the projected increase in absolute emissions due to economic growth. Climate experts warn of the dramatic consequences of inaction, including rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, emphasizing the need for a coordinated international effort. Europe's proactive stance not only addresses environmental obligations but also drives economic growth and job creation, highlighting the moral and economic imperative for robust climate action. The return of the US to the Kyoto process remains a critical goal for global climate protection.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
