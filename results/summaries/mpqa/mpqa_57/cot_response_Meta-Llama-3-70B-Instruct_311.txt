SUMMARY:
The European Union has taken a significant step towards combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision is a "responsible" move, whereas the US program is criticized for its "extreme weakness". The program aims to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is considered insufficient, especially when compared to the EU's target of reducing emissions by 8% compared to 1990 levels. Climate experts have issued "warnings" about the need for rapid and decisive action to avert the "devastating" consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU's climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but also presents an "excellent opportunity" to modernize industrial society. END OF SUMMARY.
