SUMMARY: There have been some important developments in the policy for combating climate change on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, the council of environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, a major decision that opens the door to its entry into force. In contrast, the United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, yet the world community continued to deepen this important agreement. The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations, and the resulting agreement sets out an original mechanism for respecting reduction obligations. While all parties insisted that effective global climate protection requires comparable action from the US, the recent US climate protection program falls short of expectations. Although President Bush recognized the need to fight climate change, the program lacks ambition and fails to address the warnings of climate experts. The European Union's environment ministers called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. They emphasized that US reticence should not deter Europe from its own climate protection efforts, as an active and dominant climate protection policy brings benefits and can have a positive effect on employment. It is hoped that the US will realize that an active climate protection policy is necessary and presents an excellent opportunity for modernization. The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step and should be implemented quickly and extended beyond 2012. The door remains wide open for the US to return to the process and assume its responsibilities for global climate protection. END OF SUMMARY.
