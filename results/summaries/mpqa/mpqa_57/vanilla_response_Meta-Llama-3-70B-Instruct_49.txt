SUMMARY:

The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with the council of environment ministers agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. This move paves the way for the protocol's entry into force in time for the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls short of expectations, with a goal to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, which is considered unambitious. The program does not meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements, and scientists warn that the US must reduce its emissions by 70% by 2020 to mitigate the effects of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, and the EU's dominant role in climate protection policy is expected to have economic benefits, including the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010.
