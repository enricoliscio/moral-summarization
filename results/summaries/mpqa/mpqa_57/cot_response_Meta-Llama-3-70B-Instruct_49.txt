SUMMARY:
The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with environment ministers agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. This major decision paves the way for the protocol's entry into force, despite the United States' "fundamentally flawed" assessment and subsequent withdrawal. The EU's "dominant role" in international negotiations has led to an agreement that sets binding targets for developed countries. In contrast, the US national climate protection program falls "far short" of expectations, with an "extreme weakness" in its goals. Climate experts' "warnings" have been "unheeded," and the program's lack of ambition will lead to "dramatic" consequences. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to combat climate change. The EU's proactive climate policy will not only protect the environment but also create new jobs and drive economic growth. END OF SUMMARY.
