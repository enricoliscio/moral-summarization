SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. The European Union has taken a decisive step by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, 2002, paving the way for its entry into force ahead of the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. This commitment demonstrates the EU's assumption of its responsibilities in combating climate change.

In contrast, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, which sets binding targets for developed countries. Despite warnings from climate experts and the international community, the US has unveiled a national climate protection program that falls far short of expectations. The program lacks ambition and fails to commit to meaningful reductions in emissions.

The US program aims for an 18% improvement in energy efficiency by 2012, but this is expected to be offset by economic growth. By 2012, absolute US emissions are projected to be 24.5% higher than in 1990, far above the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. Scientists estimate that industrialized countries must reduce emissions by around 70% by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level. Without a rapid and coordinated international response, the consequences will be dire, with rising global temperatures, sea levels, and hurricanes.

The EU has called on the US to strengthen its domestic actions and assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change. The reticence of the United States to commit to ambitious climate protection measures should not deter Europe from its efforts. The EU's dominant role in climate protection policy brings economic benefits and contributes to full employment. The Kyoto Protocol is a significant first step, and the return of the United States to this agreement must remain a priority.
