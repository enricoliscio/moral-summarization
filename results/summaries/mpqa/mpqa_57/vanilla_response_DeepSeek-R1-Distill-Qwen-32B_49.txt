Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has made progress with the Kyoto Protocol, while the US has its own program. 

First, the EU environment ministers agreed on March 4 to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1. This is important because it aligns with the Johannesburg summit in August 2002. The US, on the other hand, under President Bush, pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, calling it flawed. Their new program aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP by 18% by 2012, but experts say it's not enough. 

The Kyoto Protocol requires the US to reduce emissions by 7% from 1990 levels, but the US program might actually increase emissions due to economic growth. Europe and Japan are setting the standard, and the US's lack of action is concerning. The article also mentions the economic benefits of climate policies, like job creation, and the need for the US to rejoin the Kyoto process.

I should include the key points: EU's ratification, US's inadequate program, comparison with Kyoto targets, economic benefits, and the call for US to return to the agreement. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on these main ideas.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union (EU) has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg summit in August 2002. Meanwhile, the United States, under President Bush, has unveiled a climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The US program aims to reduce emissions relative to GDP by 18% by 2012, but experts argue it is insufficient, as it may not prevent emissions from rising due to economic growth. The Kyoto Protocol requires the US to reduce emissions by 7% from 1990 levels, a target President Clinton had accepted. The EU and Japan are setting the standard, while the US's lack of comparable action is seen as a missed opportunity. The article highlights the economic benefits of climate policies, such as job creation, and calls for the US to rejoin the Kyoto process, emphasizing that the US, as the largest emitter, cannot avoid its global responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
