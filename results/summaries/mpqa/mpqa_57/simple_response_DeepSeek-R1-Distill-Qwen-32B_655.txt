Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies in Europe and the US. Europe has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big step. The US, on the other hand, pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol and has a weaker program.

I should highlight the contrast between Europe's proactive approach and the US's lackluster effort. The moral aspect is clear: Europe is taking responsibility, while the US is failing to do so, which is a problem because the US is a major emitter.

The article mentions the potential economic benefits for Europe by investing in green technologies. That's another point to include. Also, the warnings from climate experts about the consequences of inaction should be noted to emphasize the urgency.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Europe's ratification, mention the US's program, compare their targets, discuss the economic implications, and end with the call for the US to join. Make sure to keep the moral tone, highlighting Europe's leadership and the US's responsibility.

Okay, I think I have all the key points. Time to put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has reached a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its entry into force in time for the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. This move underscores Europe's commitment to combating climate change and its leadership in international efforts. Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has unveiled a national climate protection program that falls far short of expectations. President Bush's plan aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is insufficient to meet the ambitious targets set by the Kyoto Protocol, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2001. Experts warn that without U.S. participation, global efforts to stabilize emissions and prevent catastrophic climate change will be severely undermined. Europe is urging the U.S. to assume its responsibilities and join the international community in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. The article highlights the moral imperative for collective action and the potential economic benefits of investing in green technologies, emphasizing that climate protection is not only an environmental necessity but also an opportunity for industrial modernization. END OF SUMMARY.
