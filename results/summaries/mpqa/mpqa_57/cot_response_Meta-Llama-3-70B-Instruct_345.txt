SUMMARY:
The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with a formal agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls short of expectations, with a mere 18% increase in energy efficiency between 2002 and 2012. This is a far cry from the 7% reduction in emissions required by the Kyoto Protocol. Climate experts have warned of the devastating consequences of inaction, including a 5.8Â°C increase in global temperature and rising sea levels. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to combat climate change. The EU's dominant role in climate protection has economic benefits, creating new jobs and driving innovation in renewable energy. The US's reticence is no reason for the EU to reduce its climate protection efforts, and the door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process. END OF SUMMARY.
