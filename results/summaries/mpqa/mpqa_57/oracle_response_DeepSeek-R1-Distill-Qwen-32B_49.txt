Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about recent developments in climate change policies in Europe and the US. Europe is moving forward with the Kyoto Protocol, while the US has pulled back, which the author seems to disapprove of.

The author uses words like "withdrew," "withdrawal," "warnings," and "unheeded," which carry moral implications. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The article contrasts Europe's proactive stance with the US's lackluster effort, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation.

I should highlight the EU's agreement to ratify Kyoto in time for the Johannesburg summit, showing their commitment. The US, under Bush, has a weaker program, which isn't enough according to the author. The moral framing here is about responsibility and the consequences of inaction.

I'll also mention the scientific warnings about the need for rapid action and the potential consequences of not meeting targets. The author points out that the US's program isn't ambitious enough, using terms like "extreme weakness" and "reticence." 

Additionally, the article talks about the economic benefits of climate protection for Europe, creating jobs and leading in technology. The moral aspect here is about not just environmental responsibility but also economic opportunity.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the specified moral words as possible. I'll structure it to first state Europe's actions, then contrast with the US's withdrawal and weak program, mention the scientific warnings, and conclude with the economic benefits and the call for US involvement.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear, ensuring the moral framing is evident. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen contrasting developments in climate change policies across the Atlantic. The European Union finalized a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. This move underscores Europe's commitment to combating climate change. In contrast, the United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, describing it as "fundamentally flawed." The US introduced a climate protection program, but it falls far short of expectations, failing to match Europe and Japan's efforts. The program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, which is insufficient given the need for rapid and decisive action to avert climate disaster. Scientists warn that industrialized nations must reduce emissions by 70% by 2020 to stabilize the climate. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" under the climate change framework, emphasizing the need for global cooperation. The author highlights the economic benefits of climate protection, such as job creation and technological leadership, while urging the US to recommit to the Kyoto Protocol. The withdrawal of the US from the agreement has not halted international progress, but its reticence risks exacerbating the climate crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
