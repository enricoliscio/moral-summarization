SUMMARY:

The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with environment ministers agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls short of expectations. The program aims to reduce US emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is considered unambitious and will not meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements. Climate experts warn that rapid and decisive action is needed to avert the most serious consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and to strengthen domestic actions to bring emissions in line with the level of effort accepted by industrial countries. The EU's climate protection policy is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010 and is seen as an opportunity to modernize industrial society.
