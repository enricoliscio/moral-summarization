Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and identify where these words fit in.

The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big step. The US, on the other hand, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, which the author seems to criticize. President Bush's climate program is mentioned, but it's not as strong as the Kyoto targets. The author uses words like "withdrew" and "withdrawal" to highlight the US's decision, which is portrayed negatively.

The article also mentions the EU's leadership in the Bonn and Marrakech conferences, showing their commitment. The US program's weakness is emphasized with words like "unheeded" because the warnings from climate experts were ignored. The author uses "rapid" and "decisive" to stress the urgency needed, which the US didn't meet.

The EU's actions are framed positively, using words like "assume responsibilities," "strengthen," and "committing." The US's reticence is criticized, and the author hopes the US will return to the Kyoto process, using "relieved" in a negative context, meaning the US shouldn't be relieved of their responsibilities.

I need to make sure the summary includes these words and captures the moral stance: Europe is leading responsibly, while the US is lagging and not fulfilling its duties. The economic benefits of climate policies for Europe are also a point, showing the positive framing.

I should structure the summary to first mention Europe's actions, then the US's withdrawal and weak program, the consequences, and the call for the US to return. I'll use the morally framed words where appropriate to maintain the author's tone.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has reached a formal political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by 1 June, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg summit. Meanwhile, the United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has presented a national climate protection program that falls far short of expectations. The US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "fundamentally flawed," but the international community, led by the EU, has continued to strengthen the agreement through the Bonn and Marrakech conferences. The US program, which aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, is criticized for its weakness, as it fails to meet the ambitious targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. Climate experts have warned that without rapid and decisive action, the consequences of climate change will be catastrophic. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic efforts. The author emphasizes that the US's reticence should not relieve it of its obligations, as the Kyoto Protocol remains a critical first step in global climate protection. The EU's leadership in this area not only benefits the environment but also has positive economic implications, creating jobs and fostering innovation in clean technologies. END OF SUMMARY.
