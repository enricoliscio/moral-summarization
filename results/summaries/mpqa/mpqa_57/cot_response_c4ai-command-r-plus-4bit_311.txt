SUMMARY:
Important developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic are reported, with Europe making a major decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, 2002, and the United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrawing from binding international targets. Despite the US withdrawal, the world community, led by the European Union, deepened this important agreement, concluding the Bonn-Marrakech agreement with an original mechanism for respecting reduction obligations. All parties insisted that effective world climate protection requires comparable measures by the United States. However, the recent US climate protection program falls short of expectations, with President Bush recognizing the need to act but announcing a weak program. The US program aims for an 18% increase in energy efficiency by 2012, but this is expected anyway due to productivity levels, and absolute emissions will still increase with economic growth. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires the EU, Japan, and the US to reduce emissions by 2008-2012 compared to 1990 levels. Climate experts warn of dramatic consequences if no decisive action is taken, with industrialized countries needing to reduce emissions by 70% by 2020 to maintain acceptable climate change levels. The EU ministers called on the US to assume its responsibilities and stabilize emissions, but US reticence is not a reason for Europe to reduce its efforts. An active climate protection policy can benefit the economy and create jobs. The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step that should be quickly implemented and extended, with the US returning to the system. The door remains wide open for the US to re-join, as the biggest emitter cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection. END OF SUMMARY.
