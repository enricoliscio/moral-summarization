Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big step towards its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. The US, on the other hand, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol under Bush, calling it flawed. Their new program is criticized for being weak, not meeting expectations, and failing to address the warnings from climate experts.

The author uses words like "withdrew," "withdrawal," "warnings," "unheeded," etc. I need to incorporate these into the summary. I should highlight the contrast between Europe's proactive stance and the US's lackluster effort. Also, the moral implications of the US's actions, like their reticence and the potential consequences if they don't strengthen their policies.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Europe's agreement and the importance of the Kyoto Protocol. Then, contrast that with the US's withdrawal and the weakness of their program. Include the warnings from the IPCC and the potential consequences. Finally, mention the economic benefits for Europe and the hope for the US to return to the Kyoto process.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, uses the moral words, and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen contrasting developments in climate change policy across the Atlantic. Europe has made significant strides by formally agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, aiming for its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. This move underscores Europe's commitment to combating climate change and setting a global standard. In contrast, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, describing it as "fundamentally flawed." President Bush's climate protection program, unveiled in February, has been criticized for falling far short of expectations. While the program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, this is deemed insufficient given the warnings from climate experts and the IPCC's call for rapid and decisive action. The US program fails to match Europe and Japan's efforts under the Kyoto Protocol, which requires the EU to reduce emissions by 8% and the US by 7% compared to 1990 levels. The consequences of inaction are dire, with projections of a 5.8Â°C rise in global temperatures and rising sea levels. Europe has called on the US to assume its responsibilities and strengthen its climate protection efforts, emphasizing that the US cannot be relieved of its global obligations. The article highlights the moral imperative for the US to return to the Kyoto process, as its reticence risks exacerbating the climate crisis and undermining international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
