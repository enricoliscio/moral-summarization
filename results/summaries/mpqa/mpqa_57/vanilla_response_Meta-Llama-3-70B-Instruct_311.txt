SUMMARY:

Recent developments in climate change policy have seen the European Union take a significant step forward, with environment ministers agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. This move paves the way for the protocol's entry into force in time for the Johannesburg summit in August. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls short of expectations, with a goal to reduce emissions by only 18% between 2002 and 2012. This is far from the 7% reduction required by the Kyoto Protocol. Climate experts warn that the US program is inadequate to address the severity of climate change, which could lead to devastating consequences such as a 5.8Â°C rise in global temperature by 2100. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, and has emphasized the economic benefits of an active climate protection policy, which could create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010.
