SUMMARY:
The European Union has taken a major step towards combating climate change by concluding a formal political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision is a "responsible" move, opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, whereas the US program is “extremely weak” and “fundamentally flawed”. The EU's efforts are seen as “ambitious” and “necessary”, while the US program lacks the required commitment. The EU has called on the US to “assume its responsibilities” under the framework agreement on climate change. The EU's climate protection policy is not only good for the environment but also has economic benefits, creating new jobs and opportunities for modernizing industrial society. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and take its “responsibilities” for global climate protection. END OF SUMMARY.
