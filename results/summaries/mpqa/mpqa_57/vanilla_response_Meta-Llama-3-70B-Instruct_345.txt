SUMMARY:

Recent developments in Europe and the US have significant implications for combating climate change. The European Union has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, paving the way for its entry into force, while the US has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision is a major step forward, but the US program is criticized for its lack of ambition, with emissions set to increase by 24.5% by 2012 despite improvements in energy efficiency. Climate experts warn that rapid and decisive action is needed to avert the most serious consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, and European environment ministers believe that an active climate protection policy can have positive effects on the economy, creating new jobs and driving innovation in clean technologies. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process.
