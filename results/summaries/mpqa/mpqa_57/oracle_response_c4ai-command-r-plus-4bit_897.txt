SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. While the European Union has taken a decisive step towards ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the US withdrawal from the agreement has almost led to the collapse of international negotiations. The US climate protection program falls far short of expectations, with weak targets that do not address the urgent warnings made by climate experts. The US program aims for an 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP by 2012, which is not ambitious given expected productivity levels. Without rapid and determined action, the consequences of climate change will be dire, as emphasized by scientists. The EU environment ministers have called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. The US reticence to commit to ambitious targets should not deter Europe from its own climate protection efforts, which have economic benefits and contribute to full employment. The Kyoto Protocol is a significant first step, and the return of the US to the agreement must remain a goal. The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
