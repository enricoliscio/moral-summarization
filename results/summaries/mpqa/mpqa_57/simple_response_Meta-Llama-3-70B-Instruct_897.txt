SUMMARY:

The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change by concluding a formal agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision paves the way for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force, but the US program's lack of ambition is a major concern. The program aims to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is not enough to meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements. Climate experts warn that the US program will not prevent devastating consequences, including a 5.8Â°C increase in global temperature and rising sea levels. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol, and it is crucial that the US returns to the agreement. The EU's leadership on climate protection is not only necessary for environmental policy but also presents economic opportunities, including the creation of new jobs.
