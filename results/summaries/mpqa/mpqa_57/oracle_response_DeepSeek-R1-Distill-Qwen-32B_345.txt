Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about recent developments in climate policy between Europe and the US. Europe ratified the Kyoto Protocol, while the US pulled out and has a weaker program. The article emphasizes the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and the negative impact of the US withdrawal.

I need to identify the key moral terms: withdrew, withdrawal, warnings, unheeded, rapid, decisive, estimate, shown, assume, strengthen, committing, reticence, show, relieved. I should incorporate these into the summary.

I'll start by mentioning Europe's ratification and the US withdrawal. Then, highlight the US program's weakness compared to Kyoto targets. Include the IPCC's warnings and the US ignoring them. Emphasize the consequences of inaction and Europe's call for the US to take responsibility. Also, touch on the economic benefits for Europe and the hope for the US to rejoin.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union reached a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg summit. Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "fundamentally flawed." Despite this withdrawal, the international community, led by the EU, strengthened the Protocol through agreements at Bonn and Marrakech, establishing mechanisms for emission reductions. However, the US climate protection program, announced by President Bush, falls far short of expectations, failing to match Europe and Japan's efforts. The US program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is insufficient to meet the Protocol's targets or the IPCC's warnings for decisive action. Scientists estimate that industrialized countries must reduce emissions by 70% by 2020 to avoid catastrophic climate change. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen domestic actions, emphasizing that the US cannot be relieved of its global climate protection duties. Europe's climate policy not only benefits the environment but also drives economic growth and job creation. The return of the US to the Kyoto process remains a critical goal to address the urgent need for global climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
