SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. The European Union has taken a leading role in international negotiations and is set to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an important multilateral agreement for combating climate change, by June 1, 2002. Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, but has recently presented its own national climate protection program. However, this program falls far short of what is needed to effectively combat climate change, as it only aims for a modest increase in energy efficiency over the next decade. Experts warn that much more drastic reductions in emissions are required to avoid the most serious consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent hurricanes, and shifts in climate and rainfall zones. The European Union has called on the United States to take more ambitious action and to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change. Despite the economic benefits of a strong climate protection policy, the United States has yet to commit to more ambitious targets, and its return to the Kyoto Process remains a key goal for global climate protection efforts.
