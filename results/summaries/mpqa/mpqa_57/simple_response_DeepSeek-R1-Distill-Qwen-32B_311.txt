Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about climate change policies in Europe and the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about Europe ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and the US's climate program. The author seems critical of the US for not doing enough. I should highlight that contrast. 

First, I'll note the key points: Europe's agreement on Kyoto, the US's program being insufficient, the environmental impact if the US doesn't act, and the economic benefits for Europe. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral stance, like the responsibility the US has. 

I'll start by mentioning Europe's move and the US's response. Then point out the US program's weakness compared to Kyoto targets. Include the scientific warnings about climate change consequences. Finally, note Europe's economic advantage and the call for the US to join. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral elements are clear.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has reached a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development. In contrast, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has unveiled a national climate protection program that falls short of the ambitious targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. While President Bush acknowledges the need to address climate change, his program aims for an 18% reduction in emissions per GDP by 2012, which experts argue is insufficient. This contrasts sharply with the EU's commitment to an 8% reduction and Japan's 6% target. Climate experts warn that without decisive action, global temperatures could rise by 5.8Â°C by 2100, leading to catastrophic consequences. The EU has called on the United States to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto framework, emphasizing the importance of international coordination. Europe's proactive approach not only benefits the environment but also drives economic growth, creating jobs and fostering innovation in clean technologies. The US's reluctance to commit to stronger measures risks global climate stability and economic competitiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
