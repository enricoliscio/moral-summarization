SUMMARY: The recent developments in combating climate change on both sides of the Atlantic have had important moral implications. In Europe, the council of environment ministers reached a significant agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, a decision that opens the door to its entry into force for climate protection. This move sets the stage for the upcoming world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. However, it is important to note that the United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, had previously withdrawn from international negotiations, describing the protocol as "fundamentally flawed." Despite this setback, the European Union played a dominant role in the negotiations, and the community of states concluded an important agreement at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences. This agreement sets out an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations and could serve as a model for strengthening international institutional structures in the environmental field. 

While the European Union is taking decisive action, the US climate protection program falls short of expectations. President Bush has recognized the need to combat climate change, but the program lacks ambition. The US program targets an 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP, which is far from what is required to avert the devastating consequences of climate change. Experts warn that industrialized countries must reduce emissions by around 70% by 2020 to maintain an acceptable level of climate change. The EU environment ministers have rightly insisted that effective global climate protection requires comparable actions from the United States, calling on them to assume their responsibilities under the framework agreement. 

Despite the US reticence, the European climate protection policy has moral and economic benefits. An active policy of climate protection can promote full employment and create new jobs. It is also an opportunity to modernize industrial society and ensure that the Kyoto Protocol, a first major step, is quickly implemented and extended beyond the initial period. The door remains wide open for the United States to return to the Kyoto process and assume its responsibilities for global climate protection.
