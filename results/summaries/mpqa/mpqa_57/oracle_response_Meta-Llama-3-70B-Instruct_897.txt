SUMMARY:

The European Union has taken a major step in combating climate change by concluding a formal political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The US program's goal of increasing energy efficiency by 18% is deemed unambitious, and its failure to address the warnings of climate experts is a concern. In contrast, the EU, Japan, and other developed countries have committed to reducing their emissions by 8%, 6%, and 7%, respectively, under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to combat climate change. The consequences of inaction will be devastating, with rising global temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events. The EU's leadership on climate protection has economic benefits, creating new jobs and driving innovation in clean technologies. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and assume its responsibilities for global climate protection.
