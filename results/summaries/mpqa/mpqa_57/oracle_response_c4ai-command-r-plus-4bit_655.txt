SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. The European Union has taken a decisive step by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, 2002, demonstrating its commitment to global climate protection. In contrast, the United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, claiming it to be "fundamentally flawed." Despite the US withdrawal, the world community has continued to strengthen the agreement, with the EU playing a dominant role. The Bonn and Marrakech conferences in 2001 resulted in an agreement on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the creation of an original mechanism for respecting reduction obligations. However, the effectiveness of global climate protection hinges on the United States assuming its responsibilities and taking comparable measures to those taken by Europe and Japan. Unfortunately, the recent US climate protection program falls far short of expectations, with a mere 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP between 2002 and 2012. This lack of ambition is especially concerning given the warnings from climate experts about the urgent need for rapid action to avert the most devastating consequences of climate change. The EU environment ministers have called on the US to strengthen its domestic actions and commit to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions, but their warnings have gone unheeded. The US's reticence to commit to ambitious climate protection measures could have serious economic and environmental repercussions, and it is imperative that the US returns to the Kyoto process and assumes its responsibilities for global climate protection.
