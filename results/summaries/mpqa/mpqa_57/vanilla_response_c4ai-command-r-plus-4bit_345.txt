SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic are discussed, with a focus on the European Union's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the United States' withdrawal from it. The EU's environment ministers have agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, 2002, ahead of the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, the US, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The US program aims for an 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP by 2012, which is not considered ambitious enough and may not lead to absolute emission reductions if economic growth continues. The EU, on the other hand, is committed to reducing emissions by 8% compared to 1990 levels. Experts warn that without more decisive action, the consequences of climate change will be severe, including a significant rise in global temperature and sea levels, and an increase in hurricanes. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change and strengthen its domestic actions. The EU believes that an active climate protection policy is beneficial for the economy and can create new jobs, and hopes that the US will recognize the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and re-join the global efforts to combat climate change.
