SUMMARY: In recent developments, the European Union has taken an important decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, opening the door for its entry into force before the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. This comes after the United States, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the agreement, which set binding targets for developed countries to combat climate change. Despite the US withdrawal, the international community, led by the EU, concluded the Bonn and Marrakech agreements, outlining a mechanism for implementing the protocol and respecting reduction obligations. While the US has presented a national climate protection program, it falls short of expectations and fails to address the urgent need to avert the devastating consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, as the effects of climate change are devastating, and an active climate protection policy is necessary for environmental protection and offers economic benefits. The Kyoto Protocol is a first step, and the US must return to the system and commit to reducing emissions, as the biggest emitter cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
