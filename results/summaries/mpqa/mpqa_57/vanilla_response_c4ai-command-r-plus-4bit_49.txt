SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. In Europe, the council of environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, 2002, ahead of the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol but recently unveiled its own national climate protection program. However, the US program falls short of what is needed to effectively combat climate change, as it only targets an 18% reduction in emissions intensity (emissions per GDP) by 2012, which is likely to be offset by economic growth. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires the EU, Japan, and the US to reduce emissions by 8%, 6%, and 7% respectively compared to 1990 levels. Experts warn that much more ambitious targets are needed to avoid the most serious consequences of climate change, including dramatic shifts in temperature, sea levels, and rainfall patterns. The EU has urged the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. Despite the US's reticence, Europe remains committed to its climate protection policy, recognizing the economic benefits of developing energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The EU believes that an ambitious climate protection policy is compatible with full employment and can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010.
