SUMMARY:

Recent developments on both sides of the Atlantic have brought climate change policy to the forefront. The European Union has taken a major step forward by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. President Bush's program is "fundamentally flawed" and lacks ambition, with a mere 18% increase in energy efficiency, which will be cancelled out by economic growth. This is a far cry from the 7% reduction in emissions required by the Kyoto Protocol. Climate experts' warnings have gone unheeded, and the program fails to address the urgent need for rapid and decisive action to avert the devastating consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to bring them in line with the Kyoto Protocol. The US's reticence should not deter the EU from pursuing its climate protection efforts, which will create new jobs and drive innovation. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and assume its responsibilities for global climate protection.
