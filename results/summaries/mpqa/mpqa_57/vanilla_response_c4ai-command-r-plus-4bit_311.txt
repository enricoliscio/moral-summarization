SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic are discussed, with a focus on the European Union's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the United States' withdrawal from it. The EU's environment ministers agreed to ratify the protocol by June 1, 2002, despite the US's decision to withdraw, citing the protocol as "fundamentally flawed." The US's recent climate protection program falls short of expectations, with a target to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, which is far less ambitious than the reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol. The EU has urged the US to "assume its responsibilities" under the framework agreement and stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the need for comparable efforts from the US to ensure effective global climate protection. The article also highlights the economic benefits of a strong climate protection policy, including the creation of new jobs and the development of future technologies in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The EU's goal remains the return of the US to the Kyoto Process and its commitment to global climate protection responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
