Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe's environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, which is before the Johannesburg summit. That's a big move for the EU.

In the US, President Bush presented a national climate program. But the US pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, which was a big deal because they're the biggest emitter. The EU took a lead in the negotiations, resulting in an agreement at Bonn and Marrakech. Now, all parties need to ratify it, and it'll come into force soon.

The article points out that without the US's participation, the Kyoto Protocol's effectiveness is limited. The US program aims to reduce emissions as a percentage of GDP by 18% by 2012, but that's not enough. The EU and Japan have more ambitious targets, and the US's plan won't meet the required reductions.

Climate experts are warning about the consequences of inaction. The EU is pushing the US to take responsibility, and their climate policies are also economically beneficial, creating jobs and boosting industries like renewable energy.

So, the summary should cover the EU's ratification, the US's weak program, the importance of the Kyoto Protocol, and the economic benefits of climate policies for Europe. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union (EU) has reached a political agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, 2002, ensuring its entry into force in time for the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. Meanwhile, the United States, under President Bush, presented a national climate protection program, which falls short of expectations. The US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, a move that nearly collapsed international negotiations, but the EU and other nations finalized an implementation agreement at Bonn and Marrakech. The EU emphasizes the need for the US to take comparable action, as its absence weakens the Protocol's effectiveness. The US program aims to reduce emissions as a percentage of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is insufficient compared to the EU and Japan's targets. Climate experts warn of severe consequences, including rising temperatures and sea levels, if decisive action isn't taken. The EU highlights the economic benefits of its climate policies, which could create jobs and drive innovation in renewable energy. The article calls for the US to rejoin the Kyoto process, as its participation is crucial for global climate protection. END OF SUMMARY.
