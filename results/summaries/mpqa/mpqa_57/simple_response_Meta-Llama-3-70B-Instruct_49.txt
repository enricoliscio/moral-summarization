SUMMARY:

The European Union has taken a significant step towards combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision opens the door for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force, but the US program lacks ambition, with emissions expected to increase by 24.5% by 2012 despite a 18% increase in energy efficiency. Climate experts warn that rapid and decisive action is needed to avert the most serious consequences of climate change, and the EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement. The EU's dominant role in climate protection policy has benefits for its economy, with an active policy expected to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010. The US is urged to return to the Kyoto process, as its withdrawal undermines global climate protection efforts.
