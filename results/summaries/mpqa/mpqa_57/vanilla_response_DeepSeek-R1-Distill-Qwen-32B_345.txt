Okay, so I need to summarize this article about climate change policies in Europe and the US. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about recent developments on both sides of the Atlantic regarding climate change. In Europe, the environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June, which will help it take effect before the Johannesburg summit. The US, on the other hand, under President Bush, pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, calling it flawed. Their new program aims to reduce emissions as a percentage of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this isn't as ambitious as the Kyoto targets. The EU and Japan are reducing their emissions, while the US is only aiming for a 7% reduction, which isn't enough according to experts.

The article also mentions the potential economic benefits for Europe by leading in climate tech, creating jobs, and the importance of the US rejoining the Kyoto process. It warns about the consequences of inaction, like rising temperatures and sea levels.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the EU's ratification, the US's weaker program, the comparison with Kyoto targets, the economic benefits for Europe, and the call for the US to rejoin. I'll make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant climate policy developments in Europe and the United States. The EU's environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June, ensuring its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. Meanwhile, the U.S., the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, citing it as flawed, and introduced a weaker climate protection program. The U.S. plan aims to reduce emissions as a percentage of GDP by 18% by 2012, far less ambitious than the Kyoto targets requiring the U.S. to reduce emissions by 7% from 1990 levels. Europe and Japan are on track to meet their Kyoto targets, while the U.S. program is criticized for failing to address the severity of climate change. The EU emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and urges the U.S. to assume its climate responsibilities. Europe's proactive climate policies are expected to drive economic growth and create jobs, positioning it as a leader in sustainable technologies. The article highlights the urgent need for global action to combat climate change and the necessity of the U.S. rejoining the Kyoto process. END OF SUMMARY.
