Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has made progress by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, 2002, which will allow it to take effect just in time for the Johannesburg summit. The EU is taking a leadership role here.

On the other hand, the US under President Bush introduced a climate protection program. The article points out that Bush had criticized the Kyoto Protocol as "fundamentally flawed," leading the US to withdraw from it. This withdrawal didn't stop the international community, with the EU leading the way in negotiations at Bonn and Marrakech, resulting in an agreement to implement Kyoto.

The US program is criticized for being weak. It aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% between 2002 and 2012, which isn't ambitious enough. The EU and Japan have more stringent targets. The article mentions that even with the US's plan, emissions will increase due to economic growth, unlike the required reductions under Kyoto.

There's a moral emphasis on the US's responsibility, as they're the largest emitter. The EU is urging the US to take more action, not just for environmental reasons but also economically. Investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy can create jobs and technological leadership.

The summary needs to capture the contrast between Europe's proactive approach and the US's lackluster effort, highlighting the moral obligation and economic benefits of strong climate policies.

I should structure the summary to first mention Europe's progress with Kyoto, then the US's inadequate response, the criticism of the US program, the economic benefits of climate action, and the call for the US to rejoin the international effort.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear: Europe leading responsibly, US failing to meet obligations, and the importance of international cooperation for both environmental and economic reasons.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant progress in Europe and setbacks in the U.S. regarding climate change policies. The EU agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its implementation before the Johannesburg summit. Meanwhile, President Bush's climate protection program, though acknowledging the need to address climate change, falls short of the ambitious targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. The U.S., as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has withdrawn from the Protocol, which the EU and other nations have strengthened through recent agreements. The U.S. program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is insufficient, as emissions are projected to rise due to economic growth. Experts warn that without decisive action, climate change will have devastating effects. The EU emphasizes the moral and economic imperative for the U.S. to take stronger measures, highlighting that climate protection can drive technological innovation and job creation. The EU urges the U.S. to assume its global responsibilities and rejoin the Kyoto process, as international cooperation is crucial for effective climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
