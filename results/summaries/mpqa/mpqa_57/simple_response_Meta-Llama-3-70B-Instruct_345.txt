SUMMARY:

The European Union has taken a significant step towards combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a major international agreement that sets binding targets for developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The program aims to reduce emissions by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is deemed insufficient as it will not lead to a reduction in absolute emissions. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and to strengthen its domestic actions to bring emissions in line with the level of effort accepted by industrial countries. The EU's climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but also presents an opportunity to modernize industrial society and create new jobs. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and take its responsibilities for global climate protection seriously.
