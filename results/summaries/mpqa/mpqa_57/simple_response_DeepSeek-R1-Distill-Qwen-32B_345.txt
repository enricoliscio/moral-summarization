Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about climate change policies in Europe and the US. Europe ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big deal because it's a step towards combating climate change. The US, on the other hand, pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol under Bush, which weakened the global effort. Their new program isn't as strong as what Europe and Japan are doing. 

The moral angle here is about responsibility and leadership. Europe is taking a proactive approach, which is seen as responsible and setting a good example. The US's lackluster effort is criticized because they're the biggest emitter and should take more action. There's also a point about economic benefitsâ€”Europe is investing in green technologies, which can create jobs and keep them competitive. 

I need to make sure the summary highlights Europe's leadership, the US's shortcomings, the moral responsibility, and the economic positives of climate action. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without getting too technical.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, ensuring its entry into force before the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. Meanwhile, the United States, under President Bush, has unveiled a climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The US program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is criticized as insufficient, especially compared to the Kyoto Protocol's requirements for the US to reduce emissions by 7% from 1990 levels. The EU and Japan have taken more ambitious steps, and the US's failure to match these efforts is seen as a missed opportunity to address the urgent need for global climate action. The article emphasizes the moral responsibility of the US, as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to take stronger measures. It also highlights the economic benefits of climate protection policies, such as job creation and technological innovation, urging the US to recognize the importance of rejoining international efforts like the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
