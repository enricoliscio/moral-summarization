SUMMARY:

The European Union has made significant progress in combating climate change, with environment ministers concluding a formal agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. In contrast, the US has fallen short of expectations with its recent climate protection program, which fails to meet the standards set by Europe and Japan. Despite recognizing the need to fight climate change, President Bush's program is "extremely weak" and does not heed the warnings of climate experts. The program's goal of increasing energy efficiency by 18% is unambitious and will not lead to a reduction in absolute emissions. The EU, on the other hand, is committed to reducing its emissions by 8% compared to 1990 levels. The author urges the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to bring them in line with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU's leadership on climate protection will have economic benefits, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs by 2010. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and take its responsibilities for global climate protection seriously.
