SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. While the European Union has taken a dominant and decisive role in combating climate change, the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol and its recent climate protection program fall short of international expectations. The US program, which aims for an 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP by 2012, is not ambitious enough and fails to heed the warnings of climate experts. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol, soon to be ratified by the EU, sets binding targets for developed countries, with the EU committed to reducing emissions by 8%, Japan by 6%, and the US by 7% compared to 1990 levels. Scientists estimate that industrialized countries must reduce emissions by around 70% by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level. The EU environment ministers have called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. The US's reticence to commit to ambitious climate protection programs may hinder global efforts, but it also presents economic opportunities for Europe in the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. An active climate protection policy can also contribute to full employment and modernizing industrial society. The return of the US to the Kyoto process remains an important goal for global climate protection efforts.
