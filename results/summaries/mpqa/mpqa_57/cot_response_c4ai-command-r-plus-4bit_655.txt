SUMMARY: This news article discusses the recent important developments in combating climate change on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, the council of environment ministers reached an agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, a decision that opens the door for its entry into force for climate protection. Meanwhile, in the United States, President Bush presented a national climate protection program, despite previously describing the Kyoto Protocol as "fundamentally flawed," which almost collapsed international negotiations. The US, as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the agreement that set binding targets for developed countries. However, the European Union played a dominant role in negotiations, and the community concluded an agreement on how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and respect reduction obligations. While all parties insist that effective world climate protection requires comparable action from the US, the recent US program falls short of expectations. President Bush recognizes the need to fight climate change but announced a weak program. The US program aims for an 18% reduction in emissions as a proportion of GDP by increasing energy efficiency, but this is not ambitious given expected productivity levels and potential economic growth. Climate experts warn of the serious consequences of climate change and call for rapid action to reduce emissions. The EU ministers called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement and strengthen its domestic actions. The article highlights the economic benefits of an ambitious climate protection program and the positive impact on employment. The Kyoto Protocol is a first step, but the US must return to the system and be held responsible for global climate protection.
