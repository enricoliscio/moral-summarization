Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should not only be concise but also highlight the ethical implications and the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about recent developments in climate policy on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is a big deal because it allows the protocol to come into force just in time for the Johannesburg summit. On the other hand, the US under Bush presented a climate protection program that's been criticized as inadequate compared to Europe and Japan's efforts.

The article also mentions the consequences of not taking strong action, like rising temperatures and sea levels, more hurricanes, and shifts in climate zones. There's a moral emphasis on the US's responsibility, especially since they're the biggest emitter. The author seems critical of the US's lackluster program and emphasizes the economic benefits of climate protection for Europe, like job creation and technological advancement.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points succinctly. I should mention Europe's ratification, the US's insufficient program, the environmental consequences, and the economic and moral arguments for strong climate action. Also, the door is still open for the US to rejoin the Kyoto process, highlighting the importance of their participation.

I'll structure the summary to first outline Europe's actions, then contrast with the US's inadequate response, discuss the implications of inaction, and conclude with the moral and economic incentives for the US to join. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but comprehensive, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting: Europe has agreed to ratify Kyoto, which is timely for the Johannesburg summit. The US's program is weak, not meeting expectations. The article highlights the dire consequences of climate change and the economic benefits of climate policies. It calls for the US to take responsibility and return to the Kyoto process.

I should make sure to include key percentages and the comparison between the US's program and Kyoto targets. Also, the part about Europe's economic gain from climate policies is important for the moral framing, showing that it's not just about environment but also about economic progress and job creation.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together into a concise summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant developments in climate policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, enabling its entry into force in time for the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. In contrast, the United States, under President Bush, has unveiled a climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The US program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is far less ambitious than the Kyoto Protocol's requirements, which would have reduced US emissions by 7% from 1990 levels. The article highlights the moral imperative for the US to take stronger action, given its role as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Climate experts warn of dire consequences, including rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events, if decisive action is not taken. The EU emphasizes the importance of the US rejoining the Kyoto process, as its participation is crucial for effective global climate protection. The article also underscores the economic benefits of climate policies, such as job creation and technological innovation, reinforcing the moral and practical necessity for robust climate action. END OF SUMMARY.
