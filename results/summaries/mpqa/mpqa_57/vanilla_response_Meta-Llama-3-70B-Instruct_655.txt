SUMMARY:

Recent developments on both sides of the Atlantic have progressed the policy to combat climate change. The European Union has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002, paving the way for its entry into force. In contrast, the US has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The program aims to reduce US emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% between 2002 and 2012, but this is considered insufficient as it will not lead to an absolute reduction in emissions. The EU, on the other hand, is committed to reducing its emissions by 8% compared to 1990 levels. Climate experts warn that rapid and decisive action is needed to avert the serious consequences of climate change. The EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and to strengthen its domestic actions to combat climate change.
