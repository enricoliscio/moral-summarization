SUMMARY:

Recent developments in climate change policy have seen the European Union take a major step forward, while the United States has fallen short of expectations. The EU's environment ministers have agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, paving the way for its entry into force, whereas the US has presented a national climate protection program that is "fundamentally flawed" and lacks ambition. Despite recognizing the need to combat climate change, President Bush's program only aims to increase energy efficiency by 18%, which is far from the 7% reduction required by the Kyoto Protocol. The warnings from climate experts have gone unheeded, and the program's weaknesses will lead to increased emissions. The EU has called on the US to "assume its responsibilities" and strengthen its domestic actions to combat climate change. The US's reticence should not deter the EU from continuing its climate protection efforts, which will create new jobs and drive economic growth. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and take its responsibilities for global climate protection seriously.
