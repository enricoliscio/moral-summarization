SUMMARY: The European Union has taken significant steps towards combating climate change by agreeing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international agreement that sets binding targets for developed countries. This decision contrasts with the actions of the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol and instead presented its own national climate protection program. However, this program falls far short of what is needed to address the issue effectively, as highlighted by climate experts and the EU environment ministers. The US program lacks ambition and does not commit to the same level of effort as the industrial countries that accepted the Kyoto Protocol. The consequences of climate change are devastating, and the EU has urged the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change and strengthen its domestic actions. Despite economic competition, a weak US commitment to climate protection should not deter Europe's efforts. An active climate protection policy can positively impact full employment and modernize industrial society. The return of the US to the Kyoto Process remains a crucial goal, as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases must be held accountable for global climate protection.
