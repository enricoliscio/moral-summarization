Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. 

The article talks about recent developments in climate change policies on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, the EU environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1st, which will make it effective before the Johannesburg summit in August. This is a big step for the EU. 

On the other hand, the US has its own program. President Bush presented the national climate protection program, but it's not as strong as the Kyoto Protocol. The US pulled out of Kyoto because Bush called it flawed, but the EU and others continued and made progress in Bonn and Marrakech. 

The US program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, which isn't very ambitious. In fact, if the economy grows, emissions might even increase. The Kyoto Protocol requires the US to reduce emissions by 7%, but the current plan doesn't meet that. 

Climate experts warn that more drastic action is needed. The EU is pushing the US to take more responsibility. They also mention that climate policies can boost the economy and create jobs. The article ends by emphasizing the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and hoping the US will join back.

I should structure the summary to cover these points: EU's ratification of Kyoto, US's weaker program, the implications of both, and the call for the US to join. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key developments and outcomes without too much detail.

SUMMARY: Recent weeks have seen significant climate policy developments on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU has agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 1, enabling it to take effect before the Johannesburg summit in August. Meanwhile, the U.S., the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has unveiled a climate protection program that falls short of Kyoto's targets. The EU has emphasized the need for the U.S. to assume its responsibilities under the Kyoto framework, as global climate protection cannot be effective without U.S. action comparable to Europe and Japan. The U.S. program aims to reduce emissions as a proportion of GDP by 18% by 2012, but this is deemed insufficient, especially given potential economic growth that could offset gains. The EU highlights the economic benefits of climate protection, including job creation, and urges the U.S. to rejoin the Kyoto process. END OF SUMMARY.
