SUMMARY:
Recent developments on both sides of the Atlantic have seen the European Union take a dominant role in combating climate change, with a formal agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by June 2002. In contrast, the US national climate protection program presented by President Bush falls far short of expectations, with a mere 18% increase in energy efficiency by 2012. This is a weakness that will not meet the necessary reductions to combat climate change, and the EU has called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement. The consequences of climate change will be devastating if left unchecked, and the EU's active climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but also an excellent opportunity to modernize industrial society. The door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process and take responsible action to combat climate change.
