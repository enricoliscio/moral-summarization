SUMMARY:

The European Union has taken a significant step towards combating climate change by concluding a formal agreement to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the United States has presented a national climate protection program that falls short of expectations. The EU's decision opens the door for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force, despite the US's earlier withdrawal from the agreement. The US program, which aims to increase energy efficiency by 18%, is deemed "extremely weak" and will not meet the expectations of the international community. Climate experts' warnings have gone unheeded, and the program fails to assume the US's responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change. The EU has called on the US to strengthen its domestic actions and commit to an ambitious climate protection program. The EU's dominant role in climate protection policy has benefits for its economy, creating new jobs and driving innovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The US's reticence should not deter the EU from its climate protection efforts, and the door remains open for the US to return to the Kyoto process.
