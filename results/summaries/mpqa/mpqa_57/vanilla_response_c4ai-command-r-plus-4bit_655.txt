SUMMARY: Recent developments in climate change policy on both sides of the Atlantic have highlighted the differing approaches of Europe and the United States. In Europe, the council of environment ministers agreed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before June 1, 2002, paving the way for its entry into force ahead of the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol but recently unveiled its own national climate protection program. However, the US program falls far short of what is needed to effectively combat climate change. While there is some satisfaction that President Bush recognizes the need to act, the targets set by the US program are not ambitious enough and do not align with the efforts of Europe and Japan. Experts warn that much more needs to be done to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change, and the EU environment ministers have called on the US to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement. Despite the US's reticence, Europe remains committed to its climate protection efforts, recognizing the economic benefits of being at the forefront of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The European climate protection policy is expected to create several hundred thousand new jobs by 2010 and provides an opportunity to modernize industrial society. The goal remains to bring the US back into the Kyoto process and ensure they uphold their responsibilities for global climate protection. END OF SUMMARY.
