SUMMARY:
The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked indignation in Japan, with environmental groups calling it "absolutely inadmissible" for the US, the greatest gas-emitting country, to reject the accord. The decision has been seen as a "do-it-our-way" approach, fueling concerns that Washington is growing increasingly unilateralist. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, had taken pride in shaping the accord on their soil, and now feels that the US is turning its back on the protocol. The US alternative plan has been criticized for allowing the country to continue increasing its gas emissions, which could lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. The move has been seen as a signal that America is growing increasingly unilateralist, causing friction in US-Japanese relations. END OF SUMMARY.
