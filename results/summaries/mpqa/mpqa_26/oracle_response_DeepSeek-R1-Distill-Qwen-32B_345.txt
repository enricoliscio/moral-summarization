Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the US's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and how it's affecting relations, particularly with Japan. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The US isn't ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which Japan and others are upset about. Japan was proud of hosting the协议 and sees the US's decision as a problem. The article mentions environmental consequences, economic implications, and the impact on US-Japan relations.

I need to make sure to include words like "signed," "ratify," "irritated," "unilateralist," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the US's decision, the reactions from Japan, the environmental concerns, and the broader implications for international cooperation.

I'll start by stating the US's stance and its impact on the protocol's effectiveness. Then mention Japan's pride in the protocol and their irritation. Include the environmental consequences and the alternative plan the US is offering, which critics say isn't enough. Also, note the concerns about other countries backing out and the potential two-tier system.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to incorporate as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll also need to end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary points and moral terms.

SUMMARY: The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has caused irritation among its allies, particularly Japan, which took pride in hosting the agreement. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reefs dying, polar bears losing habitat, and birds migrating north, highlighting the urgency for global action. Japan, a nation valuing nature, sees the US's stance as a setback, with environmental groups criticizing Washington's "do-it-our-way" approach. The Bush administration's alternative plan, emphasizing market-sensitive measures, is seen as insufficient by critics, potentially leading to a two-tier system where the US and others set their own targets, while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. This unilateralist trend, including labeling nations as enemies and pulling out of global efforts, has strained US-Japan relations. While some in Japan, like industry groups, support the alternative, others fear it could harm international cooperation and environmental efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
