SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies are irritated by President George Bush's decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was signed by 150 countries in 1997, including Japan, which considered it a point of pride and a sign of their relevance on the world stage. However, the US's refusal to commit to the agreement has cast doubt on its effectiveness. The article highlights the moral dilemma between economic interests and environmental protection, with Japanese industry concerned about the impact of emission reduction policies on their competitiveness. Meanwhile, environmental advocates criticize the US for acting unilaterally and fear that its decision will lead to a two-tier system, where smaller nations are held to stricter limits while the US sets its own targets. The clash occurs at an awkward time in US-Japanese relations, with Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishing and some perceiving a unilateralist trend in US foreign policy post-9/11. Japan is particularly indignant about the US's decision on the Kyoto Protocol, seeing it as a rejection of a global effort to address a critical issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
