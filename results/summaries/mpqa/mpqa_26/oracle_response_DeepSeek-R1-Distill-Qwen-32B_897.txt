Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and the reaction from Japan. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The US isn't ratifying Kyoto, which is causing irritation, especially in Japan. There are environmental consequences mentioned, and Japan feels it's a blow to their efforts. The US has an alternative plan, but it's seen as not enough by environmental groups. There's also tension in US-Japan relations because of this.

I need to make sure to include words like "signed," "ratify," "irritated," "unilateralist," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the US's decision, Japan's reaction, the environmental implications, and the impact on international relations.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me start by mentioning the US refusing to ratify Kyoto, causing irritation. Then talk about Japan's pride in the protocol and their criticism. Mention the alternative plan and its criticisms. Finally, note the tension in US-Japan relations and the potential for a two-tier system.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is clear, using words like "irritated," "unilateralist," and "slight." Also, include the environmental consequences to show the stakes involved.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to hit all these points and stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol has caused irritation among its allies, particularly Japan, which played a key role in shaping the agreement. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reef death, polar bear habitat loss, and disrupted bird migration due to global warming. Japan, proud of its role in the Kyoto Protocol, criticizes the US for being the largest greenhouse gas emitter and for turning its back on the accord. US allies see this as part of a growing unilateralist trend, including actions like labeling Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an "axis of evil." The US offers an alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, but environmental advocates argue it allows continued gas emissions and risks a two-tier system. Japan's industry fears further emissions reductions could hurt competitiveness, while environmental groups worry smaller nations may back out of Kyoto. The US-Japan relationship is strained, with Japan expressing disappointment over the US stance. END OF SUMMARY.
