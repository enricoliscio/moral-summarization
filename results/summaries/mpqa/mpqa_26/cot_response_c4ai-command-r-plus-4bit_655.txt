SUMMARY:
Japan is irked by the US's stance on the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was shaped in part to address Washington's concerns, and Japan took pride in hosting the negotiations. However, with the US now refusing to ratify the agreement, many US allies, including Japan, are expressing indignation over what they perceive as a unilateralist decision by the Bush administration. The US is offering its own alternative plan, but environmental advocates fear it will allow the US to continue increasing its greenhouse gas emissions. They worry that this could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. While some in Japan share concerns about the potential impact on industrial competitiveness, environmental advocates and Japanese officials alike are advocating for further efforts by the US to address global warming within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. They view the US decision as a slight and a concerning signal of a tending towards unilateral action without consulting allies. The article highlights the moral framing of the issue, with terms like "evil" and "allies" used to describe the perspectives of those involved.
