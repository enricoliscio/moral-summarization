SUMMARY: Japan is irritated by the United States' decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was shaped to address Washington's concerns, and Japan took pride in hosting the negotiations. However, President George Bush has proposed an alternative plan, arguing that the Kyoto agreement will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness. Environmental advocates criticize Bush's plan, arguing that it will allow the US to continue increasing its greenhouse gas emissions and create a two-tier system with looser restrictions for some countries. The clash over how to address global warming while considering economic interests occurs amid shifting US-Japanese relations, with some analysts arguing that Japan's economic dominance in Asia is diminishing. Japan's efforts to support the post-9/11 war on terror, including altering its pacifist constitution, have been overlooked by the US. There is indignation in Japan over Washington's unilateral decision-making, with environmental groups expressing concern that the US is acting without consulting its allies. Japan's business lobby argues that further emissions reductions could hurt their competitiveness. Japan is caught between the need to address global warming and the potential economic impacts of emissions reductions.
END OF SUMMARY.
