SUMMARY:

The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change has sparked frustration in Japan, with many seeing it as a unilateralist move by the Bush administration. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is proud of its role in shaping the accord and feels the US, as the largest gas-emitting country, should take responsibility. Environmental groups in Japan argue that the US alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, will allow the US to increase gas emissions, potentially leading to a two-tier system where smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. While Japanese industry is not opposed to the US alternative, many in Japan feel the US is acting without consulting its allies, damaging the US-Japan relationship. The issue has become a symbol of the growing perception that the US is becoming increasingly unilateralist in its decision-making.
