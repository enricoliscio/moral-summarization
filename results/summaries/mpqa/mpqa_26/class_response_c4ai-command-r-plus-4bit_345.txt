SUMMARY: Japan is irritated by the US's decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The US's stance on the protocol, which was shaped in part to address Washington's concerns, has raised concerns among US allies about the country's increasing unilateralism in the six months since the September 11 attacks. Many countries, including Japan, view the US's decision as a turning of the back on the global effort to address climate change. The Bush administration has proposed an alternative plan, but environmental advocates fear it will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions and create a two-tier system where the US and a few other countries set their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. This has led to a clash between those who prioritize economic competitiveness and those who want to reduce emissions to protect the environment and combat global warming. Japan, a nation of nature lovers, is proud of its role in shaping the Kyoto Protocol and sees the US's decision as an attack on its relevance on the world stage. Meanwhile, Japanese industry fears that further emission reduction policies will hurt their competitiveness.
END OF SUMMARY.
