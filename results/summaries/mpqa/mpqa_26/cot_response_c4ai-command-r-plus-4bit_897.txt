SUMMARY:
The decision by the US not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has caused irritation in Japan and among US allies. Japan, a nation of nature lovers, took pride in the fact that the protocol was shaped on their soil in 1997. They now express indignation at the US' unilateral decision, with environmental groups calling the US' stance "inadmissible." The move is seen as part of a growing trend of unilateralism by the US in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The Bush administration has offered an alternative plan, but environmental advocates fear it will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions and hurt the competitiveness of Japanese industries that have already made significant efforts to reduce their environmental impact. There is concern that the US' actions could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. The article concludes by highlighting the dilemma between economic competitiveness and environmental responsibility, with some in Japan worried that further emissions reductions will hurt their industrial competitiveness.
