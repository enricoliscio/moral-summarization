SUMMARY: Japan is irked by the US decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. For Japan, the protocol was a source of pride as it was shaped on their soil, and it demonstrated their relevance on the world stage. Environmental advocates in Japan and elsewhere are outraged by the US decision, viewing it as a unilateralist move that could undermine the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The US has proposed its own alternative plan, but critics argue that it will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions and could create a two-tier system that hurts the competitiveness of Japanese industry. The Japanese government and environmental groups have expressed indignation over the US decision, with some likening it to a "do-it-our-way" attitude that ignores the potential harm to the global environment and the efforts of other nations. The US withdrawal from Kyoto and its labeling of certain countries as an "axis of evil" have further fueled concerns among allies that America is becoming increasingly unilateralist in the wake of the September 11 attacks. While some in Japan share concerns about the economic impact of the protocol, many see the US move as a slight against their country and a threat to the global effort to address climate change.
