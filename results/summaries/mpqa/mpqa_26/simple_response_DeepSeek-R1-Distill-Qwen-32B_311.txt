Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the US's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and how it's affecting relations, especially with Japan. It talks about the environmental consequences of global warming and the importance of the Kyoto Protocol. The US under Bush decided not to ratify it, which upsets Japan and other allies. Japan was proud to host the Kyoto talks and sees the US's decision as a setback. There's also mention of the US's alternative plan, which environmentalists criticize as not enough.

I should highlight the moral issues: the US's inaction on climate change, the impact on global efforts, and the frustration from allies like Japan. Also, note the potential consequences like a two-tier system if more countries follow the US.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clear. I'll structure it by introducing the issue, the US's decision, Japan's reaction, the alternative plan, and the potential negative outcomes.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring all key points are covered without getting too detailed. I'll focus on the moral implications and the international relations aspect.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and diplomatic implications of the U.S. decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which has caused frustration among its allies, particularly Japan. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, aimed to address global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S., the largest emitter, rejected the protocol, undermining its effectiveness and irritating countries like Japan, which viewed the agreement as a symbol of global cooperation and its own relevance on the world stage. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, felt proud to host the talks but now sees the U.S. as turning its back on a global responsibility. Environmental groups in Japan and elsewhere criticize the U.S. for its unilateral stance, fearing it could lead to a two-tier system where some countries, including the U.S., set their own targets, while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. The Bush administration proposed an alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which critics argue would allow the U.S. to continue increasing emissions. This decision, along with other unilateral actions post-9/11, has raised concerns about the U.S. moving away from multilateral cooperation. While some in Japan, like industrial groups, support the alternative plan, many view it as a step backward in the fight against climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
