SUMMARY: Japan is irked by the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was shaped partially to address Washington's concerns, and Japan took pride in hosting the negotiations in 1997. However, with the US backing out, there are concerns that other smaller nations may follow suit, creating a two-tier system with different targets for different countries. Japanese environmental advocates express moral outrage at the US's unilateral decision, arguing that it will have detrimental effects on the global effort to tackle climate change. They believe the US is putting its own economic interests ahead of the well-being of the planet and future generations. This decision also comes at an awkward time in US-Japanese relations, with some analysts predicting a decline in the importance of the alliance. While some Japanese industries are relieved by the US's alternative plan, which could give them a competitive advantage, others recognize the potential harm to the environment and support the Kyoto Protocol's stricter limits. Japan finds itself caught between economic concerns and moral responsibility for the planet, with environmental advocates urging a stronger commitment to global efforts to fight climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
