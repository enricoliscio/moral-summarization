Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the ethical or moral implications as presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which is causing irritation among its allies, especially Japan. There's a focus on the moral implications of this decision, such as the environmental consequences and the impact on international relations.

I notice the author uses several morally charged words like "die," "shaping," "turn," "clash," "attacks," "pulling," "labeling," "consult," "reduce," "finding," "increase," "implemented," and "hurt." My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key moral issues: the potential environmental disasters from global warming, the US's unilateral stance, the disappointment from Japan and other allies, and the concerns about the effectiveness of the alternative plan proposed by the US.

I'll start by stating the US's rejection of Kyoto and its impact on global efforts. Then, mention the moral implications like the dying reefs and animals. Next, address Japan's pride in the protocol and their disappointment. Include the clash between the US and Japan, the Bush administration's alternative plan, and the criticism it faces for allowing increased emissions. Finally, note the concerns about a two-tier system and the mixed reactions in Japan, especially from industry.

I need to make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the moral framing words where appropriate. Let me piece this together concisely, ensuring I don't exceed the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US decision to reject the Kyoto Protocol has sparked moral and diplomatic tensions, particularly with Japan. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reefs dying, polar bears losing habitat, and birds migrating north, highlighting the urgency for global action. Japan, proud of its role in shaping the protocol, views the US stance as a betrayal, with environmental groups calling it "inadmissible" for the largest emitter to turn away. The clash over climate policy coincides with strained US-Japanese relations, as Washington's unilateralist approach, including its "do-it-our-way" attitude, has angered allies. Bush's alternative plan, which aims to reduce pollutants but allows emissions to increase, is criticized for failing to match Kyoto's rigor. Environmentalists fear this could lead to a two-tier system, harming global efforts. While Japanese industry claims it has implemented energy-saving measures, some argue further reductions could hurt competitiveness. The moral framing underscores the US's responsibility to consult and lead, not pull back, to prevent global harm. END OF SUMMARY.
