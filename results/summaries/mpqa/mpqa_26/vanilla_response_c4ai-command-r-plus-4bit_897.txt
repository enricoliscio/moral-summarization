SUMMARY: The decision by US President George Bush not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has caused irritation and indignation in Japan and among US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, was crafted in part to address Washington's concerns, and Japan took pride in its role as host of the negotiations. Bush's rejection of the accord in favor of a US-led alternative plan has been perceived as a unilateralist move by the US, acting without consulting its allies. Environmental advocates argue that the US plan will allow it to continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions and could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. This has raised concerns among Japanese environmental organizations and some industries that have already invested in energy-saving measures. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has expressed reservations about the US alternative, and there is a sense of disappointment in Japan over the US decision on an issue of global significance. This comes at a sensitive time in US-Japanese relations, as Japan's economic influence in Asia wanes and its post-9/11 support for the US-led war on terror has been downplayed. END OF SUMMARY.
