SUMMARY: The United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has irritated Japan and many US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, was shaped partially to address Washington's concerns, and Japan took pride in hosting the negotiations. Now, with the US backing out, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the accord and the potential for a two-tier system, with the US setting its own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. Environmental advocates argue that the US alternative plan will allow it to continue increasing its gas emissions and that this could lead to smaller nations backing out of the protocol. This has caused an air of indignation in Japan, with environmental groups expressing their disappointment and concern about the unilateral decision-making of the US. The Japanese government, however, is caught between its commitment to environmental protection and the potential impact on its industrial competitiveness. This issue has also brought to light shifting power dynamics in Asia and the potential decline in the importance of the US-Japan relationship. The article highlights the moral dilemma between economic interests and environmental responsibilities, with the US and its allies struggling to find a balance. END OF SUMMARY.
