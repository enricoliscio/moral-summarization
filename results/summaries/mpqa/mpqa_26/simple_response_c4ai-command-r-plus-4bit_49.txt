SUMMARY: With President George Bush's decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, Japan and other US allies are expressing irritation and indignation over Washington's unilateral decision-making. The Protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, aims to slow global warming and its devastating consequences on nature and wildlife. Japan took pride in hosting the agreement and saw it as proof of its relevance on the world stage. However, Bush's rejection of the Protocol and proposal of an alternative plan is causing concern among environmental advocates, who fear that other smaller nations may follow the US in backing out of the agreement. This could lead to a two-tier system with different emission targets for different countries. While some in Japan share concerns about the impact on industrial competitiveness, many are disappointed in the US's unilateral approach and its potential impact on global efforts to combat climate change. Mie Asaoka, president of the Kiko Network, an environmental organization in Tokyo, strongly criticizes the US's stance. This comes at a delicate time in US-Japanese relations, as Japan's economic dominance in Asia is diminishing, and the US is seen as acting first and consulting allies later. END OF SUMMARY.
