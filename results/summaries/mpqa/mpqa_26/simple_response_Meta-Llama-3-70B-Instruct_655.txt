SUMMARY:

The US refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Japan, with environmental groups and government officials criticizing the Bush administration's unilateral approach to climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the devastating effects of global warming, such as coral reef destruction, polar bear extinction, and bird migrations. Japan, a nation proud of its environmental record, feels betrayed by the US decision, which is seen as a "do-it-our-way" approach that disregards international cooperation. The US alternative plan is deemed insufficient, as it would allow the country to continue increasing gas emissions, potentially leading to a two-tier system where smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. The rift has strained US-Japan relations, with many seeing the US as increasingly unilateralist since the Sept. 11 attacks.
