SUMMARY:

The US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked frustration in Japan, a nation proud of its role in shaping the accord. Climate-change experts warn of dire consequences, including coral reef destruction, polar bear extinction, and bird migration disruptions, if global warming is not addressed. Japan's environmental groups are outraged, seeing the US's stance as unilateralist and detrimental to the global effort. The US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is criticized for allowing continued gas emission increases. Japan's industry, however, is more receptive to the US plan, citing existing energy-saving measures and concerns about competitiveness. The dispute occurs at a sensitive time in US-Japan relations, with Japan's economic influence waning and the US reevaluating its alliances. The rift may lead to a two-tier system, with the US and some allies setting their own targets, while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits.

END OF SUMMARY.
