SUMMARY:

Tokyo is irked by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow down global warming. The accord's effectiveness is in doubt after President George Bush refused to ratify it, despite the US being the greatest gas-emitting country. This decision is seen as a "do-it-our-way" approach, sparking indignation in Japan and among US allies. The clash over how to address global warming while allowing sluggish economies to prosper has led to a sense of unilateralism in Washington's actions. The US alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as inadequate by environmental advocates, who fear it will allow the US to increase gas emissions. This could lead to a two-tier system, where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's pride and sense of relevance on the world stage are hurt by the US decision, which is seen as a turning back on the Kyoto Protocol.
