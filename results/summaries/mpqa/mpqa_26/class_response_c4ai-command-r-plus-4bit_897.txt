SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies are expressing indignation over President George Bush's decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol, shaped during a 1997 meeting in Kyoto, was designed in part to address Washington's concerns. However, Bush has proposed an alternative plan, claiming that the Kyoto Protocol will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness and will not effectively reduce gas emissions. Environmental advocates and US allies are concerned that the US is acting unilaterally and without consultation, which may lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few other countries set their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. This clash over how to address global warming while considering economic prosperity has irritated Japan, a nation of nature lovers, as they feel that the US is turning its back on their efforts and presenting an inadmissible alternative. The article also highlights the diminishing importance of the US-Japan relationship as Japan's economic dominance in Asia wanes and the perception that the US is becoming increasingly unilateralist in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.
