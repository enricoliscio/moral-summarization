SUMMARY: Many countries, including Japan, are irritated by the United States' decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was signed by 150 countries in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, and was shaped in part to address Washington's concerns. However, President George Bush has recently stated that the US will not ratify the agreement, raising concerns among its allies about the US' unilateralist tendencies. Japan, a nation of nature lovers, takes pride in the fact that the protocol was shaped on their soil and sees the US' decision as a slight and a sign of disregard for a global issue. Environmental advocates fear that the US' alternative plan will allow it to continue increasing its gas emissions and that smaller nations may start backing out of the protocol, leading to a two-tier system. While some in Japan share concerns about the impact of further emission reductions on industrial competitiveness, others defend the protocol as a necessary step to stop global warming. Mie Asaoka, president of the Kiko Network, an environmental organization in Tokyo, presents a strong moral argument against the US' stance, saying that it is "absolutely inadmissible" for the US to turn its back on the global community and present an alternative that goes against the Kyoto Protocol.
