SUMMARY: The United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has irked Japan and many US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997 in Kyoto, was shaped in part to address Washington's concerns. However, with the US now turning its back on the agreement, there are concerns about its effectiveness in slowing global warming. The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing economies to prosper occurs at an awkward time in US-Japanese relations, with Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishing. The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, but environmental advocates fear that it will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions and that smaller nations may start backing out of the protocol, leading to a two-tier system. Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush's alternative, as some argue that further emission reduction policies will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness. Japan, a nation of nature lovers, takes pride in the shaping of the accord on their soil and sees the US decision as a unilateralist move that affects the whole globe.
END OF SUMMARY.
