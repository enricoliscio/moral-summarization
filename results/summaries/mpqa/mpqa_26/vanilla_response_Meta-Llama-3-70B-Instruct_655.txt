SUMMARY:

The US's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Japan, with environmental groups and government officials criticizing the move as "inadmissible" and "unilateralist". The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is particularly upset as it was a key player in shaping the accord. The US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as too lenient and may lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to stricter Kyoto limits. Japanese industry, however, is more supportive of the US alternative, citing concerns over competitiveness. The dispute has added to tensions in US-Japan relations, which are already strained due to Japan's diminishing economic dominance in Asia.

END OF SUMMARY.
