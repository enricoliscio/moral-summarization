Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol and how it's affecting relations with Japan. I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the environmental concerns and the frustration from US allies.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the potential consequences of global warming, the importance of the Kyoto Protocol, and the US decision not to ratify it. Japan is upset because they were instrumental in creating the protocol. There's also mention of Bush's alternative plan, which isn't as strict, and how this might cause a two-tier system.

I need to highlight the moral implications. The US's refusal to ratify Kyoto is seen as a betrayal, especially since they were involved in shaping it. Japan feels this undermines their efforts and the global fight against climate change. Also, the article mentions that smaller nations might follow the US, leading to a less effective system.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the US stance, Japan's reaction, the environmental consequences, and the impact on international cooperation. I'll make sure to include the moral judgment against the US's unilateral decision.

Let me structure it: start with the US decision, its impact on the Kyoto Protocol, Japan's pride and frustration, the consequences of global warming, the alternative plan's criticism, and the potential two-tier system. Also, mention the business perspective but keep it brief.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all these aspects without being too detailed. I'll avoid technical jargon to keep it clear and accessible. Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked frustration in Japan and among its allies, who view it as a betrayal of global efforts to combat climate change. The protocol, shaped in part to address US concerns, was a source of pride for Japan, which played a key role in its creation. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reef death, polar bear decline, and disrupted bird migration due to global warming. The US's alternative plan, which critics argue allows continued greenhouse gas increases, has raised fears of a two-tier system where some nations set their own targets while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. Japan, a nation emphasizing environmental action, is particularly angered by the US's unilateral approach, seen as undermining global cooperation. While some Japanese industries argue further emission cuts could harm competitiveness, many view the US stance as a step backward in the fight against climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
