SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies express dismay at President George Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to combat climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. Bush's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as less effective by environmental advocates. They worry that the US's unilateral decision-making could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. This has caused irritation in Japan, where the protocol was shaped and where it is seen as a source of pride and a sign of their relevance on the world stage. Japanese industry, however, is concerned that further emission reduction policies could hurt their competitiveness. The article also discusses the impact of global warming and the clash between economic prosperity and environmental protection. It mentions the potential consequences for nature, such as the death of coral reefs and the displacement of polar bears and birds. The author suggests that the US-Japan relationship is at an awkward point, with some analysts predicting a decrease in Japan's economic dominance and the importance of their alliance.
END OF SUMMARY.
