SUMMARY: The United States' decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has caused irritation and indignation in Japan and among other US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, was crafted in part to address Washington's concerns, but President George Bush has nonetheless rejected it. This has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the accord and has been interpreted as a sign of America's growing unilateralism in the post-9/11 era. Japanese environmentalists and nature-lovers express outrage at the US' disregard for a global issue, while some Japanese industries fear that further emission reduction policies will hurt their competitiveness. The article highlights the clash between environmental concerns and economic interests, with Japan caught between its desire to preserve its relevance on the world stage and the potential economic impact of emission reduction efforts. Bush administration proposes its own alternative plan, but it is criticized for allowing the US to continue increasing its gas emissions, potentially leading to a two-tier system with looser standards for some countries. This complex situation underscores the challenges of addressing global warming while balancing economic considerations. END OF SUMMARY.
