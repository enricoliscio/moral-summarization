SUMMARY:

The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked irritation in Tokyo, with Japan's environmental groups and government expressing disappointment and frustration. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, but President George Bush has refused to ratify it. Japan, a nation proud of its environmental efforts, feels the US is turning its back on the accord. The clash comes at a sensitive time in US-Japan relations, with Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishing and the US-Japan relationship being reevaluated. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has gently balked at the US's alternative plan, which environmental advocates say will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions. The US's unilateral approach has raised concerns among its allies, who fear it may lead to a two-tier system where some countries choose their own targets while others are bound by stricter Kyoto limits.
