SUMMARY:

The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked irritation among its allies, particularly in Japan, where the accord was shaped and signed in 1997. The protocol aims to slow global warming, which experts warn will have dire consequences, such as coral reef destruction, polar bear extinction, and bird starvation. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels the US is turning its back on the protocol and presenting an alternative that undermines the framework convention on climate change. This unilateralist decision has led to a sense of indignation in Japan, with many seeing it as a signal that Washington is growing increasingly unilateralist. The US alternative plan, Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is deemed insufficient by environmental advocates, who fear it will allow the US to continue increasing gas emissions, leading to a two-tier system where smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol.
