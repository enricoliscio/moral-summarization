SUMMARY:
The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Japan, with environmental groups calling it "inadmissible" for the world's largest gas-emitting country to reject the accord. The decision has been met with "indignation" in Japan, a nation of nature-lovers who take "pride" in their environmental efforts. The clash comes at an "awkward" point in US-Japan relations, with some analysts predicting a decline in the importance of the relationship. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has expressed disappointment with the US alternative, saying Japan would "like to see further efforts" from the US. The Bush administration's decision is seen as part of a growing trend of "unilateralist" behavior, sparking "fear" that smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. END OF SUMMARY.
