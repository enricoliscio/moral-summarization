Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Tokyo's reaction to the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol. Let me read through the article first to get a good understanding.

The article starts by talking about the dire consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing their habitat. It mentions that 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, but now the US, under President George Bush, isn't ratifying it. This is causing issues because the US is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Japan, which was proud to host the Kyoto talks, is upset because they see the US's decision as ignoring their global responsibilities.

There's also some context about US-Japanese relations. The US's economic influence in Asia is declining, and Japan is trying to assert itself more on the global stage. The article mentions a slight where the US didn't include Japan in their list of contributors to the war on terror, but later apologized. During Bush's visit, Koizumi didn't agree with the alternative plan Bush proposed, saying Japan wanted more effort from the US.

The article then talks about the Bush administration's alternative plan, which is more market-focused and aims to reduce pollutants but not greenhouse gases as strictly as Kyoto. Environmental groups are worried this will lead to a two-tier system where some countries have looser targets, and others stick to Kyoto. However, some in Japan, like the business lobby, support this because they think it won't hurt their industry as much.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the main points: the US not ratifying Kyoto, Japan's frustration, the impact on global efforts, the alternative plan, and the differing opinions in Japan.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the US's decision, then Japan's reaction, mention the potential consequences, the alternative plan, and the internal debate in Japan. Keep it concise but cover all key aspects.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Tokyo's frustration with the U.S. decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a global climate agreement. The U.S. stance has raised concerns about the protocol's effectiveness and strained relations with allies, particularly Japan, which was proud to host the Kyoto talks. Environmental groups criticize the U.S. alternative plan, which focuses on market-driven solutions and aims to reduce pollutants but not greenhouse gases as strictly as Kyoto. They fear this could lead to a two-tier system, with some countries opting out of Kyoto. Meanwhile, Japan's industry argues that further emission reductions could harm its competitiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
