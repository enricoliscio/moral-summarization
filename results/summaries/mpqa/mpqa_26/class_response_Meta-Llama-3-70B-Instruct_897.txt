SUMMARY:

Tokyo is irked by the US stance on Kyoto, which may lead to dire consequences such as coral reefs dying, polar bears being crowded out of existence, and birds starving. The US refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, shaped in part to fit Washington's concerns, is seen as a unilateralist move, sparking a clash over how to stop global warming while allowing economies to prosper. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is proud of its role in shaping the accord and feels the US is turning its back on the protocol. The US alternative plan is seen as a "do-it-our-way" decision, which may lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. Environmental advocates fear the US plan will allow it to increase gas emissions, hurting the planet. Japan's industry, however, is not upset, having already implemented energy-saving drives. The US move is seen as a signal of growing unilateralism, sparking indignation in Japan and among US allies.

END OF SUMMARY.
