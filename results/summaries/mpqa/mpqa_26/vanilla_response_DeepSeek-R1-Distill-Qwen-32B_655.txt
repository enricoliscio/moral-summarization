Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's stance on it. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about the dire consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. It mentions that 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, but now the US isn't ratifying it, which is causing issues. Japan is particularly upset because they were proud to host the agreement and felt it was a significant step. The US's decision is making many allies, including Japan, irritated.

There's a quote from Mie Asaoka, an environmental leader in Japan, criticizing the US for not ratifying the protocol. The article also touches on the tension between the US and Japan, especially regarding their economic and political relationships. The US's actions are seen as unilateral, which is a concern for allies.

The Bush administration proposed an alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which they say will reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas intensity. However, environmental groups argue this plan allows the US to keep emitting more gases and could lead to a two-tier system where some countries follow Kyoto and others don't. Japan's industry is more concerned about their competitiveness if they have to reduce emissions further.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely. I should mention the US's withdrawal from Kyoto, Japan's irritation, the potential consequences, the alternative plan, and the differing opinions in Japan. Also, note the impact on global efforts and the concern about other countries following the US's lead.

Let me structure this: start with the US's decision, Japan's reaction, the implications for global efforts, the alternative plan, and the internal debate in Japan. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: The US decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol has caused significant irritation in Japan, a country proud of its role in shaping the agreement. Climate experts warn of severe consequences like coral reef death and polar bear habitat loss due to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but its effectiveness is now uncertain as the US, the largest emitter, refuses to ratify it. Japan views this as a blow to global efforts and its own relevance in international affairs. Environmental groups criticize the Bush administration's alternative plan, which they argue allows continued emissions and risks a two-tier system. While Japanese industry supports energy-saving measures, some worry further emission reductions could harm competitiveness. The US's unilateral approach has raised concerns among allies about a shift toward isolationism. END OF SUMMARY.
