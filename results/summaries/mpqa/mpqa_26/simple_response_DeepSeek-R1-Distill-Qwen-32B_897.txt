Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol irritating Tokyo. It mentions the dire consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 by 150 countries, but the US under President Bush refused to ratify it. Japan, being a nature-loving country, felt proud and relevant after shaping the Kyoto Protocol on their soil. They're upset that the US, the biggest emitter, is not supporting it.

There's a clash between stopping global warming and economic growth, especially in the context of US-Japanese relations. The US is seen as becoming more unilateral, especially after September 11. The Bush administration's alternative plan is criticized for allowing increased emissions and potentially causing a two-tier system where some countries have looser targets.

However, not everyone in Japan is against this. Japanese industry argues they've already made efforts to save energy and reducing emissions further could hurt their competitiveness.

I need to capture the moral issues here: US's refusal to ratify Kyoto, the impact on global efforts, Japan's pride and irritation, the potential for a two-tier system, and industry's concerns.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, making sure to include the moral framing about the US's role and the global implications.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and political tensions surrounding the US's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, irritating Japan and other allies. The protocol, seen as a global effort to combat climate change, was a source of pride for Japan, which played a key role in shaping it. The US's decision to reject it, despite being the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is viewed as unilateral and harmful to global efforts. Environmental groups criticize the US's alternative plan as insufficient, potentially leading to a two-tier system where some countries set looser targets. While Japanese industry argues further emission reductions could harm competitiveness, many see the US's stance as undermining international cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
