SUMMARY:

The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Japan, with environmental groups and government officials alike condemning the move as "inadmissible" and "unilateralist". The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, which poses dire consequences such as coral reef destruction, polar bear extinction, and bird migration disruptions. Japan, a nation proud of its nature-loving reputation, feels betrayed by the US decision, especially since the protocol was shaped in part to accommodate Washington's concerns. The move is seen as part of a growing trend of US unilateralism, which could lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to stricter Kyoto limits. Japanese industry, however, is more supportive of the US alternative, citing concerns about competitiveness.

END OF SUMMARY.
