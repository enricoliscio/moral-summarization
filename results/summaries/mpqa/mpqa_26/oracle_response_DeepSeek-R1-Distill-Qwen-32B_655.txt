Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used that carry moral connotations. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the morally charged words.

The article talks about the US not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, which is causing irritation among allies, especially Japan. The moral words here include "signed," "ratify," "irritated," "turn," "present," etc. I should make sure to include these in the summary.

I should start by mentioning the Kyoto Protocol and the US's stance. Then, highlight Japan's pride in the agreement and their disappointment. Include the environmental consequences and the criticism of the US's unilateral approach. Also, mention the alternative plan proposed by the US and the concerns about its effectiveness.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows well. Let me structure it by first introducing the issue, then the impact on US-Japan relations, the environmental implications, and the reactions from different groups in Japan.

Make sure to include words like "irritated," "unilateralist," "pulling out," "forging," etc., to maintain the moral tone. Also, note the cartoon metaphor to emphasize the perceived threat from the US's decision.

Finally, wrap it up by mentioning the potential consequences if other countries follow the US's lead, affecting global efforts against climate change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and political tensions surrounding the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, irritating its allies, especially Japan. Signed in 1997, the protocol aimed to combat global warming, but President George Bush's stance has cast doubt on its effectiveness. Japan, proud of its role in shaping the accord, criticizes the US for turning its back on a global commitment, calling it "inadmissible" for the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Environmentalists fear the US's unilateral approach, exemplified by its alternative plan, could weaken global efforts and lead to a two-tier system. Meanwhile, US allies see a growing trend of unilateralism, with critics labeling the administration as acting first and consulting later. While some in Japan, like industry representatives, argue that further emissions reductions could hurt competitiveness, others express indignation over the US's "do-it-our-way" decision. The article underscores the clash between global responsibility and national interests, with the US's decision seen as a setback for international cooperation in addressing climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
