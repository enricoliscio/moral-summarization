Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's stance on it, specifically how Japan is upset because the US isn't ratifying it. 

Okay, the main points are: the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997, aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. The US, under Bush, decided not to ratify it, which is causing irritation among allies, especially Japan. Japan was proud of hosting the talks and sees this as a setback. 

There's also mention of the environmental consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. The US has an alternative plan, Clear Skies, which critics say won't reduce emissions enough. Environmental groups are worried that other countries might follow the US and not ratify Kyoto, leading to a two-tier system.

Additionally, the article touches on US-Japan relations and how the US's actions are seen as unilateral, affecting their partnership. Japanese industry is against stricter measures because they've already made efforts and don't want to hurt their competitiveness.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the US's decision to not ratify Kyoto, the impact on Japan, the environmental concerns, the alternative plan, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to mention the bilateral relations aspect and the industry perspective briefly.

Let me structure it: introduce the US stance, Japan's reaction, environmental implications, the alternative plan, concerns about other countries, and the industry viewpoint. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, causing irritation among its allies, particularly Japan. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the US's refusal to ratify it has raised concerns about its effectiveness. Japan, which hosted the talks, is particularly upset, as it sees the protocol as a symbol of global cooperation. Environmentalists warn of dire consequences like coral reef death and polar bear habitat loss due to global warming. The US proposes an alternative plan, Clear Skies, which critics argue won't sufficiently reduce emissions. Allies fear this could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and others setting their own targets while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. Japanese industry, already energy-efficient, opposes further reductions, fearing harm to competitiveness. The US's unilateral stance has strained relations with Japan, highlighting a broader trend of US unilateralism post-9/11. END OF SUMMARY.
