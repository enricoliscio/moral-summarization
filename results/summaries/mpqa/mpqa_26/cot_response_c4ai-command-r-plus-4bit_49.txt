SUMMARY:
Japan is irked by the US decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was shaped in part to address Washington's concerns, and its signing in Tokyo was a source of pride for the Japanese, who saw it as proof of their relevance on the world stage. Environmental advocates in Japan and elsewhere are outraged by the US decision, viewing it as a unilateral move that undermines global efforts to tackle climate change. The Bush administration's alternative plan is seen as less ambitious and may allow the US to continue increasing its greenhouse gas emissions. There is a fear that this could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. While some in Japan share concerns about the economic impact of the protocol on their country's industries, many see the US move as a slight and a hurtful act against the global effort to address climate change.
