Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and how that's affecting relations with Japan and other countries.

The author uses specific morally charged words like "die," "shaping," "turn," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The article talks about the environmental consequences of global warming and how the US's stance is causing irritation among allies, especially Japan.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the US and its allies, the environmental impacts, and the implications of the US's unilateral decision. I'll mention the potential consequences of global warming, the significance of the Kyoto Protocol, and the US's alternative plan which others see as insufficient.

I also need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally. Let me start by outlining the key points: environmental consequences, the Kyoto Protocol, US refusal, Japan's pride and irritation, the impact on US-Japan relations, the alternative plan, and the potential for a two-tier system.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring I include the morally framed words and keep it concise. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Let me make sure each sentence captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it maintains the moral tone and includes all necessary points. I think that's a solid approach to crafting the required summary.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and environmental implications of the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which was shaped to address global warming. Coral reefs dying, polar bears losing habitat, and birds migrating north are dire consequences of rising temperatures. The Kyoto Protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aimed to slow this process, but President George Bush's refusal to ratify it has caused irritation among US allies, particularly Japan. For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the protocol was a source of pride and proof of its global relevance. Mie Asaoka of the Kiko Network condemns the US, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, for turning its back on the agreement. The clash over climate policy coincides with strained US-Japanese relations, as Japan's economic dominance in Asia wanes. Bush's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as insufficient by environmental advocates, potentially allowing the US to increase emissions. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has expressed concern, while some in Japanese industry argue further emissions reductions could hurt competitiveness. The Bush administration's unilateral approach, including pulling out of Kyoto and labeling Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as threats, has alarmed allies, who fear a two-tier system where some nations set their own targets while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. END OF SUMMARY.
