SUMMARY:

Tokyo is irritated by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to stop global warming. The protocol's effectiveness is in doubt after President George Bush said the US will not ratify it, despite being shaped to fit Washington's concerns. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is proud of its role in shaping the accord and feels the US is turning its back on the agreement. The US alternative plan, Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as unilateralist and may lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others choose their own targets, while the rest of the world follows stricter Kyoto limits. Environmental advocates fear this will allow the US to continue increasing gas emissions, hurting the global effort to stop global warming. Japan's industry is concerned that further emission reductions will hurt their competitiveness. The US decision is seen as part of a growing trend of unilateralism since the Sept. 11 attacks.
