SUMMARY:

Tokyo is irritated by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to stop global warming. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, is in doubt after President George Bush said the US will not ratify it. This decision is seen as unilateralist and has sparked indignation in Japan, a nation of nature-lovers who take pride in shaping the accord on their soil. Environmental advocates say Bush's alternative plan will allow the US to continue increasing gas emissions, which could lead to a two-tier system where smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. The US is seen as turning its back on the protocol and presenting something that is against the framework convention on climate change. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi gently balked at Bush's proposed alternative, saying Japan would "like to see further efforts" from the US. The US is growing increasingly unilateralist, acting first and consulting later, which is causing friction in US-Japanese relations.

END OF SUMMARY.
