SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies express irritation and indignation over President George Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to combat climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. Bush's decision comes as a blow to Japan, which took pride in hosting the negotiations and saw it as a sign of their relevance on the world stage. Environmental groups in Japan criticize the US for acting unilaterally and propose that their alternative plan will allow for increased emissions. Japanese industry, however, is relieved as they believe further emission reductions could hurt their competitiveness. The US decision has sparked concerns about a potential two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. This situation occurs at a delicate time in US-Japanese relations, with some analysts suggesting that Japan's economic dominance in Asia is waning, impacting the importance of their relationship with the US.
END OF SUMMARY.
