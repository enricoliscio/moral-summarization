Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's decision not to ratify it, causing irritation among allies, especially Japan. The author uses words like "signed," "ratify," "irritated," "unilateralist," etc., which carry moral connotations.

I should focus on the key points: the environmental consequences of global warming, the importance of the Kyoto Protocol, the US's stance, Japan's reaction, and the potential consequences of the US's decision.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to highlight the US's refusal, Japan's pride in the protocol, the moral implications of the US's actions, and the concerns about global cooperation.

Let me start by outlining the main sections: introduction of the problem, the Kyoto Protocol's creation, US refusal, Japan's reaction, the impact on US-Japan relations, the Bush administration's alternative plan, and the potential fallout.

I should keep each sentence concise, using the specified words where appropriate. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the moral framing elements.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political implications of the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, irritating its allies, particularly Japan. Signed in 1997, the protocol aimed to address global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, President George Bush's refusal to ratify it has raised concerns about the US's commitment to international cooperation. Japan, proud of its role in shaping the protocol, views the US's stance as irresponsible, given its status as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Environmental groups criticize the Bush administration's alternative plan, which they argue allows the US to continue increasing emissions while other nations face stricter limits. This could lead to a two-tier system, undermining global efforts to combat climate change. Meanwhile, some in Japan argue that further emissions reductions could harm industrial competitiveness. The US's unilateral approach has strained relations with allies, highlighting a growing trend of acting without consulting others. END OF SUMMARY.
