SUMMARY:
The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked indignation in Japan, with many viewing it as an "inadmissible" move by the world's greatest gas-emitting country. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, but President George Bush's refusal to ratify it has put its effectiveness in doubt. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels proud of its role in shaping the accord and is upset by the US's "do-it-our-way" decision. Environmental advocates argue that the US's alternative plan will allow it to continue increasing gas emissions, leading to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. This has raised concerns about the US's growing unilateralist tendencies, with many seeing it as a signal that Washington is increasingly acting first and consulting later. END OF SUMMARY.
