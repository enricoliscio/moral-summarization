SUMMARY:

The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Japan, with many seeing it as a unilateralist move by the Bush administration. Climate experts warn of dire consequences, including the death of coral reefs, polar bears, and birds, if global warming is not slowed. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is particularly irked, having hosted the signing of the protocol in 1997. The country's environmental groups and government officials are criticizing the US for not ratifying the agreement, which was shaped to fit Washington's concerns. The US alternative plan is seen as inadequate, allowing the country to continue increasing its gas emissions. This has led to fears of a two-tier system, where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's economic and environmental concerns are at odds, with industry groups warning that further emission reductions will hurt competitiveness.
