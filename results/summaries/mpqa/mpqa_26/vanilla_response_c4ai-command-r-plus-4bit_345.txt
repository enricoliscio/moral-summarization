SUMMARY: The United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has irritated Japan and many US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, was crafted in part to address Washington's concerns. However, with the US backing out, the effectiveness of the accord is now in question. Japan, a nation of nature lovers, takes pride in the fact that the protocol was shaped on their soil and sees it as proof of their relevance on the world stage. Environmental advocates in Japan express strong disapproval of the US decision, arguing that it will allow the US to continue increasing its greenhouse gas emissions and could lead to a two-tier system with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. Japanese industry representatives, on the other hand, express concerns that further emission reduction policies will hurt their competitiveness. The US, meanwhile, has proposed its own alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which aims to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas intensity but is seen by critics as less stringent than the Kyoto Protocol. The clash over how to balance economic interests with the need to address global warming occurs at a time when the importance of the US-Japan relationship is perceived to be diminishing.
