SUMMARY:
The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Tokyo, with environmental groups calling President George Bush's decision not to ratify the accord "absolutely inadmissible". The move has been seen as a "slight" to Japan, which takes pride in having shaped the accord on its soil. The clash over how to address global warming has come at an awkward point in US-Japan relations, with some analysts predicting a decline in Japan's economic dominance in Asia. Environmental advocates have expressed indignation over the Bush administration's "do-it-our-way" approach, fearing it will lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. The Japanese government has been left feeling frustrated, with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi gently rebuking Bush's proposed alternative. END OF SUMMARY.
