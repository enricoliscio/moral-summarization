SUMMARY:

The US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change has sparked frustration in Japan and other US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is particularly upset as it was a key player in shaping the accord. Environmental groups in Japan argue that the US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, will allow the country to continue increasing its gas emissions. This could lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world follows stricter Kyoto limits. The dispute comes at a sensitive time in US-Japan relations, with some analysts predicting a decline in the importance of the relationship as Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes.
