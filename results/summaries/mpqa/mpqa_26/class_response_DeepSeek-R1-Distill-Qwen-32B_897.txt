Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's decision not to ratify it, which is causing irritation among US allies, especially Japan. Japan was proud of shaping the protocol and sees the US's stance as a betrayal. There are environmental consequences mentioned, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. The article also touches on the US's unilateral actions post-9/11, which is causing concern among allies. Additionally, there's a mention of the Bush administration's alternative plan, which environmentalists criticize as not being sufficient.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: die, shaping, turn, clash, attacks, pulling, labeling, consult, reduce, finding, increase, implemented, hurt. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral implications, such as the US turning away from the protocol, the clash between economic growth and environmental action, the attacks on global warming, etc.

I'll start by stating the US's decision not to ratify Kyoto, causing irritation. Then mention Japan's pride in shaping the protocol and the environmental consequences. Highlight the clash over stopping global warming while allowing economies to grow. Include the attacks on the US's stance, pulling out of Kyoto, labeling countries as evil. Note the Bush administration's alternative plan and how it's seen as allowing emissions to increase. Also, mention how this might hurt Japan's industrial competitiveness. Finally, touch on the potential for a two-tier system and the moral implications of the US's actions.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points with the moral framing words. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: The US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has irked its allies, particularly Japan, which took pride in shaping the accord. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat due to global warming. The clash between slowing climate change and economic growth is evident, with the US's "do-it-our-way" approach causing indignation. The Bush administration's alternative plan, while aiming to reduce pollutants, is criticized for allowing emissions to increase, potentially harming Japan's industrial competitiveness. Allies see the US as growing unilateral, pulling out of Kyoto and labeling countries as part of an "axis of evil." This could lead to a two-tier system, where some nations, including the US, set their own targets, while others adhere to stricter Kyoto limits. Environmental advocates fear this will hurt global efforts to combat climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
