SUMMARY: Japan and many US allies are irritated by President George Bush's decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming. The protocol was shaped to address Washington's concerns, and the US's refusal to commit to it has raised concerns about American unilateralism. Climate-change experts warn of dire consequences of global warming, such as the death of coral reefs and the displacement of polar bears. Bush's decision comes at an awkward time in US-Japanese relations, as Japan's economic dominance in Asia is diminishing, and there is a perception that the US is acting first and consulting allies later. Environmental advocates fear that the US's decision to forge its own path on emissions reduction could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and a few other countries setting their own targets while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. While some Japanese industries are concerned about the impact of emissions reduction on their competitiveness, Japanese environmental groups and nature-lovers see the US decision as a turn against global efforts to address climate change. Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, has gently balked at Bush's proposed alternative to the Kyoto agreement, calling for further efforts from the US.
END OF SUMMARY.
