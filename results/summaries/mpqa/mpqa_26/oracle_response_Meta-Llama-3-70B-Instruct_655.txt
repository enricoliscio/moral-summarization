SUMMARY:

The US's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has irritated Japan and other US allies, who see it as a unilateralist decision that ignores the global consequences of climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, which threatens coral reefs, polar bears, and birds. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels particularly slighted, as the accord was shaped on their soil. Environmental advocates argue that the US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, will allow the country to continue increasing its gas emissions, leading to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world follows stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's industry, however, is not entirely opposed to the US's alternative, citing concerns about industrial competitiveness. The decision has sparked indignation in Japan, with many seeing it as a "do-it-our-way" approach that undermines global cooperation. END OF SUMMARY.
