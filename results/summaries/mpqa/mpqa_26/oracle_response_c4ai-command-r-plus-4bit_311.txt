SUMMARY: The United States' decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has irritated Japan and many US allies. The protocol, signed in 1997 on Japanese soil, was intended to slow global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, President George Bush has proposed an alternative plan, claiming that the Kyoto agreement would hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness. This decision has been viewed as a unilateral move by the US, with many allies seeing it as a sign of Washington's growing unilateralism in the six months since the Sept. 11 attacks. Environmental advocates fear that the US's actions could lead to a two-tier system, where the US and a few other countries set their own targets, while the rest of the world adheres to the stricter Kyoto limits. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, takes pride in hosting the signing of the protocol and views the US's decision as a slight and a turn against their efforts to combat climate change. The article also highlights the clash between economic concerns and environmental protection, with some Japanese industries expressing concern that further emission reduction policies will hurt their competitiveness. Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has gently balked at Bush's alternative proposal, calling for further efforts from the US to address global warming.
