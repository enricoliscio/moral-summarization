Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the US not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and the reactions from Japan and other countries. The author used specific morally charged words like "die," "clash," "attacks," etc., and I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The Kyoto Protocol was signed to address global warming, but the US under Bush refused to ratify it. Japan, which was proud of hosting the protocol, is upset. The US proposed an alternative plan, but environmental groups say it won't reduce emissions enough. There's tension in US-Japan relations, and some in Japan support the US's approach, especially industries that don't want stricter regulations.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, using as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll start by mentioning the US's refusal to ratify Kyoto, the consequences of global warming, Japan's pride in the protocol, the Bush administration's alternative plan, the criticism from environmentalists, and the differing opinions in Japan.

I should ensure that words like "die," "clash," "attacks," "pulling," "labeling," "reduce," "implemented," and "hurt" are included. I'll structure the summary to flow from the US's stance, Japan's reaction, the alternative plan, criticism, and the internal debate in Japan.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all necessary moral framing words without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The US's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has caused significant concern, particularly in Japan, which took pride in shaping the accord. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat due to global warming. The Bush administration's decision to pull out of Kyoto and propose an alternative plan, which critics argue will allow increased gas emissions, has clashed with international efforts. Environmental advocates fear this could lead to a two-tier system, with the US and some allies choosing their own targets while others adhere to stricter limits. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels the US, as the largest emitter, should lead by example. While some Japanese industries argue further emission reductions could hurt their competitiveness, many allies view the US's unilateral approach as a departure from global consultation. The decision has added tension to US-Japanese relations, highlighting a growing trend of unilateralism in US foreign policy. END OF SUMMARY.
