SUMMARY:

Tokyo is irked by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to slow global warming. The protocol's effectiveness is in doubt after President George Bush refused to ratify it, despite the US being the greatest gas-emitting country. This "do-it-our-way" decision has sparked indignation in Japan, with environmental advocates labeling it as "inadmissible". The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing economies to prosper has strained US-Japanese relations. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, feels the US is turning its back on the protocol, which was shaped in part to fit Washington's concerns. The US alternative plan, Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as a unilateralist move, allowing the US to increase gas emissions while smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. This could lead to a two-tier system, where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits.

END OF SUMMARY.
