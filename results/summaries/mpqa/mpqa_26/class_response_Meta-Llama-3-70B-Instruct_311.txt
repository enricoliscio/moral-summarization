SUMMARY:

The US stance on the Kyoto Protocol has sparked outrage in Tokyo, with environmental groups and government officials alike condemning President George Bush's decision not to ratify the accord. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, which threatens to "die" coral reefs, "crowd out" polar bears, and disrupt bird migrations. Japan, a nation of "nature-lovers," takes pride in having shaped the accord on its soil, and sees the US's rejection as a "clash" of values. The US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as a unilateral move that will allow the US to "increase" its gas emissions, while smaller nations may "turn" their backs on the Kyoto Protocol. Environmental advocates fear this will lead to a "two-tier" system, where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. The US's decision is seen as part of a growing trend of "unilateralism" since the Sept. 11 "attacks." END OF SUMMARY.
