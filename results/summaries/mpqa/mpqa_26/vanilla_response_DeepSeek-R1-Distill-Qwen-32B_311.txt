Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about Tokyo being upset with the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol. It mentions the possible consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 by 150 countries, but the US under George Bush isn't ratifying it. Japan is particularly annoyed because they helped shape the protocol and see it as a point of pride.

The article also discusses the impact on US-Japanese relations. Japan's economic influence in Asia is declining, and the US's actions, like not ratifying Kyoto, are making them look unilateral. The Bush administration has an alternative plan, but environmental groups say it won't reduce emissions enough and might cause other countries to back out of Kyoto.

Some in Japan, like the business lobby, don't mind the alternative because they've already made efforts to save energy. But overall, there's a sense of indignation in Japan over the US's decision.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: US refusal to ratify Kyoto, Japan's frustration, the potential impact on international cooperation, and the alternative plan's criticisms. I should also mention the business perspective briefly.

Let me structure it: start with the US stance, Japan's reaction, the consequences for global efforts, the alternative plan, and the mixed reactions in Japan. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the tension between the US and Japan over the Kyoto Protocol, with Japan expressing frustration over the US's decision not to ratify the agreement. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but President George Bush's refusal to support it has cast doubt on its effectiveness and irritated US allies, including Japan. Japan, which played a key role in shaping the protocol, sees this decision as a blow to global efforts against climate change. Environmental groups criticize the Bush administration's alternative plan, which they argue allows the US to continue increasing emissions and risks creating a two-tier system where some countries adhere to stricter limits while others, like the US, set their own targets. While some in Japan, such as the business lobby, argue that further emission reductions could harm industrial competitiveness, there is widespread concern that the US's unilateral stance could undermine international cooperation on climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
