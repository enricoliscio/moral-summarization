SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies express irritation and indignation over President George Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to combat climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. Environmental experts warn of dire consequences if action is not taken, such as the death of coral reefs and the displacement of polar bears. Bush's decision to propose an alternative plan is seen as a unilateral move by the US, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol and creating a two-tier system with looser emissions targets for the US and a few other countries. Japanese environmental groups and citizens are critical of the US stance, while some in the Japanese industry express concern that further emissions reductions could hurt their competitiveness. This clash over global warming efforts comes at a sensitive time in US-Japanese relations, with Japan's economic influence in Asia waning and the US perceived as acting increasingly unilaterally in the post-9/11 era. Japan's efforts to support the war on terror, including altering its pacifist constitution, have been overlooked by the US, adding to the sense of frustration in Tokyo.
END OF SUMMARY.
