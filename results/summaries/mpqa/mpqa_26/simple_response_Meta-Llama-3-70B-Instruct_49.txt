SUMMARY:

The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change has sparked outrage in Japan and among other US allies. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming, which threatens coral reefs, polar bears, and birds. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, is particularly upset, as the accord was shaped on their soil and is seen as proof of their relevance on the world stage. The US alternative plan, which allows for increased gas emissions, is seen as a unilateralist move, ignoring the concerns of other nations. Environmental advocates fear this could lead to a two-tier system, where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's industry, however, is more open to the US alternative, citing concerns about competitiveness.

END OF SUMMARY.
