SUMMARY: Japan and other US allies are expressing outrage at President George Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement to combat climate change. The protocol, signed by 150 countries in 1997, aims to slow global warming and its devastating consequences, such as the death of coral reefs and the displacement of polar bears. Bush's decision to propose an alternative plan that is seen as less stringent and more favorable to the US economy has irritated allies, who view it as a unilateral move that undermines global efforts to tackle climate change. Japanese environmental groups and citizens are particularly dismayed, as the protocol was shaped with input from Washington and signed in their country. They see the US decision as a disregard for the global good and a potential threat to the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol. While some Japanese industries are concerned about the economic impact of emission reduction policies, many believe that the US should take more responsibility as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. This incident adds to the perception that the US is becoming increasingly unilateralist in its foreign policy decisions, acting in its own self-interest rather than consulting and cooperating with allies.
