SUMMARY: Japan is irritated by the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1997 to combat global warming. President George Bush has saying that the US will not ratify the protocol, despite the efforts of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to present an alternative plan. This decision has been seen by many as a unilateralist move by the US, and a slight to Japan, which is a key ally in the war on terror. Environmental advocates fear that the US is overlooking the potential consequences of global warming and that by forging its own way, the US may hurt the efforts of smaller nations to reduce emissions. There is concern that the US decision could lead to a two-tier system, in which the US and a few other countries choose their own targets, while the rest of the world is limited to the stricter Kyoto limits. This has created an air of indignation in Japan, with some seeing the US as presenting an inadmissible alternative that goes against the global effort to stop climate change.
END OF SUMMARY.
