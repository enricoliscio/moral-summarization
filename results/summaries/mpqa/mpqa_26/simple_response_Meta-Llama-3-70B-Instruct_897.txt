SUMMARY:

The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change has sparked outrage in Japan, with many seeing it as a unilateralist move by the Bush administration. Environmental experts warn of dire consequences, including the death of coral reefs, loss of polar bear habitats, and disruptions to bird migrations. Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, takes pride in having hosted the Kyoto Protocol's creation and views the US stance as "inadmissible." The clash occurs at a sensitive time in US-Japan relations, with Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishing and the US-Japan relationship potentially losing importance. While the US offers an alternative plan, environmental advocates fear it will allow the US to increase gas emissions, potentially leading to a two-tier system where smaller nations may back out of the Kyoto Protocol. Japan's business lobby, however, sees the US alternative as a more market-friendly approach.

END OF SUMMARY.
