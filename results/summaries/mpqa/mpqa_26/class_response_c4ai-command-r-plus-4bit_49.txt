SUMMARY: The United States' decision to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at combating global warming, has irritated Japan and many US allies. The protocol, shaped during a 1997 meeting in Kyoto, was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down global warming. Climate-change experts warn that global warming can lead to dire consequences such as the death of coral reefs and the displacement of polar bears. Despite Japan's pride in hosting the agreement and its efforts to reduce emissions, the US has proposed an alternative plan, citing concerns about the impact on sluggish economies. Environmental advocates criticize the US plan, arguing that it will allow the US to continue increasing its gas emissions and create a two-tier system where the US sets its own targets while the rest of the world adheres to stricter Kyoto limits. Japan's business lobby expresses concern that further emission reduction policies will hurt their industrial competitiveness. The clash over how to address global warming while considering economic factors occurs at an awkward time in US-Japanese relations, with some analysts predicting a decrease in the importance of the relationship as Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes. The US decision on the Kyoto Protocol is one of several signals that Washington is becoming more unilateralist in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.
