Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's decision not to ratify it, which upsets Japan and other allies. It mentions the environmental consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat. The author emphasizes the moral responsibility of countries, especially the US, to address climate change. Japan feels proud and relevant because they helped shape the Kyoto Protocol, so the US's stance is a blow to their efforts.

There's a tension between the US and Japan, with the US being seen as unilateral. The Bush administration's alternative plan is criticized for allowing more emissions, which could lead to a two-tier system where some countries have stricter limits than others. Environmental groups are concerned this will weaken the Kyoto Protocol's effectiveness.

On the other hand, Japanese industry argues that further emission reductions could harm their competitiveness. The article highlights the conflict between economic interests and environmental responsibility.

I need to capture all these elements in a concise summary, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll focus on the US's decision upsetting Japan, the environmental stakes, the criticism of the US's unilateral approach, and the economic vs. environmental debate in Japan.

Let me structure this into a coherent summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key moral points.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral and political implications of the US's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which has caused frustration among its allies, particularly Japan. The Kyoto Protocol, shaped in part to address global warming, was a source of pride for Japan, as it demonstrated the country's role in international climate efforts. However, the US's refusal to ratify the protocol, coupled with its alternative plan, which critics argue allows continued emission increases, has sparked indignation. Environmental advocates fear this could lead to a two-tier system, weakening the protocol's effectiveness. While Japanese industry argues that further emission reductions could harm competitiveness, the broader moral framing highlights the US's unilateral approach and its impact on global cooperation in addressing climate change. END OF SUMMARY.
