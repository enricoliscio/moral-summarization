Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Kyoto Protocol and the US's stance, which is causing issues with Japan and other countries. The user wants the summary to include the morally framed words provided.

I should identify the key moral elements. The article mentions dire consequences like coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat, which are strong moral issues. The US's decision not to ratify Kyoto is a big point, and Japan is upset because they were proud of hosting the protocol. There's a clash between the US and Japan, especially in their economic and political relations.

I need to make sure to include words like "die," "shaping," "turn," "clash," "attacks," "pulling," "labeling," "consult," "reduce," "finding," "increase," "implemented," and "hurt." I'll structure the summary to highlight the US's unilateral decision, Japan's indignation, the potential two-tier system, and the impact on global efforts.

I'll start by stating the US's decision to not ratify Kyoto, then mention the moral consequences. Next, I'll talk about Japan's pride in the protocol and their reaction. Then, I'll include the clash in US-Japanese relations and the Bush administration's alternative plan, noting that environmentalists are concerned it won't reduce emissions enough. I'll also mention the possible withdrawal of smaller nations and the two-tier system. Finally, I'll touch on the business perspective in Japan, where they feel further reductions might hurt their competitiveness.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points and the moral framing words. Let me put it all together, making sure each sentence flows logically and includes the necessary terms.

SUMMARY: The US decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol has caused significant moral and political friction, particularly with Japan, which played a key role in shaping the accord. Climate experts warn of dire consequences like coral reefs dying, polar bears losing habitat, and birds migrating north, emphasizing the urgent need for global action. Japan, proud of its role in hosting the protocol, views the US stance as a betrayal, with environmental groups labeling it "inadmissible." The clash over global warming solutions coincides with strained US-Japanese relations, as Washington's unilateralist approach—pulling out of Kyoto and labeling nations like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as threats—has alienated allies. While the Bush administration offers an alternative plan to reduce pollutants, critics argue it allows US emissions to increase, potentially leading to a two-tier system where some nations opt out of Kyoto's stricter limits. Japanese industry, already implementing energy-saving measures, fears further reductions could hurt competitiveness. The US's "do-it-our-way" approach has sparked indignation globally, with many seeing it as a failure to consult and act responsibly on a global issue. END OF SUMMARY.
