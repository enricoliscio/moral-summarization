Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the US stance on the Kyoto Protocol and how it's affecting relations with Japan. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by talking about the potential consequences of global warming, like coral reefs dying, polar bears losing habitat, and birds migrating further north. It mentions the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 by 150 countries, as a significant step to address this issue. However, President George Bush's decision not to ratify the protocol is causing concern and irritation among US allies, especially Japan.

Japan is particularly upset because they were instrumental in shaping the Kyoto Protocol, and it was a source of national pride. They see the US's refusal as a major setback, especially since the US is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The article also touches on the broader context of US-Japanese relations, noting that Japan's economic influence in Asia is declining, which might affect the importance of their alliance with the US.

Additionally, the article mentions that the US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as less effective by environmental groups. They worry that this might lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest follow Kyoto's stricter limits. There's also a mention of Japanese industry being supportive of the alternative plan, as they've already made efforts to reduce emissions and don't want further policies that could harm their competitiveness.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the US's refusal to ratify Kyoto, Japan's reaction, the implications for global efforts, and the alternative plan proposed by the US. I'll also mention the concerns about a two-tier system and the differing views within Japan regarding the impact on industry.

Let me structure the summary to start with the US stance, then Japan's perspective, the potential consequences, and the alternative plan. I should keep it concise and ensure all key elements are covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the US's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which has caused concern and irritation among its allies, particularly Japan. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, aimed to address global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Japan, proud of its role in shaping the protocol, views the US's decision as a major setback, especially since the US is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The article highlights the potential consequences of global warming, such as coral reefs dying and polar bears losing habitat, and notes that the US's alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, is seen as less effective by environmental groups. They fear this could lead to a two-tier system where the US and a few others set their own targets, while the rest follow Kyoto's stricter limits. While some in Japan, particularly the industry, support the alternative plan, others worry it could harm Japan's industrial competitiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
