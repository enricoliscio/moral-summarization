SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office, defeating opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The election result has sparked a split in response from African nations and the West. While African nations, including South Africa, have accepted the result, Western countries, including the US and UK, have condemned the election as flawed and illegitimate. US President George Bush has stated that the US will not recognize Mugabe's government, and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has condemned Mugabe for waging a "systematic campaign of violence." The opposition in Zimbabwe is in disarray, with Tsvangirai ruling out open rebellion and calling for a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory. The government has taken measures to prevent a popular uprising, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks.

END OF SUMMARY.
