SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, but the election was marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe's victory has caused an ugly split in responses from black African nations and the West. While the West has criticized the election as flawed and rigged, with the US considering new sanctions, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional superpower South Africa, have found little to object to. The opposition MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud," and ruled out open rebellion despite people being "seething with anger." Domestic observers have sided with the MDC, denouncing the election as unfair and fraud-tainted. The government is taking no chances of a popular uprising, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. The last thing South Africa wants is to deal with thousands of refugees fleeing war and political turmoil. This election has highlighted tensions between the West and African nations, with the former prioritizing democratic principles and the latter focusing on regional stability.
END OF SUMMARY.
