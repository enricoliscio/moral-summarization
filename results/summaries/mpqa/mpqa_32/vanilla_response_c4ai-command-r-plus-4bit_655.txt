SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. Mugabe received 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast, despite widespread criticism and allegations of fraud. The election has caused a rift in responses from black African nations and the West. While the US, Britain, and Canada have criticized the election as flawed and rigged, Zimbabwe's neighbors and regional superpower South Africa have found little to object to, with South African observer head Sam Motsuenyane declaring the result legitimate. The Organization of African Unity also commended the electoral officers for their conduct during the elections. Mugabe's victory has sparked confusion and dismay within the MDC, with Tsvangirai ruling out open rebellion despite widespread anger among the people. The MDC is now seeking a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory, while the government has put the military on alert and set up police roadblocks to prevent any potential uprising.
