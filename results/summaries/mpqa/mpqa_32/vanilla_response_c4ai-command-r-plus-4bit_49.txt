SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence and manipulation of electoral laws. While the West, including US President George Bush and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, criticized the election as flawed and illegitimate, African nations and observers from the Organization of African Unity largely supported the result. The split in response has caused tension between the West and Africa. Mr. Mugabe's victory, with 56% of the 3.1 million votes, has been denounced by Mr. Tsvangirai and domestic observers as fraudulent and unfair. Despite the controversy, Zimbabwe's neighbours, including regional power South Africa, have largely accepted the result. The main concern for South Africa is regional stability, as Zimbabwe's economy has collapsed, causing high unemployment and food shortages. There are fears that the situation could lead to war and political turmoil, causing an influx of refugees into South Africa. Mr. Tsvangirai has ruled out open rebellion against Mr. Mugabe's government, but the MDC and other civic groups have called for peaceful protests against the election result. The Zimbabwean government has responded by putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks to prevent any uprising. The international community is now debating how to respond to Mr. Mugabe's controversial victory and the potential implications for the region. END OF SUMMARY.
