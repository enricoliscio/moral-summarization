SUMMARY:

Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's president, defeating Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The West, led by the US, has denounced the election as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's government. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some even calling the result "legitimate". Tsvangirai has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud" and has ruled out open rebellion, instead seeking a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory. The opposition is in disarray, with many supporters too scared to protest. The government has put the military on alert and set up police roadblocks to prevent a popular uprising. The election has highlighted the split between Africa and the West, with regional stability a key concern for South Africa.
