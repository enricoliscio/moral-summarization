SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe was declared the winner in Zimbabwe's election, but the victory was marred by allegations of rigging, violence, and intimidation. While Western nations such as the United States and Britain criticized the election and considered imposing sanctions, Zimbabwe's neighboring African countries, including regional power South Africa, found little fault with the process and recognized the result as legitimate. This has created an ugly split in the response from black African nations and the West. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, was left bewildered by the result and ruled out open rebellion, despite calls from some quarters for a general strike to protest the election outcome. The Zimbabwean government, however, was taking no chances and put the military on alert while setting up police roadblocks in major cities to prevent any potential uprising. The article highlights the challenges of ensuring free and fair elections in a country with a troubled political history, and the differing perspectives on what constitutes a legitimate democratic process.
