SUMMARY: 

Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader for 22 years, has won a fifth term in office, defeating his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. The win gives Mugabe a six-year term in office, but Tsvangirai calls the election "the biggest electoral fraud" he has ever witnessed. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as "flawed" and threatened sanctions, while African nations, including South Africa, have accepted the result as "legitimate". Tsvangirai's party is in disarray, with some members calling for protests, but others are too scared to act. The government has put the military on alert and set up police roadblocks to prevent a popular uprising. The economy has imploded, with unemployment near 60% and inflation running at 112% a year, leaving many people hungry. The split between the West and Africa over Mugabe's win has exposed the different values placed on democracy and regional stability.
