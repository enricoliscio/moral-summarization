SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The win gives Mugabe a six-year term, but has been denounced by Western nations, including the US and UK, who claim the election was flawed. African nations, including South Africa, have been more accepting of the result, with some calling it "legitimate" and "transparent". Tsvangirai has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud" and has ruled out open rebellion. The opposition is in disarray, with many supporters too scared to protest. The government has put the military on alert and set up police roadblocks to prevent a popular uprising. The election has highlighted the divide between Africa and the West, with regional stability a key concern for South Africa.
