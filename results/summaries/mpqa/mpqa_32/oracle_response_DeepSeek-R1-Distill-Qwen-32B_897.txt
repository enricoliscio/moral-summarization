Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Robert Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe, which is disputed. The key points are the rigged election, the split between African nations supporting Mugabe and Western criticism, Mugabe's tactics like violence and intimidation, and the economic crisis in Zimbabwe.

I need to include words like rigged, violence, intimidation, manipulation, fraud, robbery, flawed, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, showing Mugabe's unethical practices and the international response.

I'll mention Mugabe's 56% win, Tsvangirai's fraud claims, Western condemnation, and African support. I'll also touch on the economic situation and the impact on Zimbabweans.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe's re-election in Zimbabwe was widely condemned as rigged, with Morgan Tsvangirai accusing it of being the "biggest electoral fraud" and "daylight robbery." Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader since independence, secured 56% of the vote amid violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Western leaders, including George W. Bush, denounced the result as flawed, while African nations like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity declared the election transparent and legitimate. Tsvangirai's supporters faced threats and were prevented from campaigning, leading to widespread anger but no open rebellion. Zimbabwe's economy, plagued by imploded growth, 60% unemployment, and 112% inflation, further destabilized the region. The government took measures to suppress dissent, setting up roadblocks and chasing away protesters. Despite Mugabe's rural strongholds, urban areas like Harare saw low voter turnout, with many cast ballots marred by disorganization. The split between Western criticism and African support highlighted the global divide over Mugabe's rule, which has left Zimbabwe on the brink of turmoil. END OF SUMMARY.
