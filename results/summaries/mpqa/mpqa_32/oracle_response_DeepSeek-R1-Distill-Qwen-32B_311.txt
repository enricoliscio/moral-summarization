Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Mugabe's election win, preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary, up to 200 words, using as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify key points and the moral language used.

The article describes Mugabe's election victory, which is widely seen as rigged. The moral terms include rigged, violence, intimidation, manipulation, fraud, robbery, flawed, campaign, etc. I should make sure to include these words to maintain the author's framing.

First, Mugabe won the election with 56% of the votes, but it's marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation. The West, led by Bush, condemns it as flawed, while African nations like South Africa accept it. Tsvangirai accuses it as the biggest fraud, and there's widespread anger but no open rebellion.

I need to structure the summary to include these elements: the rigged election, Mugabe's win, Western criticism, African support, Tsvangirai's fraud claims, the economic turmoil, and the lack of open rebellion. I should also mention the military alert and the impact on Zimbabwe's economy.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won a contested election in Zimbabwe, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of rigging, violence, intimidation, and manipulation. Western leaders, including George W. Bush, condemned the result as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's victory, while African nations like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity declared the election legitimate. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, accused the election of being the biggest fraud he had ever seen, calling it "daylight robbery." Despite widespread anger, Tsvangirai ruled out open rebellion. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment, inflation, and hunger, raising concerns about regional stability. The government deployed military and police to prevent protests, as Mugabe's supporters celebrated their victory. The election was marred by disorganization, particularly in urban areas, where Tsvangirai's supporters were allegedly disenfranchised. The outcome deepened the divide between Western criticism and African acceptance of Mugabe's rule. END OF SUMMARY.
