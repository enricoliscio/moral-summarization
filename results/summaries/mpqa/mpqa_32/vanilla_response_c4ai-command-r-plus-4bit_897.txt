SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe received 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai, who called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed." While the West, including the US, UK, and Canada, criticized the election and considered imposing sanctions, Zimbabwe's neighbors and regional powers, such as South Africa, found little to object to in the election. Observers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) declared the elections "transparent, credible, free, and fair." The split in response from black African nations and the West highlighted the complex dynamics surrounding the election. Zimbabwe's security laws prohibited calling for a general strike, and the government took measures to prevent a popular uprising. Despite the MDC's claims of fraud and unfairness, there was no sign of revolution in the capital. The article also highlights the economic crisis in Zimbabwe, with high unemployment, inflation, and food shortages, and notes South Africa's concern for regional stability. END OF SUMMARY.
