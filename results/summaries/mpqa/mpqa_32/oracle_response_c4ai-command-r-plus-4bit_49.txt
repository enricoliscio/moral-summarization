SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, but the election was marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe's victory has caused an ugly split in the response from black African nations and the West. While the West has criticized the election as flawed and rigged, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional superpower South Africa, have found little to object to. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed," and the MDC has admitted that they were not prepared for this outcome. The MDC and domestic observers have denounced the election as unfair and fraud-tainted, and there are fears of a popular uprising. However, on the streets of the capital, there is no sign of revolution, and the people seem scared and despondent. South Africa's main concern is regional stability, as Zimbabwe's economy has imploded, with high unemployment, inflation, and hunger. The international community is now left to decide how to deal with this flawed election and the potential consequences for the region. END OF SUMMARY.
