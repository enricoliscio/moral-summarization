SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election denounced by most observers as rigged. The election was marred by intimidation, violence, and the manipulation of electoral laws. Despite the fraudulent nature of the election, there is an ugly split in the response from black African nations and the West. While the West, led by US President George Bush, has criticized the election as flawed and condemned Mugabe for his systematic campaign of violence, African nations such as South Africa have found little to object to in the election, with observers from the Organization of African Unity declaring the elections transparent, credible, free, and fair. This has led to confusion and despondency among the opposition, with their leader Morgan Tsvangirai ruling out rebellion and calling for a non-confrontational approach to counter Mugabe's victory. Domestic observers, however, have sided with the opposition, denouncing the election as unfair and fraudulent. The moral dilemma is heightened by the potential for a popular uprising, with the government putting the military on alert and setting up roadblocks to prevent protests. The economic crisis in Zimbabwe, with high unemployment, inflation, and food shortages, adds to the concern for regional stability, especially for South Africa, which is already dealing with an influx of economic migrants. The split in international responses highlights the challenge of balancing respect for participatory democracy with the need to maintain regional stability and prevent further turmoil.
