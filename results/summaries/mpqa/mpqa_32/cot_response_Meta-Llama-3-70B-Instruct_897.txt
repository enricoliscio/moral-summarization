SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader, has won a fifth term in office, defeating Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as "flawed" and "fraud-tainted," refusing to recognize Mugabe's government. In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some even calling it "legitimate" and "credible." The opposition, led by Tsvangirai, has denounced the election as a "daylight robbery" and vowed to find a way to counter Mugabe's victory. Meanwhile, the people of Zimbabwe are "seething with anger" but are too scared to take to the streets. END OF SUMMARY.
