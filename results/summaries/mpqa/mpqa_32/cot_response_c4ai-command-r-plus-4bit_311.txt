SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by moral issues. The election was denounced as rigged by most observers, with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai describing it as "the biggest electoral robbery I have ever witnessed in my life." The result has caused an ugly split in the response from black African nations and the West. While the West has criticized the election as flawed and systematically violent, Zimbabwe's neighbors and regional superpower South Africa have found little to object to. This discrepancy in reactions has revealed a divide between the priorities of the West and African nations. 

Domestic observers, along with the MDC, have sided with Tsvangirai, denouncing the election as fraud-tainted and unfair. The moral dilemma has left the MDC leadership confused about their next steps, with no plans for open rebellion against Mugabe's victory. Meanwhile, the government has taken precautions to prevent any popular uprising, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. 

The election has also highlighted the issue of regional stability, with South Africa concerned about the influx of economic migrants and the potential for thousands of refugees fleeing political turmoil. This complex situation demonstrates the ethical complexities of international relations and the challenges of ensuring free and fair elections in a global context. 

END OF SUMMARY.
