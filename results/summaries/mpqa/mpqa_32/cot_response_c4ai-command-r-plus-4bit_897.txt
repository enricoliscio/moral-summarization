SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, despite widespread condemnation of the election as rigged and marred by violence and intimidation. The election has caused an ugly split in responses, with black African nations largely accepting the result as legitimate while Western countries have criticized it as flawed and condemned Mugabe for his systematic campaign of violence. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed," and ruled out confrontation with the state, despite his despondent attitude. Domestic observers have sided with the opposition, denouncing the election as unfair and fraud-tainted. While there have been calls for protests, there is no sign of revolution brewing, and the government has taken steps to prevent a popular uprising. The situation in Zimbabwe is particularly concerning for neighboring South Africa, which is already dealing with economic migrants and does not want to add thousands of refugees fleeing war and political turmoil to the mix. This complex issue highlights the tensions between regional stability and the desire for participatory democracy.
