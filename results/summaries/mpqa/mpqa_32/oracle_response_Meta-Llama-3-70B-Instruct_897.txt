SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader for 22 years, has won a fifth term in office in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. The win was hailed by Mugabe's supporters, but denounced by the opposition and Western nations as a "runaway victory" and "daylight robbery". The election was characterized by fraud, with Mugabe's opponent Morgan Tsvangirai calling it "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed". The West, led by the US, has refused to recognize the election result, with President George Bush saying it was "flawed". In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some even calling it "legitimate". The opposition is now left to regroup and come up with a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory, with some calling for protests and others ruling out open rebellion. The country remains on edge, with the military on alert and police roadblocks set up around major cities. END OF SUMMARY.
