SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The win gives Mugabe a six-year term, but has been denounced by Western nations, including the US, UK, and Canada, who claim the election was rigged. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, have accepted the result, citing "administrative oversight" for any irregularities. Tsvangirai has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud" and vowed to find a way to counter Mugabe's victory, but has ruled out open rebellion. The government has put the military on alert and set up police roadblocks to prevent protests. The election has highlighted a split between Africa and the West, with regional stability a key concern for South Africa.
