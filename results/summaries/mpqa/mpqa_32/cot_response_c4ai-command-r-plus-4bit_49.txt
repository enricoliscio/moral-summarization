SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and allegations of rigging. The election has caused a rift between black African nations and the West, with the West denouncing the election as rigged and flawed while African observers, including regional superpower South Africa, deemed it transparent, credible, free, and fair. Mugabe's victory, with 56% of the 3.1 million votes, has been hailed by Zimbabwe's Justice Minister as a "runaway victory." However, his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud," alleging treason and intimidation tactics by Mugabe's regime. The US and UK have led the criticism from the West, with President Bush refusing to recognize Mugabe's government and Secretary of State Powell implying possible sanctions. In contrast, South Africa's main concern is regional stability, given the imploded economy and high unemployment in Zimbabwe. The article highlights the contrasting reactions to the election, with the MDC and domestic observers denouncing the result as fraudulent and unfair while Mugabe's regime consolidates power despite the allegations of treason and turmoil.
