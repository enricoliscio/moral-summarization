SUMMARY:

The re-election of Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president has sparked a divide between African nations and Western countries. Mugabe's victory, marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation, was hailed by African nations, including South Africa, as legitimate. In contrast, Western leaders, such as US President George Bush, condemned the election as flawed and threatened to impose sanctions. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, called the election "daylight robbery" and claimed it did not reflect the true will of the Zimbabwean people. Despite widespread discontent, Tsvangirai ruled out open rebellion, fearing confrontation with the state. The Zimbabwean government has taken measures to prevent protests, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. The election has exposed the moral hypocrisy of African nations, prioritizing regional stability over democratic values, and the West's selective outrage over electoral fraud.
