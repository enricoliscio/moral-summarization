SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The win gives Mugabe a six-year term, but Tsvangirai and many observers have denounced the election as fraudulent. The West, led by the US, has refused to recognize the election outcome, with President George Bush calling it "flawed." In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some calling the result "legitimate" and "credible." The opposition is split on how to respond, with some calling for protests and others advocating for a more cautious approach. The government has taken steps to prevent unrest, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. The election outcome has sparked a divide between the West and Africa, with implications for regional stability and democracy.
