SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won Zimbabwe's presidential election, securing a fifth term in office with 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast. The election was marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws, with the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, denouncing it as "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed." The election has highlighted a divide between black African nations and the West, with Western leaders such as US President George Bush and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw criticizing the election as flawed and illegitimate. In contrast, regional powers such as South Africa and the Organization of African Unity have recognized the election as legitimate and transparent. The moral dilemma lies in the conflicting interests and values at play: the West prioritizing democratic principles and the rule of law, while African nations prioritize regional stability and respect for sovereignty. The situation is further complicated by the potential for a popular uprising against Mugabe's victory, which the government is attempting to suppress through military force and police roadblocks. The MDC, Tsvangirai's party, has called for peaceful protests, but the country's security laws make it illegal to call for a general strike. The future of Zimbabwe hangs in the balance as the international community grapples with how to respond to this moral and political conundrum. END OF SUMMARY.
