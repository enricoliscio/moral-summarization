SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe's victory has caused a rift in responses from black African nations and the West, with the West criticizing the election as flawed and undemocratic while Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional superpower South Africa, found little to object to. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed," and Western leaders, such as US President George Bush and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, condemned the election and considered imposing sanctions. In contrast, observer teams from South Africa and the Organization of African Unity declared the elections legitimate, transparent, credible, free, and fair. The disparity in responses highlights a moral dilemma between upholding democratic ideals and maintaining regional stability, with the potential for devastating consequences for the people of Zimbabwe if the situation escalates. The MDC and domestic observers denounced the election as fraudulent and unfair, and the people of Zimbabwe, though angry, are too scared to protest due to the presence of the military and police. The future of Zimbabwe hangs in the balance as Mugabe consolidates his power and the international community debates how to respond. END OF SUMMARY.
