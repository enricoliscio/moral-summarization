SUMMARY:

Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's president, but the election has been widely denounced as rigged. The West, including the US and UK, has condemned the election, with US President George Bush saying Washington would not recognize Mugabe's government. In contrast, many African nations, including South Africa, have accepted the result, with some even calling it "legitimate" and "credible". The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has cried foul, saying the election was marred by violence, intimidation, and fraud. Tsvangirai has ruled out open rebellion, but has called for protests against the election. The government has responded by putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. The election has highlighted a split between the West and Africa, with the former prioritizing democracy and the latter prioritizing regional stability. The outcome has left many Zimbabweans feeling despondent and scared, with some fearing for their safety.

END OF SUMMARY.
