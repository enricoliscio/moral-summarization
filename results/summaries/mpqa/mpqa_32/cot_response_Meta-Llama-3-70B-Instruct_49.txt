SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader, has won a fifth term in office in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as "flawed" and "rigged," while African nations, including South Africa, have accepted the result as "legitimate" and "credible." Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has denounced the election as "the biggest electoral fraud" and "daylight robbery." The election has exposed an "ugly split" between Africa and the West, with the US threatening to impose new sanctions. The people of Zimbabwe are "seething with anger" but are too "scared" to take to the streets. The country's economy is in shambles, with unemployment near 60% and inflation at 112%. END OF SUMMARY.
