SUMMARY:

Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office in Zimbabwe's election, which has been denounced by many as rigged and marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation. Mugabe's victory has been hailed by his supporters, but his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud" he has ever witnessed. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as flawed and is considering imposing new sanctions. In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some even calling the result "legitimate".

The election has been marked by fraud, violence, and intimidation, with Tsvangirai's supporters being threatened and prevented from campaigning. The opposition is now left to ponder its next move, with many expressing anger and frustration at the outcome. The government, meanwhile, is taking no chances, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks to prevent any potential uprising.
