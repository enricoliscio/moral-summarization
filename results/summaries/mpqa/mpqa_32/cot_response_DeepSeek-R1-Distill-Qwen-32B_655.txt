Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Mugabe's election win and the reactions from different countries. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "rigged," "fraud," "intimidation," "manipulation," "despondent," "flawed," "condemned," "violence," "shady tactics," "daylight robbery," "flawed," "fraud-tainted," "unfair," "illegal," "scared," "oppression," "refugees," "crisis," "desperation," "corruption," "injustices," and "oppression." These words highlight the moral issues involved.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Mugabe's rigged election and the split between African nations and the West. I'll include the fraud, intimidation, and manipulation. Then, I'll note the reactions from Mugabe's supporters and his opponents, including Tsvangirai's strong condemnation. 

I'll also mention the Western criticism, Bush's refusal to recognize the result, and the possibility of sanctions. On the other hand, African countries like South Africa and the OAU supported the election as legitimate, despite the fraud. The MDC's confusion and the government's measures to prevent protests should be included. Finally, I'll touch on Zimbabwe's economic crisis and the regional concerns about refugees.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral framing. I'll structure it to show the divide between the West and Africa, the fraud in the election, the reactions from different groups, and the ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe.

**SUMMARY:**  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of rigging, fraud, intimidation, and manipulation. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, accused the election of being the "biggest electoral fraud" and "daylight robbery," claiming it did not reflect the people's will. Western leaders, including George W. Bush, condemned the result as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's government, while some African nations, like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), supported the election as legitimate. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was left confused, as they had expected to win. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raising fears of regional instability and refugees fleeing the country. END OF SUMMARY.
