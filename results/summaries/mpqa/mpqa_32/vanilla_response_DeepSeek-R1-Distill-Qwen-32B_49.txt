Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Robert Mugabe winning the Zimbabwean elections, but there's a lot of controversy around it. 

Mugabe got 56% of the votes, and Tsvangirai got 41%. But Tsvangirai is calling it a fraud. The West, especially the US and UK, are criticizing the election as rigged, while African countries like South Africa are supporting the result. 

I should mention the split between African nations and Western countries. Also, the election was marred by violence and intimidation. Mugabe's victory is a fifth term, and he's been in power for 22 years. 

The West is not recognizing the result, and the US might impose more sanctions. Meanwhile, African observers say the elections were transparent and fair. 

Tsvangirai is dejected and says the result doesn't reflect the people's will. There's confusion in his party, and they're planning a strategy. Zimbabwe's economy is bad, with high unemployment and inflation, which is a concern for neighboring South Africa. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Mugabe's win, the split between African and Western responses, the election issues, and the economic context. 

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's win and the split, then the election issues, reactions from West and Africa, Tsvangirai's response, and the economic situation. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed.
