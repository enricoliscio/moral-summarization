Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Mugabe's election in Zimbabwe. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Mugabe winning the election, which was criticized as rigged. The West, led by the US and UK, is denouncing the election, while African countries like South Africa support it. Mugabe's victory is seen as illegitimate by the opposition and international observers, with issues like violence, intimidation, and electoral fraud highlighted.

I should focus on the moral aspects: the West's criticism of electoral fraud and human rights concerns, versus African support for sovereignty and stability. The economic crisis in Zimbabwe is also a point, as it affects neighboring countries like South Africa.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll highlight the main issues: Mugabe's win, the split between West and Africa, the flawed election process, and the regional implications. I'll make sure to mention the consequences like sanctions and the impact on Zimbabwe's economy.

Putting it all together, the summary should reflect the moral divide and the broader implications for the region.

SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. Western leaders, including George W. Bush and Jack Straw, condemned the election as flawed and refused to recognize the results, while African nations, such as South Africa, supported Mugabe's victory. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the election of being "daylight robbery" and rejected the outcome. The West threatened sanctions, while African observers declared the elections "free and fair." Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raising concerns about regional stability as South Africa faces an influx of migrants. The split between Western criticism of democratic violations and African support for Mugabe's sovereignty highlights a moral and political divide. END OF SUMMARY.
