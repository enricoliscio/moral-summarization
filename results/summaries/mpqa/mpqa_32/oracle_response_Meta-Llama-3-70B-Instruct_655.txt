SUMMARY: 

Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader, has won a fifth term in office amidst allegations of a rigged election, marked by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as flawed, with Bush stating that Washington would not recognize Mugabe's government. In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to in the election, with some even calling the result legitimate. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, has denounced the election as "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed in my life," and has ruled out open rebellion. The people of Zimbabwe are "seething with anger" but are too scared to protest, fearing a crackdown by the government. The country's economy has imploded, with unemployment near 60% and inflation running at 112% a year, leaving many people hungry and desperate.
