SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe received 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast, defeating opponent Morgan Tsvangirai, who called the election "the biggest electoral fraud." The election results were denounced by Western leaders, with US President George Bush refusing to recognize Mugabe's government and considering new sanctions. However, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional power South Africa, found little to object to in the election. Observers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) declared the elections transparent, credible, free, and fair. The MDC, Tsvangirai's party, denounced the election as fraudulent and unfair, but ruled out open rebellion. There was no sign of revolution in the capital, and the government took steps to prevent a popular uprising. South Africa's main concern was regional stability rather than democratic participation, as Zimbabwe's economic collapse has already caused an influx of migrants. The article highlights the differing perspectives on the election between Western nations and African countries, with the West criticizing the election while Africa largely accepts Mugabe's victory.
