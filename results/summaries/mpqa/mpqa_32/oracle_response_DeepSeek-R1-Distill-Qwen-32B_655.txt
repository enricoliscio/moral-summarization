Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe, the reactions from different countries, and the internal situation in Zimbabwe. The article highlights the rigged election, violence, intimidation, and fraud involved. 

I should identify the key events: Mugabe's win, the West's criticism, African support, the internal conflict in Zimbabwe, and the economic issues. I need to use the specified moral terms like rigged, violence, fraud, etc., to frame the summary accurately.

I'll start by stating Mugabe's rigged victory and the election issues. Then, mention the split between African nations supporting him and the West denouncing it. Include Tsvangirai's fraud claims and the harsh criticism from Western leaders. Also, note the African support and Mugabe's consolidation of power. 

Next, I'll address the internal situation: the MDC's confusion, threats, and the government's control measures. Highlight the economic crisis and South Africa's concerns. Finally, wrap it up by showing the regional divide and Mugabe's continued control despite opposition.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the moral terms are included where appropriate. I'll structure it to flow logically from Mugabe's win to the reactions, internal issues, and regional implications.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won a controversial election in Zimbabwe, with most observers denouncing it as rigged, marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation. Mugabe secured 56% of the vote, while his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the result of being the "biggest electoral fraud" he had ever witnessed. The West, led by U.S. President George Bush, criticized the election as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's victory, with Colin Powell hinting at new sanctions. Meanwhile, African nations, including South Africa, largely supported the outcome, calling it legitimate despite widespread fraud-tainted claims. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) expressed confusion and anger, with members admitting they were unprepared for Mugabe's victory. Zimbabwe's economy remains in disarray, with high unemployment and inflation, raising fears of regional instability as South Africa seeks to stem migration and political turmoil. Mugabe's re-election deepened the divide between African and Western responses, with the latter calling for action to address the flawed election and its consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
