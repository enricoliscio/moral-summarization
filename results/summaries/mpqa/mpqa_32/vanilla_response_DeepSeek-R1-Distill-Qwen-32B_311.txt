Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Mugabe's election in Zimbabwe. Let me read through the article first. It's about the split between African nations and the West regarding Mugabe's victory. The article mentions that Mugabe won with 56% of the votes, but there were allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. The West, led by the US and UK, criticized the election, while African countries like South Africa and the OAU supported it. There's also internal conflict in Zimbabwe, with the opposition MDC not knowing what to do next. The economic situation is bad, with high unemployment and inflation. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mugabe's win and the divided reactions. Then mention the election issues like fraud and violence. Highlight the West's criticism and African support. Include Mugabe's response and Tsvangirai's reaction. Also, note the economic problems and regional concerns. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail. 

Wait, I should also include the part about the split between African nations and the West, and maybe the internal confusion in the MDC. Oh, and the economic impact on South Africa. Let me structure this step by step to ensure all main points are covered within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's disputed elections, securing a fifth term with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. Western leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush, condemned the election as flawed and refused to recognize the results, while African nations like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) supported the outcome as legitimate. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the election of being a "daylight robbery" and denied the results reflected Zimbabwe's true will. The West threatened sanctions, while African countries focused on regional stability. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raising concerns about regional instability and migration. END OF SUMMARY.
