SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term in office in Zimbabwe's elections, but the victory has been denounced by many as "rigged" and "fraud-tainted." The election was marred by "violence," "intimidation," and "manipulation" of electoral laws. The West, led by US President George Bush, has refused to recognize the outcome, calling it "flawed." In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to, with one observer team calling the result "legitimate." The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has cried "daylight robbery" and vowed to contest the result. The election has been widely criticized as "unfair" and "unacceptable," with many Zimbabweans "seething with anger." END OF SUMMARY.
