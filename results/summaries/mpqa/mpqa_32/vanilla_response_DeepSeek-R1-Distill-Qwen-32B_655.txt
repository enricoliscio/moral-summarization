Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Mugabe won the election, but there's a lot of criticism, especially from the West. They think the election was rigged. Mugabe got 56% of the votes, and his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, got 41%. Tsvangirai accused the election of being a fraud. The West, led by the US and UK, is not recognizing the results and is considering sanctions. However, African countries, especially Zimbabwe's neighbors like South Africa, are more accepting of the results, calling the election transparent and fair.

The article also mentions the economic situation in Zimbabwe, with high unemployment and inflation, and how South Africa is concerned about regional stability and potential refugees.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Mugabe's win, the criticism from the West, support from African nations, Tsvangirai's accusations, and the economic context.

I should structure the summary to first mention Mugabe's victory and the split between African and Western responses. Then, highlight the accusations of fraud and the Western reactions, followed by the African support. Finally, touch on the economic issues and South Africa's concerns.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me make sure I include all the important elements without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election, securing a fifth term with 56% of the vote against Morgan Tsvangirai's 41%. Western nations, including the U.S. and U.K., criticized the election as fraudulent and rigged, with the U.S. refusing to recognize the results and considering sanctions. In contrast, African nations, particularly Zimbabwe's neighbors like South Africa, deemed the election legitimate. Tsvangirai accused the election of being a fraud and "daylight robbery," while Mugabe's supporters praised it as a "runaway victory." The election was marred by violence, intimidation, and irregularities, especially in urban areas where Tsvangirai's supporters faced disenfranchisement. Zimbabwe's economic crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, adds to regional concerns, particularly for South Africa, which fears an influx of refugees. END OF SUMMARY.
