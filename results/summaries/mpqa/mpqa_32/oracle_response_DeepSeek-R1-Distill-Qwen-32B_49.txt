Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Robert Mugabe winning the Zimbabwean election, which is widely seen as rigged. The West is criticizing it, while African nations like South Africa are more accepting.

I should focus on the morally charged words the author used. Words like "rigged," "violence," "fraud," "flawed," etc., are important. I need to include these to maintain the moral tone.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mugabe's win and the reactions. Then, mention the West's criticism versus African support. Include Mugabe's supporters and Tsvangirai's fraud claims. Also, touch on the economic issues and regional concerns.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the split between Western and African responses, the election irregularities, and the consequences for Zimbabwe. I'll make sure to use the key moral terms to convey the author's framing effectively.

Alright, putting it all together, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring all the moral elements are included.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's disputed election, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of rigging, violence, intimidation, and manipulation. Western leaders, including George W. Bush, denounced the result as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's victory, while African nations like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity declared the election legitimate. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the election of being "the biggest electoral fraud" and "daylight robbery," claiming it did not reflect the people's will. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment, inflation, and food shortages, raising fears of regional instability and refugee flows. Tsvangirai ruled out open rebellion but called for peaceful protests, while Mugabe's supporters celebrated his victory. The election was marred by disorganization, particularly in urban areas, where many voters were chased away or prevented from casting ballots. Mugabe's rural strongholds saw higher turnout, while the MDC and observers struggled to monitor remote polling stations. The split between Western criticism and African support highlights the tension over democracy and regional stability.  
END OF SUMMARY.
