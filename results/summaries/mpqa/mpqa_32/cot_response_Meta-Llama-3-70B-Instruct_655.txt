SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election widely denounced as rigged, marked by violence, intimidation, and manipulation. The West, led by US President George Bush, has condemned the election as flawed and refused to recognize Mugabe's government. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, have found little to object to, with some even calling the result legitimate. The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has cried foul, calling the election a "daylight robbery" and vowing to find a way to counter Mugabe's victory. The country remains in a state of confusion and fear, with many Zimbabweans seething with anger but too scared to take to the streets. END OF SUMMARY.
