SUMMARY:
Robert Mugabe has been re-elected for a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, despite widespread condemnation from Western nations and domestic observers who denounced the election as rigged, marred by violence, and intimidating. Mugabe's victory has created an ugly split in responses from black African nations and the West. While the West has criticized the election as fraudulent and unfair, with the US implying sanctions and travel bans, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional superpower South Africa, have found little to object to. Domestic observers and the opposition MDC party have sided with the Western view, denouncing the election as fraud-tainted and unfair. The MDC has also accused Mugabe of planning the disorganization in Harare to disenfranchise their supporters and create chaos. South Africa, meanwhile, is concerned about regional stability rather than the transparency and credibility of the election. They are already dealing with the flow of economic migrants and do not want to add thousands of refugees fleeing turmoil. The article concludes by highlighting the fear of popular uprising and the absence of any signs of revolution in the capital, despite the anger and disappointment felt by many Zimbabweans.
