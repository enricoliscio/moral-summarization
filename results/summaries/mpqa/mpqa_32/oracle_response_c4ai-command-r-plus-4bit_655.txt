SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, but the election was marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe's victory has caused an ugly split in the response from black African nations and the West. While Western leaders such as George Bush and Colin Powell have criticized the election as flawed and rigged, and have implied the possibility of new sanctions, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including regional superpower South Africa, have found little to object to. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed," and domestic observers have sided with him, denouncing the election as unfair and fraud-tainted. However, the military has been put on alert, and police roadblocks have been set up to prevent any popular uprising or open rebellion. The MDC claims that the disorganization in Harare, where many voters were chased away from polling stations, was planned by Mugabe to disenfranchise Tsvangirai's supporters. With Zimbabwe's economy in a dire state, and unemployment and inflation at alarming levels, the last thing South Africa wants is to deal with an influx of refugees fleeing war and political turmoil.
END OF SUMMARY.
