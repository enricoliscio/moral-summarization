SUMMARY:

Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader in an election marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation. The win has been denounced by many as a "runaway victory" achieved through "daylight robbery" and "electoral fraud." The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed in my life," and Western nations, including the US and UK, have refused to recognize the result, citing a "flawed" election. In contrast, African nations, such as South Africa, have found little to object to, with some observers calling the election "transparent, credible, free and fair." The opposition is now left to regroup and decide on a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory, with many Zimbabweans "seething with anger" but too scared to take to the streets. The government, meanwhile, is taking no chances, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks to prevent a popular uprising.
