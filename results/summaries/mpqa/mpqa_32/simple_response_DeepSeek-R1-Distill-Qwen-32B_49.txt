Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Mugabe's election in Zimbabwe. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the key points and the opposing viewpoints.

First, Mugabe won the election with 56%, but there were reports of fraud, violence, and intimidation. The West, led by the US and UK, is criticizing the election as flawed and considering sanctions. On the other hand, African countries like South Africa and the OAU are supporting the results as legitimate.

I should highlight the split between African nations and the West, Mugabe's consolidation of power, and the internal confusion in the opposition. Also, mention the economic issues in Zimbabwe and South Africa's concerns about stability.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. Make sure to include the main actors: Mugabe, Tsvangirai, Bush, Straw, Chretien, and the OAU. Also, note the different reactions and the implications for Zimbabwe's future.

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's win and the accusations of fraud. Then move to the international reactions, split between West and Africa. Mention Tsvangirai's response and the internal confusion. End with the economic context and regional concerns.

I should avoid any personal opinions, just present the facts as per the article, maintaining the moral stance presented, which is critical of Mugabe's tactics and the West's skepticism versus African support.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's disputed election, securing a fifth term with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. Western leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush, criticized the election as flawed and refused to recognize the results, threatening sanctions. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), largely accepted the outcome as legitimate, despite concerns about irregularities. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, called the election a "daylight robbery" and accused the government of disenfranchising his supporters. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raising fears of regional instability as South Africa seeks to stem migration. The split between Western condemnation and African support highlights the ongoing debate over democracy and regional stability in Zimbabwe.  
END OF SUMMARY.
