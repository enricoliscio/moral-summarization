Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Mugabe's election in Zimbabwe. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Mugabe won the election with 56% of the vote, but there were a lot of issues like violence, intimidation, and electoral law manipulation. The West, led by the US and UK, is criticizing the election as rigged and not recognizing the results. They're talking about imposing sanctions. Canada is more cautious, waiting for a Commonwealth report before deciding.

On the other hand, African nations like South Africa and the OAU are supporting the election as legitimate. There's a clear split between the West and African countries. Mugabe's supporters are celebrating, while the opposition, MDC, is frustrated and considering their next steps without openly rebelling.

Domestically, there's fear among the people, and the government is taking measures to prevent protests. The economic situation is dire, with high unemployment and inflation, which is a concern for neighboring South Africa.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral issues like fraud, violence, and the international divide. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original's tone and key points.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe won a contested election, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of fraud, violence, and intimidation. Western nations, including the U.S. and U.K., criticized the election as rigged and refused to recognize the results, threatening sanctions. Canada and other countries awaited a Commonwealth report before taking action. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), declared the election legitimate. Mugabe's victory sparked frustration among his opponents, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, who accused the election of being a "daylight robbery." Despite widespread anger, Tsvangirai ruled out open rebellion. Zimbabwe's economic crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, compounded regional concerns, particularly for South Africa, which fears an influx of refugees. END OF SUMMARY.
