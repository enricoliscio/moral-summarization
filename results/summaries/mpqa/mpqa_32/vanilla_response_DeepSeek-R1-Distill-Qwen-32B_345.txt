Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe. The user has provided a detailed article, so I'll start by reading through it to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Mugabe won the election with 56% of the votes, but there's a lot of criticism about the election being rigged. Observers from the West and some African countries are split in their responses. The West, including the US and UK, is denouncing the election as flawed, while African nations like South Africa are more accepting.

I should note the main points: Mugabe's victory, the accusations of fraud, the split between African and Western reactions, Mugabe's consolidation of power, and the implications for Zimbabwe's stability and economy.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key players, the election results, the criticism from the West, support from African countries, Mugabe's rural support, and the economic issues affecting Zimbabwe.

I should also mention the impact on Zimbabwe's economy and the potential for migration to South Africa. The user wants the summary after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I need to make sure it's clear and covers all critical aspects without getting too detailed.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include Mugabe's win, the fraud allegations, the split in international reactions, the economic situation, and the regional concerns. I'll ensure it's within the word limit and flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested elections with 56% of the vote, sparking a split between African nations and Western countries over the legitimacy of the results. Mugabe's victory, marred by violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities, was condemned by Western leaders, including U.S. President George Bush, who refused to recognize the outcome. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, accused the election of being the "biggest fraud" he had witnessed. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, largely accepted the results, with some observers calling the elections "transparent" and "credible." Mugabe's rural support and disorganization in urban areas, particularly Harare, contributed to his win. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's economic crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raises concerns about regional stability and potential migration to South Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
