SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe has won a fifth term as Zimbabwe's leader, but the election was marred by violence, intimidation, and manipulation of electoral laws. Mugabe's victory, with 56% of the 3.1 million votes, has been denounced as rigged by observers and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who called it "daylight robbery." The Western response has been critical, with US President George Bush refusing to recognize the outcome and considering new sanctions. In contrast, regional powers like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity have deemed the election legitimate, despite reports of fraud and unfair tactics. The MDC is now brainstorming strategies to counter Mugabe's win, but Tsvangirai has ruled out open rebellion due to security concerns and the potential for a popular uprising. Zimbabwe's economy is in a dire state, with high unemployment, inflation, and food shortages, adding to the complexity of the situation.

END OF SUMMARY.
