Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the moral terms used.

The article talks about Mugabe's election win, which was criticized as rigged. There's violence, intimidation, and manipulation involved. The West, led by the US and UK, is denouncing the election, while African nations like South Africa support it. Mugabe's supporters and opponents have conflicting views, with Tsvangirai calling it fraud. There's also economic turmoil in Zimbabwe, with high unemployment and inflation.

I should structure the summary to highlight the split between Africa and the West, the rigged election, Mugabe's tactics, the reactions from both sides, and the economic issues. I'll make sure to use words like rigged, violence, fraud, flawed, etc., to maintain the moral tone.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll start with Mugabe's win, mention the rigged election, then the split between African and Western responses. Include Tsvangirai's fraud claim and Mugabe's supporters' stance. Then touch on the economic problems and the regional impact. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election, with 56% of the vote, amid allegations of rigging, violence, intimidation, and manipulation. Western leaders, including George W. Bush and Jack Straw, denounced the election as flawed, while African nations like South Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) deemed it legitimate. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, accused the election of being "the biggest electoral fraud" and "daylight robbery," while Mugabe's supporters hailed it as a "runaway victory." The West threatened sanctions, while Zimbabwe's neighbors focused on regional stability amid economic collapse, 60% unemployment, and 112% inflation. Tsvangirai ruled out rebellion, but domestic observers and opposition groups criticized the election as fraud-tainted and unfair. Zimbabwe's security forces were on alert to prevent protests, as the country faced growing instability and potential refugee flows to South Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
