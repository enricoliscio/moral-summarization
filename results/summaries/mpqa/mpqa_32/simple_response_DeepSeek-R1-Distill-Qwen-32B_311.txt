Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the key points that highlight the moral issues, like the election being rigged, the split between African nations and the West, and the consequences for Zimbabwe.

First, I'll identify the main events: Mugabe's victory, the accusations of fraud, the reactions from different countries, and the internal situation in Zimbabwe. The article mentions that the West criticized the election as fraudulent, while African nations, especially South Africa, accepted the results. Mugabe's tactics included violence and manipulation, which are important moral points.

I should also note the economic and social impacts, like the high unemployment and inflation, as these add to the moral critique of Mugabe's leadership. The split between African support and Western condemnation is a central moral issue here, showing differing international priorities.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mugabe's win and the fraud accusations, then move to the split between African and Western responses. Mention the economic struggles and the regional implications, especially for South Africa. Finally, conclude with the moral conflict between stability and democracy.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral aspects without getting bogged down in too many details. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear and direct, making sure the key moral points are emphasized.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election, with 56% of the vote, amid accusations of fraud, violence, and manipulation. Western leaders, including George W. Bush and Jack Straw, condemned the election as flawed and refused to recognize the results, threatening sanctions. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, accepted the outcome as legitimate, prioritizing regional stability over democratic principles. Mugabe's opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, called the election a "daylight robbery" and rejected the results, though he ruled out open rebellion. Zimbabwe's economy is in crisis, with high unemployment and inflation, raising concerns about regional instability as South Africa seeks to stem migration. The split between African support and Western criticism highlights a moral conflict over democracy and stability.  
END OF SUMMARY.
