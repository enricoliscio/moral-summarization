SUMMARY:
The election in Zimbabwe has been denounced by many as "rigged" and "fraud-tainted", with reports of "violence", "intimidation", and "manipulation" of electoral laws. Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader, won a fifth term in office, but his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai called the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed in my life". The West, led by US President George Bush, has refused to recognize the outcome, calling it "flawed". In contrast, Zimbabwe's neighbors, including South Africa, have found little to object to, with one observer team calling the result "legitimate". The opposition is "seething with anger" but has ruled out open rebellion. The government has taken steps to prevent protests, putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks. The election has highlighted the country's deepening crisis, with an economy in shambles and widespread poverty. END OF SUMMARY.
