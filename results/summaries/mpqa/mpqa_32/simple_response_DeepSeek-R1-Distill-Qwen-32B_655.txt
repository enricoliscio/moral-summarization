Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's election win in Zimbabwe, focusing on the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about how Mugabe won the election with 56% of the vote, but there were a lot of issues like violence, intimidation, and manipulation. The West, led by the US and UK, criticized the election as rigged, while African nations like South Africa and the OAU supported it as fair.

I should highlight the moral issues here. The West is against Mugabe because of the election irregularities and human rights concerns. African countries are more supportive, maybe because of regional stability or not wanting external interference.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: Mugabe's win, the West's criticism, African support, the impact on Zimbabwe's stability, and the economic situation.

Let me structure it: Start with Mugabe's win and the split between West and Africa. Mention the election issues, Western criticism, African support, Mugabe's response, Tsvangirai's reaction, and the regional implications.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure it's clear and captures the moral perspectives from both sides.

SUMMARY:  
Robert Mugabe won Zimbabwe's contested election with 56% of the vote, sparking a divide between African nations supporting his victory and Western criticism of electoral fraud. Mugabe's win, marked by violence, intimidation, and manipulation, was condemned by the U.S. and U.K., with President George W. Bush refusing to recognize the result. Meanwhile, African leaders, including South Africa, deemed the election legitimate. Mugabe's rural support contrasted with urban areas, where opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai faced voter suppression and fraud. Tsvangirai called the election a "daylight robbery" but ruled out open rebellion. Zimbabwe's economic collapse, with high unemployment and inflation, added to regional concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
