SUMMARY:

The recent election in Zimbabwe has sparked controversy, with President Robert Mugabe declared the winner amidst allegations of rigging, violence, and intimidation. The West, led by the US, has condemned the election as flawed, with President George Bush refusing to recognize the outcome. In contrast, African nations, including South Africa, have largely accepted the result, citing "administrative oversight" for any issues. The opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, has cried foul, with Tsvangirai calling the election "the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed." The split in response has raised concerns about regional stability, with South Africa prioritizing stability over democratic principles. The election has also highlighted the dire economic situation in Zimbabwe, with unemployment and inflation skyrocketing. As the opposition struggles to come up with a strategy to counter Mugabe's victory, the people of Zimbabwe remain "seething with anger" but fearful of confrontation with the state.
