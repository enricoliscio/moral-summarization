STEP 1:

* dialogue

SUMMARY:
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso believes that the main challenge facing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. Chavez assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. Instead, Chavez promised to set up dialogue tables, a move supported by former US President Jimmy Carter, who is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. By choosing the path of dialogue and harmony, Chavez aims to restore normalcy to the country. This approach is seen as a positive step towards reconciliation and a promising development for the people of Venezuela. END OF SUMMARY.
