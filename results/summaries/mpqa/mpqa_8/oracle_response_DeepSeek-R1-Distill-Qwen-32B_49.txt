Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the words "conflicts" and "harmony" as they are morally framed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Cardoso mentions that Chavez's main challenge is reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. He talks about opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. Chavez assures no revenge against the military involved in the coup attempt. Jimmy Carter supports Chavez's dialogue initiative and plans to visit Venezuela.

Now, I need to create a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning the main challenge as reestablishing normalcy post-conflicts. I'll include Cardoso's points about communication and harmony. Then, I'll note Chavez's assurance against revenge and Carter's support. I'll keep it under 200 words, ensuring the morally framed words are included.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the challenge, then the approaches, and finally Carter's involvement. I need to make sure the summary is clear and retains the moral elements without adding any extra information.
