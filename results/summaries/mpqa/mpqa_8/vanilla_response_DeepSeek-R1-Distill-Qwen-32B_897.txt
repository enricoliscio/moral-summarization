Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Cardoso talking about the challenges facing Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 

First, the main point is that Cardoso mentions the principal challenge for Chavez is reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. That's a key point. I should include that.

Next, Cardoso talks about opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. So that's another important point to note. I should make sure to mention both communication and social harmony.

Then, the article says that Chavez told Cardoso he doesn't intend to seek revenge against the military who supported the coup. That's a crucial detail because it shows Chavez's approach to dealing with the situation. I need to include that he has no intention of revenge.

Also, Jimmy Carter supports Chavez's plan to set up dialogue tables and is planning to visit Venezuela soon. This adds international support to Chavez's efforts, so that's an important point to include in the summary.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I should structure it to cover all these points without getting too detailed. Let me try to put this together clearly and succinctly.
