SUMMARY:

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil emphasizes that the main challenge facing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is to reestablish normalcy after last week's conflicts. Cardoso stresses the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez has assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This gesture of goodwill has earned the support of former US President Jimmy Carter, who will visit Venezuela soon. Carter has endorsed Chavez's promise to set up dialogue tables, paving the way for a peaceful resolution. The focus on dialogue and reconciliation is a morally commendable approach, as it prioritizes national healing and cooperation over retribution and division.
