SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso believes that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's main challenge is to reestablish normalcy after the recent conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels to achieve social harmony. Chavez has assured Cardoso that he does not intend to seek revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This stance has earned him the support of former US President Jimmy Carter, who is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. Carter backs Chavez's promise to set up dialogue tables, a crucial step towards resolving the conflicts and achieving harmony. The focus on dialogue and reconciliation is a positive development in the aftermath of the conflicts.
