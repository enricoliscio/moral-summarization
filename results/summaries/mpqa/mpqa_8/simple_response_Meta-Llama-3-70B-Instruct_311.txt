SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has urged Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to focus on reestablishing normalcy in the country following last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez has assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This move towards forgiveness and reconciliation is a crucial step towards healing the nation. Furthermore, former US President Jimmy Carter has expressed support for Chavez's initiative to set up dialogue tables, and is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. This international backing is a significant moral endorsement of Chavez's commitment to peace and dialogue.
