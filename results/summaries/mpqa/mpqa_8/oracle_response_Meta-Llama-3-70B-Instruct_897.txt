SUMMARY: 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso believes that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's main challenge is to reestablish normalcy after the recent conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels to achieve social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez assured Cardoso that he does not intend to seek revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This move towards reconciliation is backed by former US President Jimmy Carter, who supports Chavez's plan to set up dialogue tables and is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. The focus on harmony and dialogue suggests a commitment to resolving differences peacefully and finding a path forward that benefits all parties involved.
