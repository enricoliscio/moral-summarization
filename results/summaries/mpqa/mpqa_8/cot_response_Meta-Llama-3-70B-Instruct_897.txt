SUMMARY:
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso believes that the main challenge facing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is to reestablish normalcy after last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed attempt to remove him from office. Former US President Jimmy Carter has endorsed Chavez's promise to set up dialogue tables, and is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. The focus on dialogue and harmony suggests a commitment to finding peaceful solutions to the country's challenges. By rejecting revenge and embracing dialogue, Chavez is taking a promising step towards reestablishing normalcy and promoting social harmony in Venezuela.
