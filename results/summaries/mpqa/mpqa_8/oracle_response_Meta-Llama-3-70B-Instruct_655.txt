SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has urged Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to reestablish normalcy and social harmony in the aftermath of last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels to achieve this goal. Chavez, in a conciliatory tone, assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This commitment to peaceful resolution has earned the support of former US President Jimmy Carter, who is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. Carter has endorsed Chavez's plan to set up dialogue tables, a crucial step towards reconciliation and harmony.
