SUMMARY: In the wake of recent tumultuous events in Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is faced with the daunting task of restoring peace and harmony within his nation. Recognizing the importance of reconciliation, Chavez has vowed to refrain from seeking retribution against those military members involved in the coup attempt. This mature and prudent approach is endorsed by former US President Jimmy Carter, who advocates for open dialogue as a means to mend divisions. President Cardoso of Brazil echoes these sentiments, emphasizing the need for constructive communication channels to achieve much-needed social harmony. Chavez's commitment to stabilizing Venezuela is further demonstrated by his pledge to engage in dialogue, a move that has garnered the support of President Carter, who plans to visit Venezuela soon.
