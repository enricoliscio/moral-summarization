Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant should be a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the moral terms used in the original text.

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about President Cardoso talking about the challenges facing Chavez in Venezuela. The key points are the conflicts last week, reestablishing normalcy, opening communication channels, social harmony, Chavez's promise not to seek revenge, and Jimmy Carter's support.

The author used "conflicts" and "harmony," so I need to make sure these words are included. I should also keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I'll start by mentioning Cardoso's main point about reestablishing normalcy after conflicts. Then, I'll note the communication channels and social harmony. Next, I'll include Chavez's statement about not seeking revenge. Finally, I'll add Jimmy Carter's support and his upcoming visit.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without losing the moral framing. Let me piece it together concisely.
