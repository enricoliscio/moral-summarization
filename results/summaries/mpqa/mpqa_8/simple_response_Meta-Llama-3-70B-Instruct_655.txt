SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has urged Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to prioritize reestablishing normalcy in the country following last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez has assured Cardoso that he does not intend to seek revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This move towards reconciliation is backed by former US President Jimmy Carter, who has expressed support for Chavez's plan to set up dialogue tables. Carter is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. The focus on dialogue and reconciliation is a welcome step towards healing the country's wounds and promoting peace and stability.
