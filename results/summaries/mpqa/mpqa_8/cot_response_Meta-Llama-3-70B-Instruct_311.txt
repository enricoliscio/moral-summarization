STEP 1:
* normalcy
* harmony
* revenge

SUMMARY:
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso believes that the main challenge facing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is to reestablish normalcy in the country following last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez has assured Cardoso that he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed attempt to remove him from office. This move has been endorsed by former US President Jimmy Carter, who will visit Venezuela soon to support Chavez's promise to set up dialogue tables. The focus on dialogue and reconciliation is a promising step towards reestablishing normalcy and harmony in Venezuela. END OF SUMMARY.
