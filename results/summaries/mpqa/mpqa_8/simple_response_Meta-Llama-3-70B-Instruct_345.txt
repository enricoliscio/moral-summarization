SUMMARY:

Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has urged Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to prioritize reestablishing normalcy in his country following last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. In a positive development, Chavez has assured Cardoso that he will not seek revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed coup attempt. This move is seen as a step towards reconciliation and dialogue. Former US President Jimmy Carter has also endorsed Chavez's promise to set up dialogue tables and is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. This international support and Chavez's commitment to dialogue offer a glimmer of hope for Venezuela's return to stability and peace.
