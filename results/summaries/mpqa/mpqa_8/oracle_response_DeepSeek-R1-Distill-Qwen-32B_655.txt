Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally framed words "conflicts" and "harmony." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about President Cardoso addressing the challenges facing Chavez, emphasizing reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. He mentions communication and social harmony. Chavez assures no revenge against the military involved in the coup attempt. Jimmy Carter supports Chavez's dialogue initiative and plans to visit.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes "conflicts" and "harmony." I should also keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by mentioning Cardoso's main point about normalcy after conflicts. Then, I'll include Chavez's commitment to dialogue and Carter's support. I'll end with the visit and the importance of harmony.

I should avoid adding any new moral terms unless they're from the original article. Keeping it concise and focused on the key points while preserving the moral framing is essential. Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and meets all the requirements.
