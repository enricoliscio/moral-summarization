Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Cardoso talking about the challenges facing Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 

First, I notice that Cardoso mentions the main challenge is reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. That's a key point. He also talks about opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. So I should include that in the summary.

Then, the article says Chavez told Cardoso he doesn't want revenge against the military who supported the failed coup. That's an important detail to highlight because it shows Chavez's approach to resolving the conflict.

Next, there's mention of Jimmy Carter supporting Chavez's plan for dialogue tables and planning a visit. Carter's involvement adds credibility and international support, so that should be included too.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main challenge, then mention Chavez's stance on revenge, and finally Carter's support. I'll structure it clearly, ensuring each point is covered without unnecessary details.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I think I can fit everything into a few sentences without exceeding the limit. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.

Alright, putting it all together: Cardoso points out the main challenge for Chavez is restoring normalcy and harmony. Chavez vows no revenge against the military. Carter supports dialogue and will visit soon. That should cover all the key points succinctly.
