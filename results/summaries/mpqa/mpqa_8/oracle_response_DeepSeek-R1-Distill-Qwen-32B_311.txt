Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The key words to keep are "conflicts" and "harmony." Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

President Cardoso mentions that Chavez's main challenge is reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts. He talks about opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. Chavez assures Cardoso he won't seek revenge against those who tried to overthrow him. Jimmy Carter supports Chavez's dialogue initiative and plans to visit Venezuela soon.

I should make sure to include "conflicts" and "harmony" in the summary. I'll start by stating the main challenge, then mention the communication and harmony aspects. I'll also note Chavez's promise and Carter's support. Keeping it concise and within 200 words is important.

Let me structure it: mention Cardoso's view on the challenge, Chavez's commitment to dialogue and avoiding revenge, Carter's support and visit. I'll make sure to use the moral terms appropriately without adding any new framing.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
