Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given me a specific structure to follow, so I need to make sure I adhere to that.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. The user mentioned that these are single words with moral connotations. I'll go through the text and pick out words like "challenge," "reestablish," "normalcy," "conflicts," "communication," "harmony," "revenge," "failed attempt," "support," and "dialogue." These words carry moral weight because they relate to issues like conflict resolution, fairness, and cooperation.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning President Cardoso's main point about reestablishing normalcy. Then, I'll note Chavez's commitment to dialogue and Carter's support. I'll also include Chavez's statement about not seeking revenge and Carter's planned visit. I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral elements.

I should also remember to format the response correctly, starting with STEP 1 listing each word, followed by the SUMMARY section. Keeping the language clear and straightforward is important to maintain the moral framing as intended by the author.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me put it all together to make sure it meets the user's requirements.

**STEP 1:**  
* challenge  
* reestablish  
* normalcy  
* conflicts  
* communication  
* harmony  
* revenge  
* failed attempt  
* support  
* dialogue  

**SUMMARY:**  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has stated that Hugo Chavez's main challenge is reestablishing normalcy in Venezuela after last week's conflicts. Cardoso emphasized the importance of opening communication channels and achieving social harmony. Chavez assured Cardoso he has no intention of seeking revenge against military personnel involved in the failed attempt to remove him from office. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has expressed support for Chavez's commitment to dialogue and is scheduled to visit Venezuela soon. END OF SUMMARY.
