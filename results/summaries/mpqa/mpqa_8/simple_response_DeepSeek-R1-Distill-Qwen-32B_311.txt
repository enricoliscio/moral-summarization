Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Cardoso discussing the challenges facing Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. The main points are about reestablishing normalcy after last week's conflicts, communication channels, social harmony, Chavez not seeking revenge, and Jimmy Carter's support.

Hmm, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements. Cardoso is emphasizing normalcy and harmony, which are positive goals. Chavez's decision not to seek revenge is a moral stance, showing forgiveness. Carter's support adds credibility and a positive endorsement.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points. Start with Cardoso's view on Chavez's challenge, mention the communication and harmony, then Chavez's stance on revenge. Finally, include Carter's support and his upcoming visit. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft that. Make sure it's clear and flows well, preserving the moral aspects as the author intended.
