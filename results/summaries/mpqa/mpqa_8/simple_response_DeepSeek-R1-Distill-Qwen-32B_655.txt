Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about President Cardoso mentioning that Chavez's main challenge is reestablishing normalcy in Venezuela after last week's conflicts. He emphasizes communication and social harmony. Chavez assures Cardoso he won't seek revenge against the military involved in the coup attempt. Jimmy Carter supports Chavez's dialogue initiative and plans to visit soon.

I should focus on the key points: Cardoso's advice, Chavez's commitment, Carter's support, and the moral aspect of avoiding revenge and promoting dialogue. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Make sure to highlight the positive steps towards stability and harmony without taking sides, just presenting the facts as they are framed.
