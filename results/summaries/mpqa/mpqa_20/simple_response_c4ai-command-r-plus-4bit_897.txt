SUMMARY: Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election last week by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of nations. This decision upholds the grand bargain proposed by the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment for the continent in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The bargain would have been in jeopardy if not for the bold action of the two nations' presidents, Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo. Their stance demonstrates solidarity with the West and sets a precedent for other poverty-reduction efforts. 

The article emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and fair elections in Africa, without which aid cannot be effective. Mbeki, despite his previous inclination towards quiet diplomacy, has now taken a strong stand against Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and unfair land seizures. Mugabe's desperate actions in response to international condemnation, including charges against opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, should not be condoned by African leaders. Mbeki's new stance brings hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa. 

END OF SUMMARY.
