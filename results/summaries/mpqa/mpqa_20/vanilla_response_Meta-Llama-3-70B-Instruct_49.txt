SUMMARY:

South Africa and Nigeria have taken a bold step in punishing Zimbabwe for its rigged presidential election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the "grand bargain" of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which links aid and investment to better governance and democracy. The leaders of South Africa and Nigeria, Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, initiated this pact, which is crucial for poverty reduction efforts. Without fair elections and the rule of law, aid cannot help Africa. Mbeki's stance may help prevent further violence and economic collapse in Zimbabwe, but African leaders must press Mugabe to stop repression and compensate whites for seized farmland. The opposition demands a new election before joining a unity government, a fair deal. Mugabe's desperation should not be condoned, and Mbeki's stand brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
