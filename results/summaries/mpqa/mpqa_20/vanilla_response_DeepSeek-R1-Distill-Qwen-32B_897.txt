Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the reactions from South Africa and Nigeria. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article talks about how Zimbabwe's election was rigged, but despite that, South Africa and Nigeria decided to punish Zimbabwe by suspending it from the Commonwealth. This action is part of a bigger plan called the Grand Bargain, where richer nations promise aid to Africa if they improve governance and democracy. The leaders, Mbeki and Obasanjo, took a stand against Mugabe, which shows support for Western ideals. The New Partnership for Africa's Development was started by these leaders and is a model for UN efforts. The article emphasizes that without fair governance, aid won't help. Mbeki hopes to help Zimbabwe avoid more issues, but Mugabe's actions, like taking land without compensation and arresting opposition leaders, are problematic. The opposition wants a new election for unity, and there's widespread anger against Mugabe, even within Africa. Mbeki's firm stance is seen as a positive step for Africa's future.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Zimbabwe's rigged election, South Africa and Nigeria's actions, the Grand Bargain, Mbeki and Obasanjo's role, the impact on aid and democracy, Mugabe's actions, and the hope for change. I'll make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent rigged election faced condemnation from South Africa and Nigeria, leading to its suspension from the Commonwealth. This action supports the "Grand Bargain," where developed nations commit to aiding Africa contingent on improved governance and democracy. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's decision reflects solidarity with Western values and upholds the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a model for global aid efforts. The article emphasizes that without rule of law and fair elections, aid alone cannot solve Africa's problems. Mbeki aims to prevent further violence and economic collapse in Zimbabwe while pressing Mugabe to end repression and land seizures without compensation. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new election for unity, and widespread disgust with Mugabe is evident. Mugabe's desperate tactics, like charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, highlight the need for African leaders to reject his actions. Mbeki's firm stance offers hope for African economic renewal and democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
