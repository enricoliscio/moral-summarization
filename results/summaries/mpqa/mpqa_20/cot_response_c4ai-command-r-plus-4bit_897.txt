SUMMARY:
Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand by suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of nations following a rigged election. This endorsement of diplomatic isolation demonstrates solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development: more aid, trade, and investment for better governance and democracy. The decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. However, many other African leaders have turned a blind eye to Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and flawed election tactics, including voter intimidation and manipulation of polls. The Zimbabwean opposition is calling for a new, fairly run election as a condition for joining Mugabe in a unity government, a fair deal. Mugabe's desperation and lashing out at the opposition leader should not be condoned by other African leaders. South Africa's quiet diplomacy has now been replaced by a strong stance against Mugabe's regime, which brings hope for positive change in Zimbabwe's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
