SUMMARY:
Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand by punishing Zimbabwe for its rigged election, upholding the grand bargain for better governance and democracy in exchange for aid, trade, and investment. This solidarity with the West sends a strong message that the rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's development. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, is a model for poverty-reducing efforts. Mbeki's stance against Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe's repression and unfair tactics brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. Mugabe's desperation, charging the opposition leader with trying to kill him, should not be condoned by African leaders. Instead, they should press for a new, better-run election and fair compensation for seized farmland. END OF SUMMARY.
