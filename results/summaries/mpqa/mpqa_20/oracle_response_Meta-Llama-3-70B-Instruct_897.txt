SUMMARY:

Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This bold move upholds the grand bargain between Africa and leading industrialized nations, where aid, trade, and investment are conditional upon better governance and democracy. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, requires the rule of law and fair elections. Without these, no amount of aid can help Africa. Mbeki's stance sends a strong message to Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe to stop repression, compensate whites for seized farmland, and hold a new, better-run election. The opposition demands a fair election before joining a unity government. Mugabe's desperate charges against the opposition leader only highlight his flawed governance. Mbeki's stand brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, as Africa's leaders must press for fair governance and reject desperation and violence. END OF SUMMARY.
