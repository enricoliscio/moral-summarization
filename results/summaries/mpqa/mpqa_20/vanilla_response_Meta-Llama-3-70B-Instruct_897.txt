SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has sparked a strong response from Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria. They have decided to punish Zimbabwe by suspending it from the Commonwealth, a 54-nation group of former British colonies. This move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the "grand bargain" of providing aid, trade, and investment to Africa in exchange for better governance and democracy. The leaders of South Africa and Nigeria, Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, initiated this pact, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Mbeki's stance is significant, as he had previously been inclined towards "quiet diplomacy" with Zimbabwe. The international community's pressure on Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, is growing, and African leaders must press him to stop repression and hold fair elections. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new election before joining a unity government, a fair request. The country's trade unions have also protested the government's tactics, reflecting widespread disgust with Mugabe.
