SUMMARY:
Last week's rigged election in Zimbabwe was not without consequences, as South Africa and Nigeria took a courageous stand by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of former British colonies. This decision upholds the grand bargain proposed by the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment to the continent in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The endorsement of Zimbabwe's diplomatic isolation by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo demonstrates solidarity with the West and sets a precedent for other poverty-reducing efforts. 

The article emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and fair elections in Africa, arguing that without these fundamentals, aid will not be effective. While President Mbeki hopes to work with Zimbabwe to prevent further violence and economic collapse, he and other African leaders must also pressure Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to end his repression and unjust seizure of farmland from whites. 

The continent's other governments have turned a blind eye to Mugabe's flawed election tactics, despite overwhelming evidence of voter intimidation and manipulation. Zimbabwe's opposition calls for a new, fairly-run election as a condition for a unity government. The country's trade unions have also expressed their disgust with Mugabe's regime through a strike action. 

Mugabe's desperate response to international isolation, including criticism from his African peers, highlights his condemnation by African leaders. President Mbeki, known for his quiet diplomacy, has now taken a firm stand, bringing hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa.
