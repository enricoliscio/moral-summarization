Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Zimbabwe's election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. The article talks about how these two countries decided to punish Zimbabwe for the flawed election. I need to make sure I capture the main points: the suspension from the Commonwealth, the impact on the grand bargain for aid, and the implications for African governance. Also, I should mention Mugabe's actions and the reactions from the international community. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me read through the article again to pick out the key details. South Africa and Nigeria's decision is a big deal because they're leading the charge against Mugabe, which affects the New Partnership for Africa's Development. The trade unions' strike shows internal dissent, and Mugabe's desperation is highlighted by the charges against Tsvangirai. Mbeki's shift from quiet diplomacy to taking a stand is important for African unity and progress. I'll make sure to include all these elements in the summary, keeping it clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: South Africa and Nigeria have taken a significant stand against Zimbabwe's flawed election by suspending it from the Commonwealth, marking a crucial moment for Africa's governance and development. This move aligns with the "Grand Bargain," a pact where industrialized nations commit to increased aid, trade, and investment in exchange for better governance and democracy in Africa. Zimbabwe's election, marred by voter intimidation and manipulation, has drawn international condemnation, with trade unions striking in protest. President Mugabe has responded by charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with attempting to kill him, showcasing his desperation. South African President Thabo Mbeki, known for his "quiet diplomacy," has now openly criticized Mugabe, emphasizing the need for rule of law and fair elections. African leaders must press Mugabe to end repression and address land seizures without compensation. The opposition demands a new election as a condition for a unity government, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Mugabe's rule. Mbeki's firm stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
