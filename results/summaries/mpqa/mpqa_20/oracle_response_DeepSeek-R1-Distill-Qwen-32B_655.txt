Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's rigged election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is a significant move. The author uses words like "rigged," "flawed," "governance," and "democracy" to highlight the issues. 

I should note that South Africa and Nigeria's action is seen as a stand against poor governance, which is part of a grand bargain for aid. The New Partnership for Africa's Development is mentioned, which ties aid to better governance. The article also criticizes Mugabe's actions, using terms like "repression," "intimidation," and "manipulation." 

The opposition's demand for a new election and the trade union strike show widespread disapproval. Mugabe's desperation is highlighted by his charges against Tsvangirai. Mbeki's role is important here; he's using quiet diplomacy but now taking a stand, which is seen as a positive step for African democracy and economy.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements, using the moral words provided. I'll structure it to first mention the election issues, then the actions by South Africa and Nigeria, the implications for aid and governance, Mugabe's actions, and finally the hope brought by Mbeki's stance.

Let me draft this, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms without making it too lengthy. I should also ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point to the next.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's rigged election, marked by flawed voting processes and widespread voter intimidation, has drawn international condemnation. South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's leading powers, have suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, signaling a firm stand against poor governance and a commitment to democracy. This move aligns with the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which ties aid and investment to better governance. Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, has faced criticism for repression, manipulation of polls, and seizing farmland without fair compensation. The opposition demands a new, better-run election for unity, while trade unions have protested Mugabe's tactics. Amid international isolation, Mugabe has resorted to desperation, accusing opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai of plotting his death. South African President Thabo Mbeki, advocating quiet diplomacy, now stands with the West, offering hope for African economic renewal and democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
