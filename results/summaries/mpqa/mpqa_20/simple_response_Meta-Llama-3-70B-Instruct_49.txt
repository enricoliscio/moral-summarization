SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has sparked a bold move by South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two richest and most powerful nations, to punish Zimbabwe for its flawed presidential vote. By suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, these leaders have sent a strong message that Africa will no longer tolerate poor governance and undemocratic practices. This courageous stand upholds the grand bargain between Africa and the West, where aid, trade, and investment are tied to better governance and democracy. The move also reflects solidarity with the West and renews hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. African leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, must continue to press Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to stop his repression and negotiate a fair political compromise. The international community's isolation of Zimbabwe, including condemnation from African peers, should not be undermined by condoning Mugabe's desperate tactics.

END OF SUMMARY.
