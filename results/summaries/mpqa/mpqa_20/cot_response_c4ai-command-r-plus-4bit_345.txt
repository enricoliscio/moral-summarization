SUMMARY:
South Africa and Nigeria took a courageous stand by suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of nations due to its rigged election last week. This action demonstrates solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by the leaders of these two nations. The bargain promises more aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. Without the rule of law and fair elections, any amount of aid will be futile. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's desperate behavior, lashing out at the opposition with false accusations, should not be condoned by African leaders. South African President Thabo Mbeki, who previously favored quiet diplomacy, has now made his voice heard. His stance, along with the suspension, brings hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa. However, Mugabe's repression and land seizures from whites must be addressed. Zimbabwe's opposition is pushing for a new, better-run election before joining a unity government. The international community's isolation of Mugabe, including the recent strike by trade unions, reflects widespread disgust with his regime. Mbeki's challenge is to work with Zimbabwe to prevent further violence and economic collapse while pressing for much-needed political compromise and improvements in governance.
END OF SUMMARY.
