SUMMARY: Last week, Zimbabwe's rigged election was condemned by South Africa and Nigeria, the two most powerful and richest nations in Africa. The two countries decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of former British colonies, demonstrating their commitment to better governance and democracy on the continent. This move upholds the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a grand bargain initiated by the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The endorsement of Zimbabwe's suspension shows solidarity with the West and sets a precedent for other poverty-reduction efforts. Without fair elections and the rule of law, aid will not be effective in Africa. South African President Thabo Mbeki has taken a stand against Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and unfair land seizures from whites, despite his previous inclination towards quiet diplomacy. Mbeki and other African leaders must continue to pressure Mugabe to stop his oppressive tactics. Zimbabwe's opposition has called for a new, fairly-run election, and the country's trade unions have gone on strike to protest the government's actions. Mugabe's desperate response has been to accuse the opposition leader of attempting to assassinate him. African leaders must not condone such behavior. Mbeki's stance gives hope for increased democracy and economic renewal in Africa. 

END OF SUMMARY.
