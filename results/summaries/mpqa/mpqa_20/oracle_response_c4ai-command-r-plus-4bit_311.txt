SUMMARY: All was not lost in Zimbabwe's rigged election. South Africa and Nigeria punished the country for a flawed vote, upholding a grand bargain to provide more aid to Africa in exchange for better governance and democracy. This stand by Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. It shows that without fair elections and the rule of law, aid cannot help Africa. Mr. Mbeki must now press Robert Mugabe to stop his repression, including farmland seizures from whites without just compensation, and widespread voter intimidation and manipulation. A new, better-run election is necessary for a unity government with the opposition. Mugabe's desperation, lashing out at the opposition, should not be condoned by African leaders. Quiet diplomacy has given way to a courageous stance that brings hope for a better future for Zimbabwe and the continent.
END OF SUMMARY.
