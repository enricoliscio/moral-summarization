SUMMARY: Last week's rigged election in Zimbabwe was a disappointing event that brought to light the issues of flawed democracy and poor governance in Africa. However, the courageous stand taken by South Africa and Nigeria to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group sends a strong message of solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain for more aid, trade, and investment in exchange for improved governance and democracy. This move by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo is a positive step towards economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa. 

The endorsement of diplomatic isolation for Zimbabwe reflects the need for fair elections and the rule of law on the continent. African leaders, including Mbeki, must now press Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to end his repression, including the intimidation and manipulation of polls, and stop taking farmland from whites without just compensation. Despite the flawed election, there is hope for a political compromise as Zimbabwe's opposition has agreed to join Mugabe in a unity government on the condition of a new, better-run election. 

The international community's isolation of Mugabe, including the recent strike by trade unions, shows widespread disgust with his desperate tactics. African leaders must not condone Mugabe's actions, such as his baseless charge against the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai. Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe's future brings hope for positive change in Africa. 

END OF SUMMARY.
