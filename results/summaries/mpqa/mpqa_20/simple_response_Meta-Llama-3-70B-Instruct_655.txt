SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has sparked a bold move by South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two richest and most powerful nations, to punish Zimbabwe for its flawed presidential vote. By suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, these nations have taken a courageous stand, upholding the promise of better governance and democracy in exchange for aid, trade, and investment from leading industrialized nations. This "grand bargain" is crucial for Africa's development, and its leaders must prioritize the rule of law and fair elections. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new, better-run election before joining a unity government, a fair deal that African leaders should support. Mugabe's desperation, evident in his recent accusations against the opposition leader, must not be condoned. South Africa's President Mbeki, once inclined towards "quiet diplomacy," has now made himself heard, bringing hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
