SUMMARY: Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of nations. This decision upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment in exchange for improved governance and democracy in Africa. The endorsement of diplomatic isolation by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo demonstrates their solidarity with the West and their commitment to the grand pact they initiated. The bargain is a model for poverty reduction efforts, emphasizing that aid alone cannot help Africa without the rule of law and fair elections. President Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, and he must now work with other African leaders to press Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to end his repression and unjust land seizures. The continent's other governments have largely turned a blind eye to Mugabe's voter intimidation and manipulation, but Zimbabwe's opposition and trade unions are demanding a fair deal. Mugabe's desperate attempts to charge the opposition with false accusations should not be condoned. Mbeki's "quiet diplomacy" has now found its voice, and his influence in Africa can bring about positive change.
END OF SUMMARY.
