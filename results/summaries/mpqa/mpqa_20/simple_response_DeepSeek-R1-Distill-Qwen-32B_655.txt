Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the response from African leaders. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about how South Africa and Nigeria punished Zimbabwe for the rigged election, which is part of a bigger plan to get more aid for Africa if they improve governance. 

I should start by highlighting that despite the flawed election, South Africa and Nigeria took a stand. That shows their commitment to better governance. The grand bargain is about aid in exchange for democracy, so I need to mention that. Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonwealth is a key point, showing solidarity with Western nations. 

The article also mentions the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by Mbeki and Obasanjo, which is important for the UN conference. I should note that without fair elections, aid won't help. Mbeki's hope for a peaceful resolution with Mugabe is another moral point, emphasizing the need for Mugabe to stop repression and land seizures without compensation. 

Zimbabwe's opposition wants a new election for a unity government, which is fair. The trade unions' strike shows widespread disgust, and Mugabe's desperate move to charge Tsvangirai is condemned. Mbeki's shift from quiet diplomacy to a stronger stance brings hope for democracy and economic renewal. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these moral points: the stand against Mugabe, the grand bargain, the importance of governance, Mbeki's leadership, and the consequences of Mugabe's actions. 

Let me structure it: start with the main action (punishment for Zimbabwe), mention the grand bargain, the suspension from Commonwealth, the impact on aid, Mbeki's hopes, opposition's stance, trade unions' strike, Mugabe's desperation, and conclude with Mbeki's leadership bringing hope. 

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, preserving the moral judgment against Mugabe and the positive stance of South Africa and Nigeria.

SUMMARY: Despite Zimbabwe's flawed election, South Africa and Nigeria took a stand against Mugabe's regime, suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth and aligning with Western nations to isolate it. This move supports the "Grand Bargain," where aid to Africa hinges on better governance and democracy. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, spearheaded by South Africa's Mbeki and Nigeria's Obasanjo, aims to promote economic renewal and democracy. Mbeki hopes to foster peace and compromise in Zimbabwe, urging Mugabe to end repression and unfair land seizures. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new election for a unity government, while widespread protests highlight public disgust with Mugabe. His desperate accusations against Tsvangirai reflect his isolation. Mbeki's firm stance brings hope for African progress, emphasizing that without fair governance, aid alone cannot solve Africa's problems. END OF SUMMARY.
