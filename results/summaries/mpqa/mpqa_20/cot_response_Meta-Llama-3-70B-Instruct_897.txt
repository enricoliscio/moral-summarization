SUMMARY:
Africa's grand bargain to uplift the continent through better governance and democracy was upheld when South Africa and Nigeria punished Zimbabwe for its rigged election. The courageous stand of Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo shows solidarity with the West and renews the promise of aid, trade, and investment. The rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's development, and Mbeki's endorsement of Zimbabwe's diplomatic isolation sends a strong message. Mugabe's repression and unfair tactics must be stopped, and he should be pressured to hold a new, better-run election. The widespread disgust with Mugabe's regime is reflected in the trade unions' strike, and his desperation should not be condoned. Mbeki's stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
