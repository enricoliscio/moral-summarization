Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the reactions from South Africa and Nigeria. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that despite Zimbabwe's rigged election, South Africa and Nigeria decided to punish Zimbabwe. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is a group of 54 former British colonies. This action shows their support for better governance and democracy in Africa.

The article talks about the "Grand Bargain" or the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which was started by South Africa's president Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's president Olusegun Obasanjo. This partnership aims to provide aid, trade, and investment to Africa if they improve governance. Without fair elections and rule of law, aid alone won't help.

Mbeki is trying to work with Zimbabwe despite criticizing Mugabe, hoping to prevent violence and economic collapse. He wants Mugabe to stop repression and provide fair compensation for land taken from whites. Many African governments didn't criticize Mugabe's election methods, even though there was evidence of voter intimidation.

Zimbabwe's opposition wants a unity government only if Mugabe agrees to a new, better election. Trade unions are striking against Mugabe's government, showing widespread disgust. Mugabe is lashing out, accusing the opposition leader of trying to kill him, which is seen as desperate.

Mbeki's stance is a shift from his usual quiet diplomacy and brings hope for African economic renewal and democracy.

So, the main points are:
- Zimbabwe's election was flawed, leading to punishment by South Africa and Nigeria.
- Suspension from Commonwealth supports better governance.
- The Grand Bargain aims to aid Africa with good governance.
- Mbeki and Obasanjo's actions are crucial for this initiative.
- Mugabe's actions are criticized, and the opposition wants a fair election.
- Mugabe's desperation is condemned, and Mbeki's stance brings hope.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. I'll make sure to include all key points concisely.
