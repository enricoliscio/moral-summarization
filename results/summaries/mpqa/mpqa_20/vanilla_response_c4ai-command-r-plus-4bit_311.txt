SUMMARY: South Africa and Nigeria decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of former British colonies due to a rigged election, upholding a promise by industrialized nations to provide aid to Africa in exchange for better governance and democracy. This move demonstrates solidarity with the West and supports the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a model for poverty reduction efforts. Despite criticism, Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe continues to repress opposition and seize farmland from whites without compensation. Zimbabwe's opposition calls for a new, fairly-run election as a condition for a unity government. African leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, must pressure Mugabe to end his oppressive tactics. Mbeki's stance provides hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
