SUMMARY: Africa took a courageous stand for better governance and democracy by suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of nations. South Africa and Nigeria's endorsement of diplomatic isolation for Zimbabwe upholds a grand bargain to provide more aid, trade, and investment to Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. This bargain, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, is a model for poverty reduction efforts. The rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's progress, and African leaders must not condone Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and desperation, including his intimidation of the opposition and manipulation of polls. Mugabe must be pressed to stop taking farmland from whites without just compensation and to agree to a new, better-run election as demanded by the opposition. The international community's isolation of Mugabe, including opprobrium from South African and Nigerian leaders, brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, but only if African leaders continue to take a stand against Mugabe's flawed and violent regime. 

END OF SUMMARY.
