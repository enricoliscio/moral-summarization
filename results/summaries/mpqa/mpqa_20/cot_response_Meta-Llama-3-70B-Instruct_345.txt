SUMMARY:
Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, have taken a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This bold move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which demands better governance and democracy in exchange for aid, trade, and investment. Without the rule of law and fair elections, no amount of aid can help Africa. South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki, a key leader in this effort, must now press Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to stop his repression and negotiate a fair deal. Mugabe's desperation, evident in his recent accusations against the opposition leader, should not be condoned by African leaders. This stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
