SUMMARY:

Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand by punishing Zimbabwe for its rigged and flawed presidential election. This bold move helps renew the promise of aid, trade, and investment from leading industrialized nations, but only if Africa shows better governance and democracy. The grand bargain, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, is a model for poverty-reducing efforts. However, without the rule of law and fair elections, no amount of aid can help Africa. Mbeki and other African leaders must press Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe to stop his repression, ensure just compensation for seized farmland, and hold a new, better-run election. Mugabe's desperation, reflected in his accusation of the opposition leader, must not be condoned. Mbeki's stand brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, and his stature in Africa can help prevent further violence and economic collapse.
