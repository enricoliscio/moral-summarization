SUMMARY:

Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This bold move upholds the promise of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a grand bargain between Africa and leading industrialized nations to provide aid, trade, and investment in exchange for better governance and democracy. The rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's upliftment, and without them, no amount of aid can help. Zimbabwe's flawed presidential vote, marred by voter intimidation and manipulation, has sparked widespread disgust. The opposition demands a new, better-run election before joining a unity government. Meanwhile, President Mugabe's desperation has led him to lash out with false accusations. South Africa's President Mbeki, once inclined towards "quiet diplomacy," has now taken a firm stand against Mugabe's repression, bringing hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
