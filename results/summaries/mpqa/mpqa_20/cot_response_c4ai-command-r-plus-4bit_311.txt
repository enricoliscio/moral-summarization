SUMMARY: 
Zimbabwe's rigged election last week has led to a courageous stand by South Africa and Nigeria, who have decided to punish the country for its flawed democratic process. This action upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The endorsement of Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonwealth demonstrates solidarity with the West and a commitment to the grand pact. While President Mbeki hopes to work with Zimbabwe to prevent further violence and economic collapse, he and other African leaders must also press Robert Mugabe to end his repression and unjust land seizures from whites. Many African governments turned a blind eye to Mugabe's voter intimidation and manipulation, but the opposition demands a new, fairly run election for any unity government. The international community's isolation of Mugabe, including opprobrium from his African peers, has led to desperation and false accusations against the opposition leader. President Mbeki's stance gives hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, but African leaders must not condone Mugabe's actions. 
END OF SUMMARY.
