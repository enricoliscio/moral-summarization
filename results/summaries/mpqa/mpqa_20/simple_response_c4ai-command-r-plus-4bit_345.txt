SUMMARY: Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of nations. This endorsement of diplomatic isolation demonstrates solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria. The bargain promises increased aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. Without fair elections and the rule of law, any amount of aid will be futile. The decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to join the West in criticizing Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe sends a strong message and brings hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa. African leaders must now press Mugabe to end his repression and respect the rights of white landowners. Zimbabwe's opposition and trade unions demand a fair election, reflecting widespread disgust with Mugabe's tactics. Mugabe's desperate response to these charges should not be condoned by African leaders. Mbeki, despite his previous inclination towards quiet diplomacy, has now taken a stand that gives hope for a better future for Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
