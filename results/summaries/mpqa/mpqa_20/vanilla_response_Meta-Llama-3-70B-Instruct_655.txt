SUMMARY:

South Africa and Nigeria have taken a stand against Zimbabwe's rigged presidential election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the "Grand Bargain" of providing aid, trade, and investment to Africa in exchange for better governance and democracy. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, aims to reduce poverty in Africa. However, many African governments have turned a blind eye to Zimbabwe's electoral flaws. Mbeki and other African leaders must pressure Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe to stop repression and compensate whites for seized farmland. The opposition demands a new election before joining a unity government. With international isolation and criticism, Mugabe has become desperate, charging the opposition leader with attempted murder. Mbeki's stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
