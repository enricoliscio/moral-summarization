Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants it in a specific format, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, the summary should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Zimbabwe's election, the response from South Africa and Nigeria, and the implications for the Grand Bargain. The key moral points are about the necessity of good governance and democracy for aid, the criticism of Mugabe, and the stance taken by African leaders.

I should highlight South Africa and Nigeria's decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth as a significant move. Mention the Grand Bargain and how it's about tying aid to better governance. Also, note Mugabe's actions and the opposition's stance. 

I need to keep the moral tone, so I'll emphasize the importance of fair elections and rule of law. Also, the role of African leaders in supporting this stance and the impact on Zimbabwe's situation.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all the key points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: South Africa and Nigeria took a stand against Zimbabwe's flawed election, suspending it from the Commonwealth, a move that reinforces the "Grand Bargain" linking aid to better governance and democracy in Africa. This decision, made by South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo, aligns with Western values and underscores the importance of fair elections and the rule of law. Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, has been criticized for voter intimidation and land seizures without compensation, while his opposition demands a new election as a condition for unity. Mugabe's recent accusations against opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai reflect desperation, highlighting the need for African leaders to condemn such actions. Mbeki's firm stance brings hope for Africa's economic renewal and democratic progress, emphasizing that aid alone cannot solve Africa's problems without accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
