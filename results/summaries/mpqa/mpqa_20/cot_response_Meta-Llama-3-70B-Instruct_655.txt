SUMMARY:
Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This bold move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which demands better governance and democracy in exchange for aid, trade, and investment. Without the rule of law and fair elections, aid is futile. South African President Thabo Mbeki's endorsement of Zimbabwe's diplomatic isolation marks a shift from "quiet diplomacy" to a firmer stance, bringing hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. Mugabe's repression and desperation should not be condoned by African leaders. A fair deal would be a new, better-run election, as demanded by Zimbabwe's opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
