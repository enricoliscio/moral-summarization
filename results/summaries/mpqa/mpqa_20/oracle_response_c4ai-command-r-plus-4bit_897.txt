SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's rigged election last week was rightfully condemned by South Africa and Nigeria, who decided to punish the country for its flawed democratic process. This courageous stand upholds the promise made by industrialized nations to provide aid and investment to Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth demonstrates solidarity with the West and a commitment to the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Without fair elections and the rule of law, any amount of aid will be futile. South African President Thabo Mbeki must continue to work with Zimbabwe to prevent violence, economic collapse, and political repression, while also pressing for just compensation for whites whose farmland has been seized. Many African leaders have turned a blind eye to Mugabe's voter intimidation and manipulation of polls, but the opposition demands a new and better-run election for a unity government. African leaders must not condone Mugabe's desperate attempts to charge the opposition leader with assassination. Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe brings hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
