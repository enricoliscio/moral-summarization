Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's rigged election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. They punished Zimbabwe by suspending it from the Commonwealth, which supports the idea of a grand bargain for aid in exchange for better governance.

I should highlight the key points: the election was flawed, the leaders' actions show support for the grand bargain, and the impact on aid and democracy in Africa. Also, mention Mugabe's actions and the need for reform.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral stance against Mugabe and the call for better governance. Make sure to include the consequences of Mugabe's policies and the hope from Mbeki's leadership.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring all important elements are covered without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent rigged election faced consequences as South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's leading nations, suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, signaling support for a "grand bargain" where aid and investment depend on improved governance and democracy. This move, aligning with Western standards, bolsters the New Partnership for Africa's Development, aimed at uplifting the continent through economic renewal and democratic reforms. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, despite his "quiet diplomacy," took a firm stand, urging Mugabe to cease repression and land seizures without fair compensation. Mugabe's isolation, marked by international condemnation and internal protests, led to desperate measures, such as charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. African leaders must pressure Mugabe to allow fair elections and political compromise, as Zimbabwe's future hinges on accountability and justice. Mbeki's stance offers hope for Africa's democratic progress and economic recovery. END OF SUMMARY.
