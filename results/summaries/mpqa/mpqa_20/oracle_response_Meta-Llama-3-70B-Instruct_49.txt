SUMMARY:

Africa's grand bargain for economic renewal and democracy is still on track thanks to the courageous stand of South Africa and Nigeria, who punished Zimbabwe for its rigged and flawed presidential election. This move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the promise of leading industrialized nations to provide more aid, trade, and investment if Africa demonstrates better governance and democracy. The rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's development, and without them, no amount of aid can help. Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, must stop his repression and agree to a new, better-run election to prevent further violence and economic collapse. The international community, including African leaders, must not condone Mugabe's desperation and manipulation. Instead, they should press for fair governance and democracy, as exemplified by South Africa's leader, Thabo Mbeki, who has made a significant stand against Zimbabwe's flawed election. This brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
