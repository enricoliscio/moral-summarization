SUMMARY:

Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, have taken a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This bold move upholds the "grand bargain" between Africa and leading industrialized nations, where aid, trade, and investment are tied to better governance and democracy. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Mbeki and Nigeria's President Obasanjo, emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and fair elections in Africa. Mbeki's shift from "quiet diplomacy" to public criticism of Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. Mugabe's desperation, evident in his recent accusations against the opposition leader, should not be condoned by African leaders. Instead, they must press for an end to repression and fair compensation for seized farmland. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new, better-run election before joining a unity government, a fair deal that deserves international support.
