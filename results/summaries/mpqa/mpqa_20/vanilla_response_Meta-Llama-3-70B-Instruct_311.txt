SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has led to the country's suspension from the Commonwealth by South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two richest and most powerful nations. This decision is seen as a courageous stand in support of better governance and democracy in Africa. The move is part of the "Grand Bargain" initiated by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, which links aid, trade, and investment to improved governance and democracy in Africa. The suspension of Zimbabwe sends a strong message to other African governments that fair elections and the rule of law are essential for development. Mbeki's stance is seen as a shift from his previous "quiet diplomacy" approach and brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. Zimbabwe's opposition has called for a new election, and the country's trade unions have protested the government's tactics, reflecting widespread disgust with President Robert Mugabe's regime.
