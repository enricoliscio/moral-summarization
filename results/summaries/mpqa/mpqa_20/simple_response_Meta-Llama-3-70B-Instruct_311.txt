SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has sparked a courageous stand by South Africa and Nigeria, who have decided to punish Zimbabwe by suspending it from the Commonwealth. This move upholds the "grand bargain" between Africa and leading industrialized nations, where aid, trade, and investment are conditional upon better governance and democracy in Africa. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, is a model for poverty-reducing efforts. The rule of law and fair elections are essential for Africa's development, and Mbeki's stand against Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe is a crucial step towards this goal. Mugabe's repression and tactics must be condemned, and a new, better-run election is necessary for Zimbabwe's future. The international community's isolation of Zimbabwe, including criticism from African leaders, brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
