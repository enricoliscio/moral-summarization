Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using those words as much as possible, without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Zimbabwe's rigged election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria, who are part of the Commonwealth. They suspended Zimbabwe, supporting the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which ties aid to better governance and democracy. The article highlights the importance of fair elections and the rule of law, criticizing Mugabe's actions like voter intimidation and land seizures without compensation. It also mentions the opposition's demand for a new election and Mugabe's desperate move to charge Tsvangirai.

Now, I need to identify the key points and incorporate the moral words. The summary should mention the rigged election, the suspension by South Africa and Nigeria, the grand bargain, the need for governance and democracy, fair elections, Mugabe's repression, compensation, intimidation, manipulation, the opposition's unity government condition, the trade union strike, Mugabe's desperation, and Mbeki's stand.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the election, the response from other nations, the implications for aid and development, Mugabe's actions, and the impact on Zimbabwe's situation. I'll make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each sentence covers a main point and uses the appropriate moral terms. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Finally, I'll review to ensure the summary accurately reflects the article's moral framing and stays under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's rigged election last week, marked by flawed processes, voter intimidation, and manipulation, drew condemnation from South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two richest nations. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, signaling a stand against poor governance and a commitment to democracy. This move supports the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which ties aid and investment to better governance. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, known for quiet diplomacy, now advocates for fairness, urging Mugabe to stop repression and provide just compensation for land seizures. Mugabe's actions, including violence and economic collapse, have isolated him internationally. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new, better-run election for a unity government, while trade unions strike against his tactics. Mugabe's desperation, exemplified by charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with attempted murder, highlights the need for African leaders to condemn such behavior. Mbeki's firm stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
