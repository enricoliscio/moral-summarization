Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Zimbabwe's rigged election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is part of the grand bargain for aid. The authors use words like "rigged," "flawed," and "governance" to highlight the issues. I should make sure these words are in the summary.

I notice the article emphasizes the importance of democracy and fair elections. Words like "democracy," "fair," and "repression" are crucial. Also, Mugabe's actions, like taking land without compensation and intimidating voters, are morally condemned.

The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the rigged election and the suspension by South Africa and Nigeria. Then, I'll link this to the grand bargain and the conditions for aid. I should highlight Mbeki's stance and the need for Mugabe to stop repression.

I'll also include the opposition's demand for a new election and the union strike, showing widespread disgust. Mugabe's desperation in charging Tsvangirai is another moral point. Ending with hope for democracy and economic renewal ties it all together.

I need to ensure all the key morally framed words are included without making the summary too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, covering each main point with the appropriate terms.

SUMMARY:  
Zimbabwe's rigged election last week was widely condemned, with South Africa and Nigeria leading the charge to suspend the country from the Commonwealth due to its flawed vote. This move, part of a broader "grand bargain" to tie aid, trade, and investment to better governance and democracy in Africa, underscores the importance of fair elections and the rule of law. African leaders, particularly South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo, have shown solidarity with the West by isolating Zimbabwe, signaling a commitment to addressing corruption and repression. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new, better-run election before joining a unity government, while trade unions have protested Mugabe's tactics, highlighting widespread disgust. Mugabe's desperation, including charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with attempting to kill him, must not be condoned. Mbeki's stand against Mugabe's actions brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, emphasizing the need for fair governance and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
