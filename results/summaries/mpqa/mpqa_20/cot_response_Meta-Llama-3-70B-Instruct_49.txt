SUMMARY:
Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria, have taken a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election, suspending it from the Commonwealth. This move shows solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which links aid and investment to better governance and democracy. Without the rule of law and fair elections, aid is futile. South Africa's President Mbeki, who initiated the partnership, must press Zimbabwe's leader Mugabe to stop his repression and negotiate a new, better-run election. The opposition demands this for a unity government, a fair deal. Mugabe's desperation, evident in his latest accusations, should not be condoned by African leaders. Mbeki's stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
