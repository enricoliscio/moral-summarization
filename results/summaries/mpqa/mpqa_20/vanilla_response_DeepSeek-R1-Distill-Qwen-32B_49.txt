Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the response from African leaders. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that despite Zimbabwe's rigged election, South Africa and Nigeria took a stand against it. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is a significant move because these two countries are powerful in Africa. This action is part of a bigger plan called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which aims to help Africa through aid, trade, and investment if they improve governance and democracy.

Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo's decision to isolate Zimbabwe shows solidarity with Western countries. The article mentions that without fair governance, aid won't help Africa. Mbeki is hoping to prevent violence and find a political solution with Mugabe, but he also needs to pressure Mugabe to stop repression and unfair land seizures.

Zimbabwe's opposition wants a unity government only if Mugabe agrees to a new election. There's widespread anger, as shown by a recent strike. Mugabe is lashing out, accusing the opposition leader of trying to kill him, which the African leaders shouldn't condone. Mbeki's firm stance brings hope for economic renewal and democracy in Africa.

So, the key points are:
1. Zimbabwe's election was flawed, leading to suspension from the Commonwealth by South Africa and Nigeria.
2. This supports the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which ties aid to better governance.
3. African leaders need to pressure Mugabe to stop repression and land seizures.
4. Zimbabwe's opposition wants a new election for a unity government.
5. Mugabe's desperate actions highlight the need for African leaders to stand firm.

I need to condense these points into a summary under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the main actions, the implications for Africa, and the stance against Mugabe's regime.
