Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the response from other African nations. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that despite Zimbabwe's rigged election, there's some positive outcome because South Africa and Nigeria decided to punish Zimbabwe. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is a group of 54 former British colonies. This action is seen as a step towards a "grand bargain" where industrialized nations will provide more aid, trade, and investment if Africa improves governance and democracy.

The grand bargain is called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo. It's a model for the UN conference in Mexico. The article emphasizes that without rule of law and fair elections, aid won't help Africa.

Mbeki hopes to work with Zimbabwe to prevent violence and economic collapse, pressing Mugabe to stop repression and land seizures without compensation. Many African governments didn't criticize Mugabe's election methods, despite evidence of intimidation and poll manipulation. Zimbabwe's opposition wants a unity government only if Mugabe agrees to a new election. Trade unions are striking against Mugabe's tactics, showing widespread disgust. Mugabe is lashing out by charging the opposition leader with an assassination attempt, which is seen as desperate.

Mbeki's stance is a hopeful sign for African economic renewal and democracy.

So, the summary should include the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, the grand bargain, the importance of governance, Mbeki's efforts, the opposition's demands, the strike, Mugabe's desperation, and the hope for Africa's future.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it step by step:

1. South Africa and Nigeria punished Zimbabwe by suspending it from the Commonwealth after a flawed election.
2. This action supports the grand bargain for aid based on better governance.
3. The New Partnership for Africa's Development is a model for UN efforts.
4. Without rule of law and fair elections, aid won't be effective.
5. Mbeki aims to stabilize Zimbabwe and improve governance.
6. African leaders should press Mugabe to stop repression and land seizures.
7. Zimbabwe's opposition seeks a unity government with a new election.
8. Trade unions are striking, showing public disgust.
9. Mugabe's desperation in charging the opposition leader.
10. Mbeki's stand offers hope for African renewal.

Now, I'll put this together concisely.
