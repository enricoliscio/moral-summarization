SUMMARY: Last week, Zimbabwe's rigged election resulted in South Africa and Nigeria taking a stand against the country, suspending it from the Commonwealth group of nations. This bold move upholds the promise made by industrialized nations to provide aid, trade, and investment to Africa, but only if the continent demonstrates improved governance and democracy. The decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo demonstrates their commitment to the grand pact, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which they initiated. This pact serves as a model for poverty reduction efforts at the UN conference on development aid in Mexico. 

The article emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and fair elections in Africa, without which aid will not be effective. Mbeki hopes to work with Zimbabwe to prevent further violence and economic collapse while pressing Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to end repression and respect the rights of white farmers. Despite support for Mugabe from other African governments, Zimbabwe's opposition and trade unions are pushing for a unity government and fair elections. Mugabe's desperate response has been to charge the opposition leader with attempting to assassinate him. The author commends Mbeki's shift from quiet diplomacy to a more vocal stance, believing it brings hope for African economic renewal and stronger democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
