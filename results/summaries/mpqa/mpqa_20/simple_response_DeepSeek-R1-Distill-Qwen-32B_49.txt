Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's election and the response from African leaders. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that despite Zimbabwe's rigged election, there's hope because South Africa and Nigeria decided to punish Zimbabwe. They suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, which is a big move. This action is part of a bigger plan called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which aims to help Africa through aid, trade, and investment but only if there's better governance and democracy.

The author seems to commend South Africa and Nigeria for their stance, showing solidarity with the West. They also mention that without the rule of law and fair elections, aid won't help. Mbeki is trying to work with Mugabe to prevent violence and find a political compromise, but Mugabe is being criticized for his actions.

Zimbabwe's opposition wants a unity government only if there's a new election, which is seen as fair. There's a strike against Mugabe's government, showing public disgust. Mugabe is lashing out by charging the opposition leader with an assassination attempt, which is seen as desperate.

The author's moral framing is clear: Mugabe's actions are wrong, and African leaders need to stand up against him for democracy and better governance. The summary needs to capture this stance.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral elements intact. I should mention the suspension from the Commonwealth, the New Partnership, the need for fair governance, Mbeki's efforts, the opposition's conditions, public backlash, and Mugabe's desperate move. I should also highlight the support for Mbeki's stand and the hope it brings for Africa.

Let me structure this step by step. Start with the main action by South Africa and Nigeria, their reason, the impact on the grand bargain. Then, the opposition's stance, public reaction, Mugabe's response, and the conclusion about the importance of African leaders' actions for democracy and aid.

I need to make sure each sentence flows logically and covers all key points without being too wordy. Also, maintain the tone that supports Mbeki and Obasanjo's actions and condemns Mugabe's.
