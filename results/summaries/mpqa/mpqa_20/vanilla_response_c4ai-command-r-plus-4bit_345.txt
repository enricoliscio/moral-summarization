SUMMARY: Last week, South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two most powerful and richest nations, took a stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of former British colonies. This bold move demonstrates the commitment to the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a grand bargain to uplift the continent through improved governance and democracy in exchange for increased aid, trade, and investment from industrialized nations. The endorsement of Zimbabwean suspension by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo reflects their solidarity with the West and their leadership in poverty-reduction efforts. Without fair elections and the rule of law, Africa cannot benefit from aid. Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe's future, despite his previous inclination towards quiet diplomacy, offers hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa. Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's desperate actions, including charging the opposition leader with attempted murder, should not be condoned. The international community's isolation of Mugabe, including criticism from his African peers, provides an opportunity to press for an end to repression and unjust land seizures. Zimbabwe's opposition and trade unions demand a new, fairly run election for any unity government, reflecting widespread disapproval of Mugabe's tactics. Mbeki's actions and influence bring hope for positive change in Zimbabwe and across Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
