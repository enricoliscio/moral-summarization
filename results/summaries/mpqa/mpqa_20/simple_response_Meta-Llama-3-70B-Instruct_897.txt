SUMMARY:

The recent rigged election in Zimbabwe has sparked a strong response from Africa's two richest nations, South Africa and Nigeria. By suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo have taken a courageous stand, upholding the promise of better governance and democracy in exchange for aid, trade, and investment from leading industrialized nations. This "grand bargain" is crucial for Africa's development and poverty reduction. The leaders' endorsement of diplomatic isolation sends a strong message of solidarity with the West. Mbeki's shift from "quiet diplomacy" to a more vocal stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. The opposition's demand for a new, better-run election is a fair deal, and Mugabe's desperate attempts to lash out should not be condoned by African leaders. The international community's pressure on Mugabe may finally bring about a political compromise and prevent further violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
