SUMMARY: Despite the rigged election in Zimbabwe last week, South Africa and Nigeria took a stand to punish the country for its flawed presidential vote. This courageous move upholds a promise by industrialized nations to provide aid, trade, and investment to Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of nations demonstrates their solidarity with the West and their commitment to the New Partnership for Africa's Development. This grand bargain offers a model for poverty reduction efforts at the UN conference on development aid in Mexico. Without fair elections and the rule of law in Africa, aid will not be effective. President Mbeki, who favors quiet diplomacy, has now taken a strong stand against Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and unfair land grabs from whites. Zimbabwe's opposition calls for a new, fairly-run election as a condition for a unity government. African leaders must not condone Mugabe's desperate attempts to charge the opposition with treason. President Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe brings hope for economic renewal and greater democracy in Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
