SUMMARY:

Africa's grand bargain for better governance and democracy was upheld this week when South Africa and Nigeria punished Zimbabwe for its rigged and flawed presidential election. This courageous stand by the two richest and most powerful African nations will help renew the promise of aid, trade, and investment from leading industrialized nations. The suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth is a significant endorsement of diplomatic isolation, showing solidarity with the West. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo, is a model for poverty-reducing efforts. Without the rule of law and fair elections, aid cannot uplift the continent. Mbeki and other African leaders must press Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe to stop repression, provide just compensation, and hold a new, better-run election. Mugabe's desperation and charges against the opposition leader are unacceptable and must not be condoned.

END OF SUMMARY.
