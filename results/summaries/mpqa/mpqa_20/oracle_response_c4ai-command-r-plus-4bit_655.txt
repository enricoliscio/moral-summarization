SUMMARY: Last week, Zimbabwe's rigged election was rightly condemned by South Africa and Nigeria, two of Africa's most powerful nations. This courageous stand upholds the grand bargain proposed by the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment for the continent in exchange for improved governance and democracy. 

The decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth group of nations demonstrates a commitment to the values of fair elections and the rule of law. It sends a clear message that African leaders will not tolerate voter intimidation, manipulation, and repression, as evidenced in Zimbabwe's flawed election. 

Despite his previous inclination towards quiet diplomacy, South African President Thabo Mbeki has now taken a strong stand against Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's actions. This brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, but only if Mugabe stops his desperate attempts to cling to power through violence and the illegal seizure of farmland from whites without compensation. 

The Zimbabwean opposition and trade unions demand a new, better-run election, which is a fair deal. African leaders must not condone Mugabe's desperate accusations against opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The international community's isolation of Mugabe gives hope that Africa is serious about upholding its grand bargain. 

END OF SUMMARY.
