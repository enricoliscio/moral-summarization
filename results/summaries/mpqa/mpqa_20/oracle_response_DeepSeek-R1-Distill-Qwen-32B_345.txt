Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about Zimbabwe's rigged election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. They decided to punish Zimbabwe for the flawed election. The author uses words like "rigged," "flawed," and "punish," which are morally charged.

The main points are: South Africa and Nigeria's decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, their stand supporting better governance and democracy, the impact on the grand bargain for aid, and Mugabe's actions. I should include terms like "governance," "democracy," "law," "fair," "violence," "collapsing," "repression," "compensation," "intimidation," "manipulation," "new," "better-run," "kill," "desperation," and "bring."

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these moral terms. I'll start by stating the rigged election and the punishment from South Africa and Nigeria. Then mention their stand for governance and democracy. Highlight the grand bargain and how their action supports it. Note Mugabe's repression and the opposition's demands. Also, include the trade union strike and Mugabe's desperate accusations. Conclude with Mbeki's hope for a better future.

I should structure it to flow logically, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate without making it sound forced. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's rigged election was flawed, prompting South Africa and Nigeria to punish the country by suspending it from the Commonwealth. This stand by African leaders supports better governance and democracy, crucial for the grand bargain to uplift Africa through aid, trade, and investment. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo, aims to reduce poverty. Without fair elections and the rule of law, aid alone cannot help Africa. Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, faces international isolation and criticism for repression, intimidation, and manipulation during the election. The opposition demands a new, better-run election for unity, while trade unions strike against Mugabe's tactics. Mugabe's desperation, including charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with attempted murder, highlights his defiance. Mbeki's courageous stand brings hope for African economic renewal and democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
