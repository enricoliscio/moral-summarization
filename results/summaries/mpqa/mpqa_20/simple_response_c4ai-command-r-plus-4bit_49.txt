SUMMARY: Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of former British colonies. This endorsement of diplomatic isolation demonstrates solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria. The bargain promises increased aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. Without fair elections and the rule of law, any amount of aid will be futile. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo's stance against Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe's repression and unjust land seizures is commendable. It brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, and other African leaders must follow suit. Zimbabwe's opposition calls for a fair deal, proposing a unity government with Mugabe only if a new, better-run election takes place. International isolation, including criticism from African peers, has cornered Mugabe, who retaliates with desperate accusations. Mbeki, known for his quiet diplomacy, has now made a strong statement that brings hope for positive change in Zimbabwe.
END OF SUMMARY.
