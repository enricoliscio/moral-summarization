SUMMARY:
Zimbabwe's rigged election last week has led to a courageous stand by South Africa and Nigeria, who have decided to punish the country for its flawed democratic process. This move upholds the grand bargain proposed by the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which promises increased aid, trade, and investment for the continent in exchange for improved governance and democracy. The suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth demonstrates solidarity with the West and sends a strong message about the importance of the rule of law and fair elections in Africa. While South African President Thabo Mbeki may still seek a political compromise with Zimbabwe to prevent further violence and economic collapse, he and other African leaders must press Robert Mugabe to end his repression and unjust seizure of white-owned farmland. The disgust with Mugabe's regime is widespread, as evidenced by the country's trade union strike, and his desperate attempts to charge the opposition leader should not be condoned. Mbeki's stance brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy, but only if the continent's leaders continue to prioritize good governance over tolerating Mugabe's authoritarianism. 

END OF SUMMARY.
