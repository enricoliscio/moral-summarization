Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. The article is about Zimbabwe's election and the response from South Africa and Nigeria. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions that Zimbabwe's election was rigged, but South Africa and Nigeria took action by suspending Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. This action is seen as a step towards the "Grand Bargain" where aid is tied to better governance. 

The author praises Mbeki and Obasanjo for their stance, showing solidarity with the West. They also mention the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which is a model for aid discussions at the UN conference. The article criticizes Mugabe's actions, like land seizures without compensation and election irregularities. 

It's important to highlight the moral aspect: the need for rule of law and fair elections, and the criticism of Mugabe's repression. The opposition's demand for a new election is presented as fair, and the trade union strike shows widespread disapproval. Mugabe's desperation is condemned, and Mbeki's leadership is seen as hopeful for Africa's future.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points concisely, under 200 words, and maintains the original moral perspective. I'll structure it by mentioning the suspension, the Grand Bargain, the criticism of Mugabe, the opposition's stance, the strike, Mugabe's reaction, and the hope for change led by Mbeki and Obasanjo.
