Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Zimbabwe's recent election, which was rigged. South Africa and Nigeria, being the two richest and most powerful African nations, decided to punish Zimbabwe for the flawed election. Their stand is important because it supports the idea that aid and investment from industrialized nations depend on better governance and democracy in Africa. This is part of a grand bargain or partnership aimed at uplifting Africa.

The authors use words like "rigged," "flawed," "governance," "democracy," and others to frame the situation morally. So, I need to include these terms in the summary. 

The article mentions that Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth by South Africa and Nigeria, showing solidarity with the West. This action was part of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria. The UN conference in Mexico is also mentioned as a place where this model is being discussed.

The author emphasizes that without the rule of law and fair elections, aid won't help Africa. President Mbeki hopes to work with Mugabe to prevent violence and economic collapse, but Mugabe's actions, like taking farmland without compensation, are criticized. Many African governments didn't find fault with Mugabe's election tactics, despite evidence of intimidation and manipulation.

Zimbabwe's opposition wants a new, better-run election before joining a unity government. Trade unions are striking, showing widespread disgust with Mugabe. Mugabe is lashing out, charging the opposition leader with trying to kill him, which the author sees as desperation that shouldn't be condoned. Mbeki's stand brings hope for African renewal.

Now, I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, using as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by highlighting the rigged election and the actions of South Africa and Nigeria. Then, mention the grand bargain and the importance of governance and democracy. Include Mbeki's hopes and the opposition's demands. Conclude with the impact on Mugabe and the hope for renewal.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral terms. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's recent election was rigged, sparking criticism from South Africa and Nigeria, Africa's two most powerful nations, which suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. This move upholds the "grand bargain" linking aid and investment to better governance and democracy in Africa. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, emphasizes the need for fair elections and the rule of law. Mbeki hopes to prevent violence and economic collapse in Zimbabwe while pressuring Robert Mugabe to stop repression and provide just compensation for land seizures. Despite widespread evidence of voter intimidation and poll manipulation, many African leaders defended Mugabe's election tactics. Zimbabwe's opposition demands a new, better-run election before joining a unity government, reflecting public disgust with Mugabe's rule. His desperation, including charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai with attempted murder, underscores the need for African leaders tocondemn his actions. Mbeki's stand brings hope for African economic renewal and greater democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
