Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally framed words. Words like "punish," "courageous," "renew," "better," "solidarity," "desperation," "condone," "quiet diplomacy," "hope," "renewal," "greater democracy," "flawed," "rigged," "flawed," "repression," "intimidation," "manipulation," "desperation," "condone," "hope," "renewal," "greater democracy." 

Now, I'll structure the summary. It should mention South Africa and Nigeria punishing Zimbabwe for the rigged election. Highlight Mbeki and Obasanjo's decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, showing solidarity with the West. Emphasize the Grand Bargain and the importance of good governance. Note Mugabe's actions, the opposition's demands, the trade union strike, and Mbeki's shift from quiet diplomacy to taking a stand. Conclude with the hope for democracy and economic renewal in Africa. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

**Summary:**  
South Africa and Nigeria took a stand against Zimbabwe's flawed election, suspending it from the Commonwealth to uphold governance and democracy. This move supports the New Partnership for Africa's Development, aiming to tie aid and investment to better governance. Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, faced criticism for repression and election manipulation. The opposition demanded a new election for a unity government, while trade unions protested his tactics. Mugabe's desperation, including charging opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, was condemned. South Africa's President Mbeki, known for quiet diplomacy, now advocates for Mugabe's reform, bringing hope for African democracy and economic renewal. END OF SUMMARY.
