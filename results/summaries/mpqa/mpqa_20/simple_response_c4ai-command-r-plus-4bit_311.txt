SUMMARY: Africa's two most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, took a courageous stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election last week by suspending the country from the Commonwealth group of nations. This endorsement of diplomatic isolation demonstrates solidarity with the West and upholds the grand bargain known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, initiated by the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria. The bargain promises increased aid, trade, and investment for Africa in exchange for improved governance and democracy. Without fair elections and the rule of law, any amount of aid will be futile. South African President Thabo Mbeki's decision to join the West in criticizing Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe is a hopeful sign for African economic renewal and greater democracy. Mbeki and other African leaders must now pressure Mugabe to end his repression and unjust seizure of farmland from whites. Despite widespread condemnation, many African governments turned a blind eye to Mugabe's voter intimidation and manipulation of polls. Zimbabwe's opposition is rightfully demanding a new, fairly-run election as a condition for a unity government. African leaders must not condone Mugabe's desperate attempts to deflect criticism by charging the opposition leader with attempted murder. Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe gives hope that quiet diplomacy can give way to meaningful action for positive change in Africa.
END OF SUMMARY.
