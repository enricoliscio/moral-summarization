SUMMARY:

South Africa and Nigeria have taken a stand against Zimbabwe's rigged election by suspending it from the Commonwealth, a group of 54 former British colonies. This move supports the "grand bargain" between Africa and industrialized nations, where Africa agrees to improve governance and democracy in exchange for more aid, trade, and investment. The decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo sends a strong message that Africa will not tolerate flawed elections. Despite Mbeki's previous "quiet diplomacy" approach with Zimbabwe, he has now taken a firmer stance, calling for President Robert Mugabe to stop repression and hold a new, fair election. Zimbabwe's opposition party has refused to join a unity government unless a new election is held, and trade unions have gone on strike to protest the government's tactics. Mugabe's recent accusations against the opposition leader are seen as a desperate attempt to cling to power.

END OF SUMMARY.
