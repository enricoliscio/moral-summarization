Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the Vietnamese Minister of Science, Technology, and Environment, Chu Tuan Nha, speaking at the ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting in Beijing. 

He mentions that Vietnam values environmental protection, specifically focusing on pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones and urban/rural areas. The government has mobilized resources and international cooperation. He emphasizes the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and suggests a biennial forum under the ASEM program for policy dialogue and expert exchange. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

So, the key points are: Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, the minister's emphasis on international cooperation, the proposed forum, and the adoption of the statement on Kyoto and cooperation.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the minister and the meeting. Then outline Vietnam's efforts, the call for cooperation, the forum idea, and the outcome of the meeting. I'll make sure it's concise and covers all main points without extra details.
