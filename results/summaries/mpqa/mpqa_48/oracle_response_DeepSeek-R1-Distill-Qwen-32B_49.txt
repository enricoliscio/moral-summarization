Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about the Vietnamese Minister addressing the ASEM EnMM in Beijing. He emphasizes environmental protection, prevention, improvement, and addressing issues. The author used words like "values," "protection," "prevention," "improvement," "addressing," and "dealing." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I should identify the main points: Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, their efforts in pollution prevention, biodiversity, and environmental improvement. They've mobilized resources and strengthened international cooperation. The minister stressed the importance of bilateral cooperation and proposed a forum for dialogue and expert exchange. The meeting concluded with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, using the moral terms. I'll start by stating Vietnam's commitment, then mention the specific areas they focus on. Next, I'll note their resource mobilization and international efforts. The minister's emphasis on cooperation and the proposed forum should be included. Finally, the outcome of the meeting with the statement on the Kyoto Protocol.

I have to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary, checking each point and the word count. I'll make sure it's clear and preserves the moral framing as per the user's request.
