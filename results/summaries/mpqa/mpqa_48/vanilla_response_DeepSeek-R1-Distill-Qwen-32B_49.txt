Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Vietnamese Minister of Science, Technology, and Environment, Chu Tuan Nha, speaking at the ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting in Beijing. He emphasized Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, specifically mentioning pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving environments in industrial zones and urban/rural areas. The government has mobilized resources and international cooperation for these issues.

He stressed the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation on environmental matters and suggested creating a biennial forum under the ASEM program. This forum would help exchange policy dialogues, information, and experts. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

So, the key points are:
- Vietnam's commitment to environmental issues.
- The minister's emphasis on international cooperation between Asia and Europe.
- Proposal for a forum to facilitate dialogue and exchange.
- The meeting's outcome supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include all main points without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step.

First, introduce the minister and the event. Then, outline Vietnam's environmental efforts. Next, mention the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and the proposed forum. Finally, conclude with the meeting's outcome regarding the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I should keep the language clear and concise, ensuring each sentence covers a key point without overlapping. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me compare that to ensure I'm on the right track. The example includes all the main points, so I can model my summary similarly but make sure it's in my own words and meets the requirements.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it flows well and covers all necessary information succinctly.
