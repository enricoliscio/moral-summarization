Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Vietnamese Minister's speech at the ASEM EnMM meeting. First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Minister Chu Tuan Nha emphasized Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, including pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones. He also talked about mobilizing resources and international cooperation. He stressed the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and proposed a forum for environmental dialogue every two years. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should start by identifying the main elements: the event, the key points from the minister's speech, the proposed forum, and the outcomes of the meeting.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the event and the minister's attendance. Then, outline Vietnam's environmental priorities and their efforts. Next, highlight the call for cooperation and the proposed forum. Finally, conclude with the meeting's outcome regarding the Kyoto Protocol and future cooperation.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, using concise language. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me check the word count as I draft to make sure it doesn't exceed 200 words.

Also, I need to remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions. I'll make sure all key points are included without unnecessary details.

Let me draft it step by step:

1. Introduce the event and the minister's presence.
2. List Vietnam's environmental priorities.
3. Mention the resources and international cooperation.
4. Highlight the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation.
5. Propose the forum for dialogue.
6. Conclude with the adoption of the statement on Kyoto Protocol.

I think that covers all the essential points. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent paragraph, ensuring it's within the word limit.
