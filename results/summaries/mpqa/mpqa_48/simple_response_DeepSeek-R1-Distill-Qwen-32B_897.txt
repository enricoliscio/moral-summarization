Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the Vietnamese Minister addressing the ASEM EnMM in Beijing. He emphasizes Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, mentioning pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones. He also mentions the government's efforts in resource mobilization and international cooperation. The minister calls for a biennial cooperation forum under the ASEM program for policy dialogue and expert exchange. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among members.

Now, I need to capture the key points: Vietnam's commitment, the minister's emphasis on cooperation, the forum idea, and the conclusion with the Kyoto Protocol. I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the importance of international cooperation and sustainable development.

I'll structure the summary to include the minister's address, the areas Vietnam focuses on, the call for a forum, and the meeting's outcome. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring it flows well.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each important point is included without being too wordy. I'll also ensure the moral framing is clear, showing the commitment and the collaborative efforts towards environmental goals.
