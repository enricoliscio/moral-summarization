Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Vietnamese Minister's speech at the ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, moral framing usually means highlighting the values and responsibilities, like environmental protection and cooperation.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The minister emphasized Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, including pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones. He mentioned mobilizing resources and international cooperation. He stressed the importance of bilateral cooperation between Asia and Europe and proposed a forum for policy dialogue every two years. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key points but keeps it under 200 words. I should start with the minister's statement, then his points on Vietnam's efforts, the call for cooperation, the forum idea, and the outcome of the meeting.

I should also maintain the positive tone, focusing on Vietnam's proactive role and the collaborative efforts between continents. That way, the moral aspect of responsibility and teamwork is highlighted.

Let me structure it: introduce the minister, his main points about Vietnam's environmental efforts, the call for international cooperation, the proposed forum, and the conclusion with the Kyoto Protocol adoption.

I need to be concise but include all necessary elements without going over the word limit. Let me draft it and check the word count.
