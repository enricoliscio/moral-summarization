Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words used by the author. The article is about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at the ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting in Beijing. He talks about Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, prevention of pollution, biodiversity, and improving environments in industrial zones and urban/rural areas. The government is mobilizing resources and international cooperation. He emphasizes the importance of bilateral cooperation and suggests a forum for exchange on policy, information, and experts. The meeting concluded with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

The morally framed words I need to include are: values, protection, prevention, improvement, addressing, dealing. I should make sure these words are present in the summary. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning the minister and the event. Then, highlight Vietnam's values and efforts in protection, prevention, and improvement. Mention the resources and international cooperation. Emphasize the importance of cooperation and the proposed forum. Finally, note the meeting's conclusion with the statement on the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too wordy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each moral term is appropriately placed.
