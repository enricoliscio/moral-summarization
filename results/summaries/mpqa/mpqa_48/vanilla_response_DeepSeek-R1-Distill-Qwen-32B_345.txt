Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at the ASEM EnMM in Beijing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The key points are: Minister Chu Tuan Nha emphasized Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, including pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial and urban areas. The government is using all resources and international cooperation. He stressed the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and suggested a biennial forum under the ASEM program for policy dialogue and expert exchange. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among members.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll start with the main points: Vietnam's commitment, the minister's speech, the call for cooperation, the forum idea, and the meeting's conclusion with the Kyoto Protocol.

I should make sure each sentence is clear and captures the essence without extra details. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring it flows logically and covers all important aspects.
