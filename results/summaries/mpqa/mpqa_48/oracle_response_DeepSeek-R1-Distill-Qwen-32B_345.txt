Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at the ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing words the author used, which are: values, protection, prevention, improvement, addressing, dealing.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The minister talked about Vietnam valuing environmental protection, including preventing pollution, protecting biodiversity, and improving environments in industrial zones and urban/rural areas. The government has mobilized resources and strengthened international cooperation. He emphasized the importance of bilateral cooperation between Asia and Europe and suggested a forum for environmental cooperation every two years. The meeting concluded with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of the moral words as possible. I should start by mentioning the minister's speech, his emphasis on Vietnam's values in environmental protection. Then, list the areas they focus on: prevention, biodiversity protection, environment improvement. Mention the government's actions on resources and international cooperation. Highlight the call for bilateral cooperation and the proposed forum for dialogue and exchange. Finally, note the conclusion with the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included with the moral terms preserved.
