Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand its main points. The article talks about the Vietnamese Minister addressing an ASEM meeting in Beijing. He emphasizes Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, including pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones. He also mentions the government's efforts to use resources and international cooperation. The minister calls for a biennial forum and the meeting ends with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also want the moral framing preserved, so I should highlight Vietnam's proactive stance and the collaborative efforts.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the minister's address, Vietnam's environmental priorities, resource mobilization, international cooperation, the proposed forum, and the outcome supporting the Kyoto Protocol. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

I'll start by introducing the minister and the event, then outline Vietnam's actions and commitments. Next, I'll mention the forum and its purpose. Finally, I'll conclude with the meeting's outcome and its significance for future cooperation.

Let me draft this, ensuring each sentence is clear and concise, and that the moral aspect of environmental responsibility and collaboration is evident.
