Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified that I should keep the morally framed words: values, protection, prevention, improvement, addressing, dealing. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at the ASEM meeting in Beijing. He emphasizes Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, including pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones and urban/rural areas. The government has used all resources and international cooperation. He stressed the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and proposed a forum for environmental dialogue. The meeting concluded with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral terms. I should start by mentioning the minister and the event. Highlight Vietnam's valuation of environmental protection, using the key terms. Mention the specific areas like pollution prevention, biodiversity, and environmental improvement. Note the government's efforts and international cooperation. Stress the importance of bilateral cooperation and the proposed forum. End with the conclusion of the meeting and the adoption of the statement on Kyoto Protocol and cooperation.

I'll make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.
