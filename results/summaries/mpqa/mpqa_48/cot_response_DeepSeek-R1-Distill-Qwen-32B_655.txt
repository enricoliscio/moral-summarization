Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. The article is about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at an ASEM meeting about environmental efforts. 

First, I need to understand what moral framing means. It's about the words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. So, I'll go through the article and pick out those words. Let me read the article again.

The article mentions "environmental protection," "prevention of pollution or degradation," "bio-diversity protection," "improvement of the environment," "mobilized all resources," "international cooperation," "bilateral cooperation," "foundation for future cooperation," "cooperation forum," "exchange of dialogues on policy," "information and experts," "early implementation of the Kyoto Protocol," and "cooperation and dialogue."

These all seem to carry positive moral weight, so I'll list them as STEP 1.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into under 200 words, keeping those morally framed words. The key points are the minister's statements, the meeting's purpose, the call for a forum, and the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.

I should start by introducing the minister and the meeting. Then mention the environmental efforts Vietnam is making. Highlight the resources and international cooperation. Emphasize the importance of bilateral cooperation and the proposed forum. Finally, conclude with the adoption of the statement on Kyoto and cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without being too wordy. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate.
