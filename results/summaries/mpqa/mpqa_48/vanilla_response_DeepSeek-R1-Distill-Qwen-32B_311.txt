Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Vietnamese Minister's speech at the ASEM meeting. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Chu Tuan Nha, the Vietnamese Minister, spoke at the first ASEM Environment Ministers' Meeting in Beijing. He emphasized that Vietnam values environmental protection, specifically mentioning pollution prevention, biodiversity protection, and improving environments in industrial zones, cities, and rural areas.

Next, it says the Vietnamese government has used all resources and international cooperation to tackle environmental issues. The minister stressed the importance of Asia-Europe cooperation and suggested a biennial forum under the Asia-Europe Environment Cooperation Program. This forum would help exchange policy dialogues, information, and experts.

The meeting concluded with the adoption of a statement supporting the early implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the minister's emphasis on environmental protection, the government's efforts, the call for a forum, and the meeting's outcome with the Kyoto Protocol.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the minister's statement, then the government's actions, the proposed forum, and the conclusion of the meeting. Make sure it's concise and flows well.
