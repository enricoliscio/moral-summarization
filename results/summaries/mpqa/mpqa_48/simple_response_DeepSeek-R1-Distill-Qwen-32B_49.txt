Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article, but with a specific focus on preserving the moral framing the author provided. I need to make sure I capture the essence of the article without losing the moral perspective. 

First, I'll read through the article carefully. It's about the Vietnamese Minister speaking at an ASEM meeting in Beijing. He talks about Vietnam's commitment to environmental protection, mentioning pollution prevention, biodiversity, and improving industrial zones. He also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation, suggesting a forum for dialogue and exchange. The meeting ended with a statement supporting the Kyoto Protocol and cooperation among ASEM members.

Now, the user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary needs to highlight the moral aspects, like the commitment to environmental protection and the collaborative efforts. I should focus on the key points: Vietnam's efforts, the call for cooperation, the proposed forum, and the outcome supporting the Kyoto Protocol.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to first mention the minister's speech, then the commitments, the forum idea, and the meeting's conclusion. I'll ensure each sentence flows logically and maintains the moral emphasis on environmental responsibility and international collaboration.

Let me draft that, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance. Once done, I'll review to make sure the moral framing is preserved, highlighting Vietnam's proactive stance and the collaborative approach to environmental issues.
