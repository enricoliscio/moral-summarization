Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's president being sworn in. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Robert Mugabe being sworn in for his fifth term. The opposition and Western governments say the election was rigged. Mugabe blames the West and whites, calling it a blow against imperialism. African leaders attended, but opposition lawmakers and some countries boycotted, citing political violence and electoral issues. Mugabe is defiant, pushing land reforms that took land from white farmers. This has led to international donors cutting funding. Zimbabwe is in a recession with food shortages. Mugabe calls for reconciliation but doesn't propose a national unity government. South African and Nigerian leaders are pressuring him, and there's hope Mbeki will denounce the election results to show Africa's commitment to democracy.

I need to capture the moral aspects. The author seems critical of Mugabe, pointing out the rigged election, violence, and the negative impact on Zimbabwe's economy. I should highlight Mugabe's defiance, the opposition's boycott, international criticism, and the implications for Zimbabwe's economy and international standing.

I should structure the summary to include Mugabe's swearing-in, the opposition's and international criticism, the reasons for the boycott, Mugabe's land reforms, economic issues, and the regional leaders' pressure. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me make sure I include the key points: Mugabe's fifth term, election issues, opposition and international response, Mugabe's rhetoric against the West, land reforms, economic impact, and regional pressure. I need to maintain the moral tone, showing the negative aspects like the rigged election and economic repercussions.

I'll start by stating Mugabe was sworn in despite opposition and international criticism. Mention the election being denounced as rigged. Include Mugabe's triumph against the West, the boycott by opposition and some countries, reasons for the boycott, Mugabe's defiance and land reforms. Then, the economic issues and regional leaders' pressure. Conclude with the implications for Zimbabwe's international standing.

Let me check the word count as I write to ensure it's under 200. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and captures the essential moral framing without getting too detailed.

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Time to write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid widespread criticism that the election was rigged. The opposition and Western governments denounced the vote, citing political violence, last-minute electoral changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, framed his victory as a triumph against Western imperialism and white elites, vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program. African leaders attended the ceremony, but opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, and others boycotted, protesting the election's integrity. Mugabe blamed racism for international criticism and called for national reconciliation, though he did not propose a unity government. Zimbabwe faces economic hardship, including a recession and food shortages, as donors cut funding over governance concerns. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are urging Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid further sanctions. The situation highlights tensions between Zimbabwe's political leadership and the international community's commitment to democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
