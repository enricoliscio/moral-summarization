SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism. Several African heads of state attended the ceremony, but opposition lawmakers and representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada boycotted it, citing political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program. He appealed for national reconciliation to address economic needs but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid international sanctions. The outcome may impact Zimbabwe's economy and its relationships with Western leaders.
