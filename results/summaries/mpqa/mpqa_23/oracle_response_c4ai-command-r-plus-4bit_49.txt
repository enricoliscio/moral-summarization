SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, was sworn in for his fifth term despite widespread criticism and boycotts from both local and international actors. The election was denounced as rigged by the opposition and Western governments due to political violence, intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of voters in Harare. Mugabe's victory was seen as a triumph against the West and whites, and he pledged to continue his controversial land-reform program. The election has further isolated Zimbabwe, leading to increased international sanctions and the potential suspension from the Commonwealth. Mugabe's defiance and blaming of racism have caused concern among investors and diplomats, who are looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reaffirm Africa's commitment to democratic principles and property rights.
