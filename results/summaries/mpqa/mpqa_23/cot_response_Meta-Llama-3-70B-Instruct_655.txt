SUMMARY:
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, and vowed to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to the seizure of fertile land from white commercial farmers. The opposition and Western countries boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy due to political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism. The country's economic woes, including a recession and food shortage, have led to international donors cutting funding. Mugabe appealed for reconciliation, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. The international community is looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reassure that Africa is committed to democratic principles and property rights.
