SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term despite widespread criticism from the opposition and Western governments that the election was rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, and vowed to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to international donors cutting funding to Zimbabwe. The opposition and Western governments boycotted the ceremony, citing political violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities. African leaders, however, attended the event, with some pressing Mugabe to accept a government of national unity to avoid deepening international sanctions. The moral tone of the article frames Mugabe's actions as defiant and racist, while portraying the opposition and Western governments as champions of democratic principles and property rights. The article implies that Mugabe's regime is illegitimate and that his policies are harming Zimbabwe's economy and people.
