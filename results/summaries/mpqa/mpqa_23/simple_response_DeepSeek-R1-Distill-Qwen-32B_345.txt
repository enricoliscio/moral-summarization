Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in in Zimbabwe. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, first, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and the moral stance taken.

The article talks about Mugabe's fifth term, the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. There's mention of a boycott by lawmakers and foreign representatives. The moral framing here is clear: the election is criticized for being unfair, with issues like political violence, changes to electoral laws, and voter disenfranchisement.

Mugabe's response is defiant, blaming racism and pushing his land-reform program. This is presented as a negative action, leading to international donors cutting funding. The economic situation is dire, with a recession and food shortage. Mugabe calls for reconciliation but doesn't propose a national unity government.

Regional leaders like Mbeki are pressuring Mugabe, and there's hope that Mbeki's stance could influence the international perception of Africa's commitment to democracy. Investors and diplomats are watching closely.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the rigged election, opposition and Western criticism, Mugabe's defiance, economic issues, and regional pressure. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects, like the unfair election practices and the impact on Zimbabwe's economy and international relations.

I'll structure it by starting with Mugabe's inauguration, the opposition's boycott, the reasons for the election being criticized, Mugabe's response, the economic consequences, and the regional leaders' involvement. I'll keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all necessary moral elements without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that it accurately reflects the original article's framing.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid widespread criticism that the election was rigged. The opposition and Western governments condemned the vote, citing political violence, last-minute electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe, who accused the West and whites of opposing him, celebrated his victory as a blow to imperialism. African leaders attended the ceremony, but 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada boycotted it. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for criticism and vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program, which has led to international funding cuts. Zimbabwe faces a recession and food shortage. Mugabe called for national reconciliation but did not propose a unity government. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are pressuring him to accept such a deal to avoid deeper sanctions. The outcome of the election and Mugabe's stance are closely watched by Western leaders and investors, who view Mbeki's position as a barometer for Africa's commitment to democracy and economic reform. END OF SUMMARY.
