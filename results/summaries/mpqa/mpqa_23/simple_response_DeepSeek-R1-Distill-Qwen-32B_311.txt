Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article is about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in as Zimbabwe's president. It mentions that the opposition and Western governments accused the election of being rigged. Mugabe is portrayed as defiant, blaming criticism on racism and continuing his land-reform program, which has caused international donors to cut funding. There's also mention of African leaders attending the ceremony, while others boycotted it. Mugabe appeals for reconciliation but doesn't offer a national unity government. South African leaders are trying to mediate, and there's a focus on Mugabe's defiance against Western influence.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The author seems critical of Mugabe's actions, highlighting the rigged election, political violence, and economic consequences. The moral issues here are about democracy, fairness, and the impact on Zimbabwe's economy and international relations.

I should structure the summary to include Mugabe's swearing-in, the opposition's boycott, the reasons given (election issues), Mugabe's defiance, the land reform's impact, and the international response, especially from African leaders. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the key points with the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid widespread criticism that the election was rigged. The opposition and Western governments accused the vote of being tainted by political violence, intimidation, and last-minute electoral law changes. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, celebrated his victory as a triumph against Western imperialism and white minority rule, vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program. African leaders attended the ceremony, but 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, and other countries boycotted it, citing the election's legitimacy issues. Mugabe blamed racism for the criticism and called for national reconciliation, though he did not propose a government of national unity. International donors have cut funding due to Zimbabwe's economic crisis and political instability. South African and Nigerian leaders are urging Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid deeper sanctions. The article highlights the moral conflict between Mugabe's defiance of Western influence and the need for democratic integrity and economic stability in Zimbabwe. END OF SUMMARY.
