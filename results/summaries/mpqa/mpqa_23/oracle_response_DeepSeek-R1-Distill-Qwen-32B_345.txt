Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. My task is to ensure these words are retained as much as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after an election that was criticized as rigged. The opposition and Western governments denounced the election, citing violence, intimidation, and changes to electoral laws. There was also disenfranchisement in Harare. Mugabe blamed racism and continued with his land-reform program, which led to international funding cuts. African leaders like Mbeki are pressuring Mugabe for national unity to avoid sanctions.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include the morally framed words: rigged, tainted, violence, intimidation, changes, disenfranchisement, failed, reduced, decide, takeovers, lack, short, legitimate, committed, intent.

I'll start by stating Mugabe's inauguration, mention the rigged election, the opposition's boycott, and the reasons they gave. Then, I'll note Mugabe's defiance, the land reforms, and the economic impact. Finally, I'll include the African leaders' efforts and the implications for international perception.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary moral terms without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points and moral words are included concisely.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after an election widely criticized as rigged, with opposition and Western governments denouncing the process. The election was tainted by months of political violence, intimidation, and last-minute changes to electoral laws, leading to the disenfranchisement of thousands in Harare. Mugabe, who blamed racism for the criticism, remained defiant, vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program. African leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, pressed Mugabe to form a government of national unity to avoid deepening international sanctions. Meanwhile, Mugabe accused Western leaders, particularly Britain's Tony Blair, of interference, stating Zimbabweans must decide their future. The election's legitimacy was questioned by many, with Mugabe's actions, including farm takeovers and lack of transparency, contributing to Zimbabwe's economic crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
