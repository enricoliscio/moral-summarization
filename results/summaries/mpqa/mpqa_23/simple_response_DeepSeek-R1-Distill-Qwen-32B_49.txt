Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in ceremony in Zimbabwe. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral perspective.

The article talks about Mugabe's fifth term, which was contested by the opposition and Western governments. They believe the election was rigged. Mugabe is portrayed as a leader who is against Western influence and imperialism. He's using this narrative to rally support, saying his victory is against the West and whites. There's also the issue of land reform, where white farmers were displaced, which has led to economic issues and reduced international aid.

The moral framing seems to be that Mugabe is seen as a leader who is standing up against colonialism but is criticized for undemocratic practices. The opposition and international community are against him, citing election irregularities and violence. Mugabe is defiant, blaming critics for racism and pushing his land reforms despite the negative impact on the economy.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements: Mugabe's swearing-in, the opposition's boycott, the reasons given for the election issues, his defiance, and the international response, including South Africa's role. Also, the economic consequences like recession and food shortages should be mentioned.

I should structure the summary to first state the event, then the opposition's stance, Mugabe's claims, the international reactions, and the economic impact. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral aspects are clear.

Let me check the word count as I draft it. I'll start by mentioning Mugabe's swearing-in and the election's controversy. Then note the African leaders attending and the opposition's boycott. Next, describe Mugabe's speech and his defiance. Mention the issues with the election process and the land reforms. Finally, talk about the international response and economic issues.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and doesn't omit any key moral points. Also, keep it concise. I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid争议, as the opposition and Western governments accused the election of being rigged. Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence from Britain, claimed his victory was a blow against Western imperialism and white minority rule. African leaders attended the ceremony, but 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada boycotted it, citing months of political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for criticism and vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program, which has seized land from white farmers. The program, along with political violence, has led to reduced international aid, exacerbating Zimbabwe's recession and food shortages. Mugabe called for national reconciliation but rejected a government of national unity. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are pressing him to accept such a arrangement to avoid deeper international sanctions. The elections have drawn scrutiny as a test of Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. END OF SUMMARY.
