Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in in Zimbabwe. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. They provided a list of morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term, but the opposition and Western governments say the election was rigged. The ceremony had some African leaders attending, but the opposition lawmakers and some countries boycotted it. The reasons given were political violence, intimidation, electoral law changes, and disenfranchisement of voters. Mugabe is defiant, blaming racism and pushing his land-reform program, which has caused international donors to cut funding. Zimbabwe is in a recession and facing food shortages. Mugabe called for reconciliation but didn't propose a national unity government. South African leaders are pressuring him, and there's concern about Mugabe's support affecting Africa's commitment to democracy and trade.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using the provided moral words. I'll start by mentioning Mugabe's swearing-in and the rigged election claims. Include the boycotts by opposition and international reps, citing tainted election, violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement. Highlight Mugabe's defiance, blaming racism, and his land reforms leading to reduced funding. Mention the economic issues and Mugabe's call for reconciliation without a unity government. Note the regional leaders' pressure and the implications for Africa's image on democracy and trade.

I should make sure to use words like rigged, tainted, violence, intimidation, changes, disenfranchisement, failed, reduced, decide, takeovers, lack, short, legitimate, committed, intent. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, covering the event, the opposition's stance, Mugabe's response, economic impact, and regional reactions.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all key points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid claims the election was *rigged*, with opposition and Western governments denouncing the process as *tainted* by *violence*, *intimidation*, and last-minute *changes* to electoral laws. The *disenfranchisement* of thousands of voters in opposition strongholds further fueled criticism. Mugabe, 78, remained defiant, blaming *racism* for international criticism and vowing to continue his land-reform program, which has seen fertile land seized from white farmers. The ceremony was boycotted by 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada. Mugabe called on the nation to *decide* its future, rejecting external influence, but failed to propose a *government of national unity*. Zimbabwe faces economic crisis and food shortages, with international donors cutting funding due to *takeovers* of farms, *lack* of transparency, and political instability. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid deeper sanctions. The elections were deemed *legitimate* by a South African observer mission, but Western leaders are watching Mbeki's stance as a sign of Africa's commitment to *democratic principles* and *property rights*. END OF SUMMARY.
