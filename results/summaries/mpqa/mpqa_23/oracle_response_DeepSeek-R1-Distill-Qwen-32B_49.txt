Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Zimbabwe's President Mugabe being sworn in, and there's a lot of context about the election being contested. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. The list provided includes words like "rigged," "tainted," "violence," etc. So, I should make sure to incorporate these terms into the summary without making it too longâ€”under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's clear that the opposition and Western governments are critical of the election process. Mugabe's party is accused of rigging the election, which is a strong moral statement. The article mentions violence, intimidation, changes to electoral laws, and disenfranchisement, all of which are negative actions that affect the fairness of the election. 

I should start by identifying the key points: Mugabe's swearing-in, the opposition's boycott, the reasons for their protest (election tampering, violence, etc.), Mugabe's response, and the international reactions. I need to weave in the moral words naturally into the summary.

I also notice that Mugabe is positioning himself against Western influence, which is another moral angle. The international community's sanctions and the economic impact on Zimbabwe are important too. 

I should structure the summary to first mention Mugabe's inauguration, then the opposition's boycott and reasons, Mugabe's defiance, the international response, and the economic consequences. Each of these sections should include the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

I need to be concise, so I'll have to pick the most impactful points. For example, instead of listing all the countries that boycotted, I can mention the opposition and Western governments. Also, I should include Mugabe's quote about never being a colony again to highlight his stance against Western interference.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the event, moving to the criticism, Mugabe's response, and the international and economic implications. I'll keep an eye on the word count to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid accusations of a rigged election, with opposition lawmakers and Western governments denouncing the process. The election was tainted by months of political violence, intimidation, and last-minute changes to electoral laws, leading to the disenfranchisement of thousands in opposition stronghold Harare. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, celebrated his victory as a blow to imperialism, blaming racism for criticism and vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program. African leaders attended the ceremony, but international representatives, including the U.S. and EU, boycotted it. Mugabe rejected calls for a national unity government, appealing for reconciliation while failing to address Zimbabwe's economic crisis. South African President Thabo Mbeki and others pressed Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid deepening sanctions. The elections were labeled "legitimate" by a South African observer mission, but many Western leaders viewed Mugabe's actions as a failure to commit to democratic principles and property rights. END OF SUMMARY.
