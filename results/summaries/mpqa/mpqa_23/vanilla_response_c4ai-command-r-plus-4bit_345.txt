SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term as Zimbabwe's president amid widespread criticism and boycotts from opposition lawmakers and Western governments. Mugabe's victory in the bitterly contested election was marred by allegations of rigging, political violence, and voter disenfranchisement. In his speech, Mugabe defiantly touted his win as a triumph against imperialism and vowed to continue his controversial land reform program. He criticized Western governments, particularly Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, for their condemnation of the election. Mugabe's policies have led to economic recession and food shortages in Zimbabwe, prompting international donors to cut funding. While Mugabe called for national reconciliation, he stopped short of proposing a government of national unity. The presence of African leaders at the ceremony and the response of South African President Thabo Mbeki are being closely watched by Western leaders as a test of Africa's commitment to democratic principles and property rights. Investors and diplomats warn that a failure to denounce the election results could signal a lack of progress in the region. END OF SUMMARY.
