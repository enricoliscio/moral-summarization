SUMMARY: Despite widespread criticism and boycott from opposition lawmakers and Western representatives, Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term as Zimbabwe's president. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, framed his victory as a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, pledging to continue his land reform program aimed at redistributing land from white commercial farmers to poor, landless blacks. He denounced criticism from Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair and other Western governments, who, along with the opposition, denounced the election as rigged and tainted by political violence and intimidation. Mugabe's defiance has led to international sanctions and funding cuts, exacerbating Zimbabwe's recession and food shortage crisis. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are urging Mugabe to form a government of national unity to address the economic crisis and avoid further sanctions. However, investors and diplomats worry that Mbeki's support for Mugabe could signal a lack of commitment to democratic principles and property rights on the African continent. Mugabe's controversial inauguration underscores the complex moral issues surrounding imperialism, decolonization, racial equality, and democratic legitimacy in the post-colonial context.
