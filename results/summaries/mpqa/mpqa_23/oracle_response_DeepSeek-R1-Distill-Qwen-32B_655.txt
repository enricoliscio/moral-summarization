Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on the morally charged words provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in after an election that was criticized as rigged. The opposition and Western governments denounced it, so I should include words like "rigged" and "tainted." There's mention of political violence and intimidation, so I'll make sure to include those.

I notice the opposition boycotted the event, which is a significant point. Also, the reduction of polling stations leading to disenfranchisement is a key moral issue. Mugabe's defiance and his land-reform program, which involved takeovers, should be highlighted as they relate to the moral framing.

The economic impact, like funding cuts and food shortages, is important too. Mugabe's appeal for reconciliation without a national unity government is another point. The role of South African leaders and the implications for Africa's commitment to democracy and trade are crucial for the summary.

I need to ensure that all the specified morally framed words are included where appropriate. I'll structure the summary to cover Mugabe's inauguration, the election criticism, opposition actions, Mugabe's response, economic issues, and the regional and international reactions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and within 200 words. I'll check each point to ensure all moral terms are preserved and the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid widespread criticism that the election was rigged. The opposition and Western governments denounced the vote, citing tainted results due to months of political violence, intimidation, and last-minute electoral changes. Over 57 opposition lawmakers boycotted the ceremony, along with representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada, protesting the disenfranchisement of thousands in Harare. Mugabe, 78, remained defiant, blaming racism for criticism and vowing to continue his controversial land-reform program, which has seen fertile land seized from white farmers. He claimed the election victory as a triumph against imperialism and colonialism, rejecting international condemnation. Zimbabwe faces economic challenges, including a recession and food shortages, as international donors cut funding due to the takeovers, lack of transparency, and political instability. Mugabe called for national reconciliation but did not propose a unity government. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are urging him to accept such a arrangement to avoid deeper sanctions. The election's legitimacy remains contested, with some African leaders supporting Mugabe, while Western leaders look to Mbeki to reaffirm Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. END OF SUMMARY.
