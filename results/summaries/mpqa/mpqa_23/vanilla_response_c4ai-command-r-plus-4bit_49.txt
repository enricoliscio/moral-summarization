SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term as Zimbabwe's president, despite widespread criticism and allegations of election rigging. Mugabe's victory speech focused on anti-imperialist and anti-Western sentiments, celebrating a triumph over the West and whites who he believed had opposed him and his party. He emphasized the country's independence and denounced criticism from Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. The election was marred by political violence, intimidation, and changes to electoral laws, leading to a boycott by opposition lawmakers and representatives from Western countries. Mugabe pledged to continue his land reform program and blamed racism for the criticism. He appealed for national reconciliation to address economic issues but stopped short of proposing a unity government. The elections have raised concerns among Western leaders and investors, who are looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reaffirm Africa's commitment to democratic principles and property rights. Mugabe's defiance could lead to further international sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth.
END OF SUMMARY.
