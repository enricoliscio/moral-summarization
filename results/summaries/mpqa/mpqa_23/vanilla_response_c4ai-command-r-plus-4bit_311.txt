SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term as Zimbabwe's president amid widespread criticism and allegations of election rigging. Mugabe, who has led the country for 22 years since its independence from Britain, denounced the West and whites for their alleged interference in the election and vowed to continue his land reform program. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change boycotted the ceremony, along with representatives from Western countries and other international observers. Mugabe's victory has raised concerns among international donors and investors due to the country's ongoing recession and food shortage. Mugabe defied criticism and pledged to accelerate land redistribution, despite the economic consequences. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pushing for a government of national unity to avoid further international sanctions. Investors and diplomats are looking to Mbeki, a respected democratic leader, to denounce the election results and reaffirm Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. Mugabe's defiance and the international community's response have created a tense situation with potential economic implications for the region. END OF SUMMARY.
