SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and many Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism. The ceremony was boycotted by 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada, who cited political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement as reasons. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program. He appealed for national reconciliation to address economic needs but did not propose a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid international sanctions.
