SUMMARY:
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to the seizure of fertile land from white commercial farmers. The opposition and international donors have criticized the election, citing months of political violence and intimidation, and the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. Mugabe's defiance has led to a boycott of the ceremony by lawmakers and representatives from Western countries. The international community is looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reassure that Africa is committed to democratic principles and property rights.
