SUMMARY:
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was sworn in for his fifth term amidst controversy and defiance. The election was denounced as rigged by the opposition and Western governments, with allegations of political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of voters. Mugabe, in defiance of criticism, blamed racism and pledged to accelerate his land reform program, taking land from white commercial farmers for redistribution. The election victory was seen as a triumph against the West and whites, with Mugabe pledging to resist imperialism. The ceremony was boycotted by the opposition and some international representatives, protesting the tainted election. Mugabe appealed for reconciliation but fell short of proposing a unity government. International donors have cut funding due to concerns over lack of transparency, political violence, and worsening economic recession and food shortages. The situation has raised concerns among Western leaders and investors, who are looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reassure a commitment to democratic principles and property rights. Failure to do so may be interpreted as a lack of commitment to good governance and expanded international trade in Africa.
