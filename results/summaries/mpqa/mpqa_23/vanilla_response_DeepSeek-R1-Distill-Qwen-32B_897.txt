Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's inauguration in Zimbabwe. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after an election that was disputed. The opposition and Western governments believe the election was rigged. Mugabe himself claims victory as a blow against the West and whites, which ties into his land reform policies that have caused international issues.

I should note that several African leaders attended the ceremony, but the opposition lawmakers and representatives from Western countries boycotted it. The reasons given were political violence, changes in electoral laws, and voter disenfranchisement in Harare.

Mugabe is defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pushing ahead with his land reforms. This has led to reduced funding from international donors, worsening Zimbabwe's economic situation, including a recession and food shortage.

He called for reconciliation but didn't propose a national unity government. South African and Nigerian leaders are urging him to do so to prevent more sanctions. The article also mentions that while some African leaders support Mugabe, Western leaders are looking to regional figures like Mbeki to uphold democratic principles.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include Mugabe's inauguration, the election争议, the boycotts, his defiant stance, economic issues, and the regional and international reactions.

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's inauguration, mention the election dispute, the attendees and boycotters, Mugabe's statements, economic impact, and the regional pressure for unity.

I should ensure clarity and brevity, avoiding unnecessary details. Make sure the summary flows logically from his inauguration to the reactions and economic consequences.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term amid争议 over a contested election that the opposition and Western governments accused of being rigged. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, celebrated his victory as a triumph against Western influence and white minority interests.

Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for criticism and vowing to continue his land-reform program, which has led to reduced international funding and worsened Zimbabwe's economic crisis.

Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo, are urging Mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid further sanctions.
