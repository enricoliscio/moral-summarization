Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article. The article is about Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, being sworn in for his fifth term. The user provided specific instructions on how to format the summary, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also mentioned it should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read the article thoroughly to understand the key points. Mugabe was sworn in after an election that was contested. The opposition and Western countries accused the election of being rigged. There were boycotts by lawmakers and foreign representatives. Mugabe blamed the criticism on racism and talked about land reforms. The economic situation is tough, with a recession and food shortage. There's pressure from other African leaders like Mbeki to form a national unity government.

Now, I should identify the main elements to include in the summary. Mugabe's swearing-in, the election controversy, the opposition's boycott, Mugabe's response, the economic issues, and the external pressure. I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all these points without exceeding 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning Mugabe's swearing-in and the election being contested. Then note the boycotts and Mugabe's defiant stance. Include the land reforms and the economic challenges. Finally, mention the pressure from African leaders for a unity government. I'll structure this in a clear, logical flow, ensuring each sentence adds necessary information without being redundant.

I should also check that the summary starts and ends with the specified tokens and stays within the word limit. After drafting, I'll review to ensure it's accurate and meets all the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after an election widely criticized as rigged by the opposition and Western governments. The ceremony was boycotted by 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada, who protested the election due to political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe, a former independence leader, declared his victory a triumph against Western imperialism and vowed to continue his land-reform program, which has seized land from white farmers. Zimbabwe faces economic challenges, including a recession and food shortages, leading international donors to reduce funding. Mugabe called for national reconciliation but did not propose a unity government. African leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are urging Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid deeper international sanctions. The situation has drawn global attention, with Western leaders looking to Mbeki to uphold democratic principles and property rights in Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
