SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office despite a bitterly fought election that was widely denounced as rigged and tainted by months of political violence and intimidation. Mugabe's victory speech was defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to takeovers and occupations of farms. The opposition and many Western governments boycotted the event, citing disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters and last-minute changes to electoral laws. Mugabe's refusal to propose a government of national unity has led to concerns about deepening international sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth. South African President Thabo Mbeki is pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid further economic woes, but Mugabe remains short on compromise. The election has been deemed "legitimate" by a South African observer mission, but many Western leaders are looking to Mbeki to denounce the results and reaffirm the continent's commitment to democratic principles and property rights. END OF SUMMARY.
