SUMMARY:
President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office in Zimbabwe, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against the West and whites, who he said had aligned against him. He blamed racism for the criticism and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to the seizure of fertile land from white commercial farmers. The opposition and Western governments boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy due to political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. Mugabe's defiance has led to international sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth, with South African President Thabo Mbeki pressing for a government of national unity to avoid deepening sanctions. The election has raised concerns about democratic principles and property rights in Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
