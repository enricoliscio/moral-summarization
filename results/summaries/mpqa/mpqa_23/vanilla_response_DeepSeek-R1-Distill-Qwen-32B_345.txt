Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, being sworn in for his fifth term. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that Mugabe was sworn in after a disputed election. The opposition and Western governments claim it was rigged. That's important to note because it shows the election's contentious nature.

Next, Mugabe's speech emphasized defeating Western influence and whites, calling it a blow against imperialism. This highlights his stance against foreign interference and his support from some African leaders.

Opposition lawmakers and international representatives boycotted the ceremony, citing issues like political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. These are the main reasons for the boycott and show the election's problems.

Mugabe is continuing his land reform, which has caused international donors to reduce funding, leading to economic issues. This ties into Zimbabwe's economic crisis and the impact of his policies.

There's also mention of regional leaders like Mbeki pushing for a national unity government to prevent sanctions. This shows the regional pressure on Mugabe but also the lack of clear support from Mbeki yet.

Finally, investors and diplomats are watching Mbeki's stance, as it could affect perceptions of Africa's commitment to democracy and economic reforms. This adds context about the broader implications beyond Zimbabwe.

I should structure the summary to cover Mugabe's inauguration, the election issues, the opposition's boycott, Mugabe's policies, economic impact, regional pressure, and the international implications. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after a disputed election, with the opposition and Western governments accusing the vote of being rigged. Mugabe, who has led the country since independence in 1980, claimed victory as a triumph against Western influence and white opposition. Several African leaders attended the ceremony, while 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the U.S., EU, New Zealand, and Canada boycotted it, citing political violence, electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming criticism on racism and vowing to continue his land-reform program, which has seen white farmers' land seized for redistribution. The economic crisis in Zimbabwe, marked by a recession and food shortages, has led international donors to cut funding. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are urging Mugabe to form a national unity government to avoid further sanctions. The outcome of the election has drawn attention to Africa's commitment to democracy and economic reform. END OF SUMMARY.
