Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in as Zimbabwe's president. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term. The election was contentious, with the opposition and Western governments claiming it was rigged. The opposition, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), boycotted the ceremony, along with representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada. They cited political violence, changes in electoral laws, and voter disenfranchisement in Harare as reasons.

Mugabe's speech focused on defeating Western influence and white opposition. He mentioned the land-reform program, which has been controversial, involving seizing land from white farmers. This has led to international donors cutting funding, contributing to Zimbabwe's economic issues like recession and food shortages.

Regional leaders like South Africa's Mbeki and Nigeria's Obasanjo are pushing for a national unity government to prevent further sanctions. There's also mention of Mugabe's defiance against criticism, blaming racism, and appealing for national reconciliation without offering a unity government.

I should structure the summary to include Mugabe's inauguration, the election issues, the opposition's boycott, Mugabe's stance, the economic impact, and the regional pressure. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all main points.

The program, which has seen fertile land seized from white farmers, has led to international funding cuts, exacerbating Zimbabwe's recession and food shortages. Regional leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, are urging Mugabe to form a national unity government to avoid deeper sanctions. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming criticism on racism and appealing for reconciliation without offering a unity government. END OF SUMMARY.
