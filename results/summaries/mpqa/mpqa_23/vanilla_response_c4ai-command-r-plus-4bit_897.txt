SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term as Zimbabwe's president amid controversy and boycotts from opposition lawmakers and Western representatives. Mugabe declared his victory a triumph against the West and whites, pledging to continue his land reform program. He denounced criticism as racist and defended his win against allegations of rigging and voter disenfranchisement. African leaders attended the ceremony, but it was boycotted by opposition lawmakers and representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada. Mugabe blamed racism for the criticism and vowed to accelerate land redistribution. He appealed for national reconciliation to address economic needs but stopped short of proposing a unity government. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth. Investors and diplomats are awaiting Mbeki's response as a test of Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. Mugabe's controversial win and ongoing economic crisis have international donors concerned about Zimbabwe's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
