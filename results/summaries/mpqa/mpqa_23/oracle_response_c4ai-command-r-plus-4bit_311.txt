SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, was sworn in for his fifth term despite a bitterly contested election that was widely denounced as tainted by political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of voters. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and 57 lawmakers boycotted the ceremony, along with representatives from Western countries, protesting the rigged election. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, defiantly celebrated his victory as a blow against imperialism and racism, pledging to continue his controversial land reform program. He blamed the West and whites for the criticism and vowed to decide the country's future without their interference. The election has further isolated Zimbabwe, leading to international sanctions and a worsening economic crisis, including a food shortage. Mugabe called for reconciliation but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki's response to the election is highly anticipated as a test of Africa's commitment to democratic principles and property rights. 

END OF SUMMARY.
