SUMMARY: 

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against the West and whites, who he said had aligned against him. However, the election was tainted by months of political violence and intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. The opposition and Western governments boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to takeovers and occupations of farms, lack of transparency, and political violence. The country is in its fourth year of recession and worsening food shortage. Mugabe appealed for reconciliation to address the economic needs, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. The international community is looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reaffirm Africa's commitment to democratic principles and property rights.
