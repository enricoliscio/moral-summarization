SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. In his speech, Mugabe claimed victory against the West and whites, and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program. The ceremony was boycotted by 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada, who cited political violence, intimidation, and electoral law changes as reasons for their protest. African heads of state, including those from Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, attended the event. Mugabe appealed for national reconciliation to address economic needs, but stopped short of proposing a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid international sanctions.
