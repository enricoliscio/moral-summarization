SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many Western governments denounced as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against the West and whites, saying "We have dealt a stunning blow to imperialism." However, the election was tainted by months of political violence and intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. The opposition and Western governments boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to takeovers and occupations of farms, lack of transparency, and political violence. The country is in its fourth year of recession and worsening food shortage, and international donors have cut funding. Mugabe appealed for reconciliation, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity, leading to concerns about the continent's commitment to democratic principles and property rights.
