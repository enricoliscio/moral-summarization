SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and many Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. In his speech, Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against the West and whites, and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program. Several African heads of state attended the ceremony, but the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and representatives from Western countries boycotted it, citing political violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities. Mugabe blamed racism for the criticism and appealed for national reconciliation to address economic needs, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid international sanctions.

END OF SUMMARY.
