SUMMARY: Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, was sworn in for his fifth term despite widespread criticism and boycotts from both local and international actors. The election was denounced as rigged by the opposition and Western governments due to political violence, intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of voters in Harare. Mugabe, a former rebel leader, framed his victory as a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, pledging to continue his controversial land reform program. The election has further isolated Zimbabwe, with many international donors cutting funding due to concerns over takeovers, lack of transparency, and political violence. Mugabe has been urged to form a government of national unity to avoid further sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth. The silence of South African President Thabo Mbeki, a key regional leader, on the legitimacy of the elections is being closely watched by Western leaders and investors. Mugabe's defiance and appeals for national reconciliation may not be enough to prevent further economic and political isolation.
