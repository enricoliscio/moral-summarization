SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite widespread criticism from the opposition and Western governments that the election was rigged and tainted by months of political violence and intimidation. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism, but lawmakers from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change boycotted the ceremony, citing the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. The event was attended by several African heads of state, but representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada protested the election, citing lack of transparency and political violence. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to takeovers of farms and a worsening food shortage. The country is in its fourth year of recession, and international donors have cut funding. Mugabe appealed for reconciliation, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity, which South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing for to avoid deepening international sanctions.
