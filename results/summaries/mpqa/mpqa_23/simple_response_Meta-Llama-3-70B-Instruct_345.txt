SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory as a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, blaming them for the criticism. He vowed to accelerate his land-reform program, seizing fertile land from white commercial farmers to redistribute to poor, landless blacks. The opposition and Western countries boycotted the ceremony, citing political violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities. Mugabe's defiance has led to international donors cutting funding to Zimbabwe, which is experiencing a recession and food shortage. The country's economic woes may worsen if Mugabe refuses to accept a government of national unity, as urged by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. The moral framing of this event is one of authoritarianism, racism, and disregard for democratic principles and human rights.
