SUMMARY:
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against imperialism and racism, blaming the West and whites for aligning against him. The opposition and Western countries boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy due to political violence, intimidation, and electoral law changes. Mugabe remained defiant, pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to international donors cutting funding to Zimbabwe. The country is in a recession and worsening food shortage. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a government of national unity to avoid deepening international sanctions. The election's legitimacy and Mugabe's stance on property rights have raised concerns about Africa's commitment to democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
