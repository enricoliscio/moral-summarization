SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term despite widespread criticism from the opposition and Western governments, who denounced the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism and racism, blaming the criticism on racism. He vowed to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to the seizure of fertile land from white commercial farmers and its redistribution to poor, landless blacks. The opposition and several Western countries boycotted the ceremony, citing political violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities. Mugabe appealed for national reconciliation to address Zimbabwe's economic crisis, but refused to propose a government of national unity. The international community, led by South African President Thabo Mbeki, is pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid deepening sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth.

Moral framing: The article frames Mugabe's actions as a defiance of democratic principles and a perpetuation of authoritarian rule, while the opposition and Western governments are portrayed as champions of democracy and human rights. The article also highlights the moral imperative for African leaders to uphold democratic values and respect property rights.
