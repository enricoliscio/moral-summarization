SUMMARY:
In a display of defiance, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was sworn in for his fifth term following a bitterly contested election marred by allegations of rigging and intimidation. Mugabe's victory was denounced by the opposition and Western governments, who cited political violence, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of voters in the opposition stronghold of Harare. Boycotting the ceremony, opposition lawmakers and Western representatives protested the election's lack of moral legitimacy. 

Mugabe, 78, struck a defiant tone in his speech, framing his win as a triumph over imperialism and racism. He vowed to accelerate his controversial land reform program, seizing land from white commercial farmers for redistribution. Despite calls for reconciliation and a government of national unity, Mugabe's actions have led to economic sanctions and the potential suspension from the Commonwealth. With investors and diplomats watching, the silence of South African President Thabo Mbeki on the election results is notable, as many look to him to denounce the election and reassure the international community of Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. Mugabe's inauguration highlights the complex moral and political landscape of Zimbabwe's recent election.
