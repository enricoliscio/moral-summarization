Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Robert Mugabe's swearing-in in Zimbabwe. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term. The opposition and Western governments are saying the election was rigged. Mugabe gave a speech where he talked about defeating the West and whites, and he called his victory a blow against imperialism. Several African leaders attended, but the opposition lawmakers boycotted the event, as did representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada. They were protesting because of political violence, last-minute electoral law changes, and voter disenfranchisement in Harare.

Mugabe is defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pushing his land-reform program, which has caused international donors to cut funding. Zimbabwe is in a recession and facing food shortages. Mugabe called for national reconciliation but didn't propose a national unity government. South African and Nigerian leaders are pressuring him to accept such a government to avoid sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth. An observer mission from South Africa called the elections legitimate, but Mbeki hasn't commented yet. Western leaders are looking to Mbeki to denounce the results to show Africa's commitment to democracy and property rights. Investors and diplomats might see Mbeki's support as a sign that Africa isn't focused on good governance and trade.

So, the key points are:
- Mugabe sworn in for fifth term after election criticized as rigged.
- Opposition and Western countries boycotted the event.
- Mugabe blamed West and whites, called his win a victory against imperialism.
- Land reform caused funding cuts and economic issues.
- Pressure from African leaders to form unity government.
- South African observer mission called elections legitimate, but Mbeki hasn't commented.
- Western leaders look to Mbeki's stance on democracy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and implications without getting too detailed. I should mention Mugabe's inauguration, the election controversy, the boycotts, his defiant speech, the economic impact, and the regional pressure for unity. Also, touch on the observer mission and Mbeki's potential influence on international perception.

Let me structure it: start with Mugabe's inauguration, mention the election controversy and boycotts. Then talk about his speech and defiance, the land reforms and economic issues. Then mention the pressure from African leaders and the observer mission's stance, ending with the implications for democracy in Africa.

I should make sure it's concise and flows well, hitting all the key points without exceeding the word limit.
