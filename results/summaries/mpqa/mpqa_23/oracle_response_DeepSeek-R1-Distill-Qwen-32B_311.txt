Include the reasons: violence, intimidation, changes in laws, and disenfranchisement. Note the low voter turnout in Harare. Mugabe's defiance and blame on racism. His land reforms leading to funding cuts. The international pressure for a unity government. African leaders' support and the impact on investors' perception.

SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term after a bitterly fought election widely denounced as rigged by the opposition and Western governments. The election was tainted by months of political violence, intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters in Harare. Mugabe, who blamed racism for criticism, celebrated his victory as a blow against imperialism and reaffirmed his land-reform program, which has led to international funding cuts. African leaders, including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, pressed Mugabe to form a national unity government to avoid deeper sanctions. While some African observers deemed the elections legitimate, Western leaders looked to Mbeki to uphold democratic principles. Mugabe's defiance and the ongoing takeovers of white-owned farms highlighted a lack of commitment to transparency and international trade, raising concerns about Africa's intent to revitalize its economies through good governance. END OF SUMMARY.
