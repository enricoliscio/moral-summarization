SUMMARY:
President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office in Zimbabwe, despite the opposition and Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. In his speech, Mugabe claimed victory as a triumph against the West and whites, saying "We have dealt a stunning blow to imperialism." He blamed racism for the criticism and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to the seizure of fertile land from white commercial farmers. The opposition and Western countries boycotted the ceremony, protesting the election's legitimacy due to political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of voters. Mugabe remained defiant, but appealed for reconciliation to address the country's economic needs. The international community is looking to South African President Thabo Mbeki to denounce the results and reassure that Africa is committed to democratic principles and property rights.
