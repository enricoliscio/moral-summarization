SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite a bitterly fought election denounced as rigged by the opposition and many Western governments. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against Western imperialism, but lawmakers from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change boycotted the ceremony, citing an election tainted by months of political violence and intimidation. The event was also shunned by representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada, who protested the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters in Harare. Mugabe remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, which has led to takeovers and occupations of farms. The country's economic woes, including a recession and food shortage, have been exacerbated by a lack of transparency and political violence, leading many international donors to cut funding. Mugabe's refusal to propose a government of national unity has sparked concerns that the country may face deepening international sanctions.
