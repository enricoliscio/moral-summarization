SUMMARY: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term, despite widespread criticism and allegations of rigging. Mugabe's victory speech focused on anti-imperialist and anti-Western rhetoric, blaming racism for the criticism. He pledged to continue his controversial land reform program, which has resulted in international funding cuts and economic recession. Mugabe's inauguration was boycotted by opposition lawmakers and Western representatives, who protested the election's legitimacy due to political violence, changes in electoral laws, and voter disenfranchisement. Mugabe defied the criticism and instead appealed to national reconciliation to address economic issues. South African and Nigerian leaders are urging Mugabe to form a government of national unity to avoid further sanctions and international isolation. The South African observer mission has deemed the elections legitimate, but Western leaders await President Thabo Mbeki's response as a democratic and economic indicator for the region. Investors and diplomats are concerned that support for Mugabe could signal a lack of commitment to good governance and international trade in Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
