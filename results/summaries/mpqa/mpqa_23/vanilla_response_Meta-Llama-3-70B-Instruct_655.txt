SUMMARY:

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe was sworn in for his fifth term in office, despite the opposition and many Western governments denouncing the election as rigged. Mugabe claimed his victory was a triumph against the West and whites, and pledged to accelerate his land-reform program. The ceremony was boycotted by 57 opposition lawmakers and representatives from the US, EU, New Zealand, and Canada, who protested the election's political violence, intimidation, and disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. African heads of state, including Namibia's President Sam Nujoma and the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Joseph Kabila, attended the ceremony. Mugabe appealed for national reconciliation to address Zimbabwe's economic crisis, but did not propose a government of national unity. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept a unity government to avoid international sanctions.
