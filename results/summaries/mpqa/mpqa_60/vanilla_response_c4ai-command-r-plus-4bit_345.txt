SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, there are growing concerns about potential violence and civil unrest regardless of the outcome. Robert Mugabe, the country's longtime leader, is facing a strong challenge from Morgan Tsvangirai, a trade union leader. Surveys show Tsvangirai ahead, but the country's history of political violence and recent changes to election laws have raised fears that the losing side may not accept the results peacefully. Government officials and military leaders have made troubling statements, refusing to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party. There has been an increase in political violence, with 34 people dying this year, mostly MDC supporters. Mugabe's government has been accused of human rights violations during the campaign, which they deny. There are concerns that Mugabe may rig the election by changing voting procedures and disenfranchising young opposition supporters. Political analysts suggest that Mugabe may also use treason charges against Tsvangirai as a last-ditch effort to stay in power. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the MDC's youthful supporters seeking change. Many fear that a disputed outcome could lead to civil unrest or even a coup.
END OF SUMMARY.
