SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, Robert Mugabe, there are growing fears of political violence and civil war. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in violence and accusations of election rigging by Mugabe's party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the results by both sides. Government officials and military leaders have stated they would not accept a victory for Tsvangirai and his party, the MDC, even suggesting they would support a coup. There have been reports of human rights violations, including the deaths of MDC supporters, and allegations that Mugabe has put the armed forces on high alert. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and the MDC's fight against government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. There are concerns that Mugabe may use tactics such as changing election laws and procedures to increase polling stations in rural areas and reduce them in urban MDC strongholds to rig the election. Tsvangirai faces charges of treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe, based on an edited videotape. The outcome is uncertain, with reports of MDC polling agents being abducted and increased violent attacks in swing districts. Many fear that the election could lead to civil unrest, with the potential for rioting and military intervention.
END OF SUMMARY.
