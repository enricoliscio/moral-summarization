SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or oust their longtime leader Robert Mugabe, concerns are mounting about the potential for political violence and civil unrest. Surveys show the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, ahead of Mugabe, but a surge in violence and accusations of election rigging have raised doubts about the acceptance of the results by either party. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), with some even threatening a coup. The opposition has faced intimidation, abductions, and violent attacks, while independent observers worry that changes to election laws and procedures could be used to rig the outcome in Mugabe's favor. The election is seen as a battle between an autocrat and a youthful opposition seeking to end government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. There are fears that a loss for Mugabe could lead to martial law and the jailing of Tsvangirai, while a victory for Mugabe could spark riots and further violence. The tense situation has many Zimbabweans and international observers worried about the country's future stability.
