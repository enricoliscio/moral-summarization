SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in an election that could oust long-serving leader Robert Mugabe, fears of civil war and political violence are running high. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in violent attacks and accusations of election rigging by Mugabe's party have raised concerns about the potential for unrest, with government officials and military leaders refusing to accept a Tsvangirai victory. The government has been accused of human rights violations during the campaign, and there are fears that Mugabe will disenfranchise young opposition supporters and steal the election through various tactics. Tsvangirai and his party face charges of treason and plotting to kill Mugabe, based on edited footage. Analysts suggest these charges could be a last-ditch effort by Mugabe to maintain power should he lose. The outcome remains uncertain, as violent attacks in swing districts and changes to election laws and procedures may sway the vote in Mugabe's favor. The moral framing of this article centers around the potential for immoral and unethical actions by both sides, including violence, rigging, and treason.
