SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or re-elect their president, the prospect of civil war looms large. The incumbent, Robert Mugabe, faces a strong challenge from opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, and both sides have made it clear that they may not accept a loss. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party has been accused of rigging the election through changing laws and procedures, and there have been reports of violence and abductions of polling agents. Senior government officials and military leaders have also stated their refusal to accept a Tsvangirai victory, even suggesting they would support a coup. The country's tense atmosphere has many worried that the loser of the election, regardless of the outcome, will respond with force, leading to civil unrest or even war. The moral dilemma lies in how to ensure a peaceful transition of power and prevent potential bloodshed, with fears that Mugabe may declare martial law and jail Tsvangirai on questionable charges if he loses. The outcome is uncertain, but the world watches with bated breath as Zimbabwe's future hangs in the balance.
