SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in an election that could oust longtime leader Robert Mugabe, there are widespread concerns about the potential for political violence and civil unrest. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but the country's history of political violence and recent accusations of election rigging have many worried about the potential for post-election turmoil. Government officials and military leaders have suggested they would not accept a victory for Tsvangirai's MDC party, and there have been reports of increased political violence and intimidation tactics. The MDC has also accused the governing ZANU-PF party of changing election laws and procedures to rig the vote in their favor. With the outcome of the election uncertain and tensions running high, many fear that the loser's supporters may resort to violence or other extreme measures, potentially leading to a civil war or a military coup. The situation has raised concerns among election monitors, foreign diplomats, and Zimbabwean citizens alike.
