SUMMARY:

As Zimbabwe prepares for elections, many fear violence and civil war regardless of the outcome. The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the government has been accused of rigging the vote and using violence to intimidate opponents. Senior government officials have threatened to not accept a Tsvangirai victory, with one even suggesting they would support a coup. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the armed forces on high alert. Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocratic leader desperate to remain in power and an opposition party dominated by young citizens weary of government corruption and mismanagement. The outcome is uncertain, with both sides capable of violence and manipulation.
