SUMMARY:
As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or oust long-time leader Robert Mugabe, there is a palpable fear of potential violence and civil unrest, with many wondering if the losers will accept the outcome. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by the governing party have raised concerns. Government officials and military leaders have made disturbing statements, refusing to accept a victory for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). At least 34 people, mostly MDC supporters, have died in political violence this year. The government has been accused of human rights violations during the campaign, which they deny. There are fears that Mugabe will disenfranchise young opposition supporters and steal the election. Tsvangirai has said he would not prosecute Mugabe if he wins, but there are concerns that Mugabe could jail him on treason charges. The outcome is uncertain, with the opposition alleging abduction of their polling agents and a surge in violent attacks in swing districts. The governing party's changes to election laws and procedures further fuel concerns about the legitimacy of the vote. Mugabe's actions indicate a desperate attempt to cling to power, potentially setting the stage for a violent post-election scenario in Zimbabwe.
