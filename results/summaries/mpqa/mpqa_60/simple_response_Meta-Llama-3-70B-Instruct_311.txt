SUMMARY:

As Zimbabweans prepare to vote in the presidential election, fears of violence and unrest are mounting. The challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is ahead in surveys, but the ruling party's attempts to rig the vote and the military's refusal to accept a Tsvangirai government have raised concerns about the outcome. Senior government officials have made disturbing pronouncements, including a threat to support a coup if Tsvangirai wins. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, mostly opposition supporters. The government has been accused of human rights violations and has put the armed forces on "high alert". Many Zimbabweans see the election as a contest between an autocrat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party fighting against corruption and poverty. The outcome is uncertain, with both sides accused of manipulating the vote. The moral imperative is clear: the Zimbabwean people deserve a free and fair election, and the international community must hold the government accountable for any human rights abuses.
