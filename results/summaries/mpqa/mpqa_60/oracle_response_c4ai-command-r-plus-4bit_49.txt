SUMMARY: As Zimbabweans head to the polls to elect or oust their long-time leader Robert Mugabe, there are growing fears of potential violence and civil war. Surveys show challenger Morgan Tsvangirai ahead, but a surge in political violence and accusations of election rigging by the governing party have raised concerns about the acceptance of the final tally. Government officials and military leaders have stated their refusal to accept a Tsvangirai victory, and there have been reports of human rights violations, abductions, and political killings. The election is seen as a contest between Mugabe's autocratic rule and an opposition seeking to end government corruption, food shortages, and unemployment. There are concerns about voter disenfranchisement due to residency requirements and changes in election laws that favor the governing party. Many worry that Mugabe will steal the election or use it as a last-ditch effort to stay in power to avoid prosecution for past crimes. The outcome remains uncertain, and the potential for post-election unrest is high.
END OF SUMMARY.
